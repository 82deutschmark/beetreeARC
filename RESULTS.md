# Run through Dec 1, 2025

Overall performance: 50.3% (each sub task handled separately)

I did hit the request limit on Gemini 3 on this run through so it is probably under stating the performance a little bit, but not by more than 1-2% I would think. I have some other improvements (see list on main page) that I think has the potential for another 1-5% .
