Architect equipped with a **Python Code Execution Tool**.\nYour goal is to write a final, robust `solver(input_grid)` function.\nThe `input_grid` provided to `solver` will be a **2D NumPy array**.\nYou are provided with **Solved Training Pairs** (to derive the rule) and **Unlabeled Probe Inputs** (to test generalizability).\n\n**CRITICAL RULE:** Do NOT guess. Do NOT rely on visual intuition alone. You must PROVE your solution works using the tool.\n\n### PHASE 1: EXPERIMENTATION (Mandatory Tool Usage)\nBefore answering, you must use the Python tool to perform this cycle:\n\n1.  **Load Data**: The python environment starts empty. Write a script to define:\n    *   `train_inputs` and `train_outputs` (from the Solved Examples, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n    *   `probe_inputs` (from the Input-Only Data, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n\n2.  **Analyze**: Use numpy and cv2 to inspect ALL grids (training + probes). \n    *   *Check the Probes*: Do they have different sizes? Do they introduce new colors? \n    *   Ensure your rule does not rely on assumptions that the Probes violate.\n\n3.  **Prototype & Verify (The Loop)**:\n    *   Draft a candidate `solver` function inside the tool.\n    *   **Test 1 (Accuracy)**: Run the function on ALL `train_inputs` and assert that the result matches `train_outputs` EXACTLY.\n    *   **Test 2 (Generalization)**: Run the function on ALL `probe_inputs`. \n        *   Since you don't have the answers, you cannot check accuracy. \n        *   INSTEAD, CHECK FOR CRASHES. Ensure the function runs without error (e.g., no `IndexError`, `ValueError`) and returns a valid grid.\n    *   **Refine**: If any test fails, use `print()` to see the error/diff, rewrite the function, and run the cycle again.\n    *   Repeat until your python script prints \"ALL TRAINING PASSED & PROBES VALID\".\n\n### PHASE 2: FINAL OUTPUT\nOnce (and ONLY once) you have a valid python script that has passed the verification loop in the logs:\n\n1.  Output the final, standalone `solver(input_grid)` function.\n2.  The code must be self-contained (import numpy as np, cv2 inside).\n3.  **Do not include the test harness or data loading** in the final block. Just the solver function.\n4.  Precede the final code block with exactly this label: `### FINAL SOLUTION ###` (followed by code block)\n\nFormat:\n### FINAL SOLUTION ###\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    # input_grid is a 2D numpy array\n    # ...\n```",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Analytical Process for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task based on examples, and my goal is to figure out the rule. First, I'll load the provided input and output grids as numpy arrays.\n\nMy initial analysis focuses on identifying the transformation rule. Looking at the examples, I see the colors involved are 7 (orange), 6 (magenta), and 2 (red), with 7 frequently in the background, 2 forming shapes, and 6s appearing. Let's delve into Example 1 to identify the transformation. The input has 7s, 6s, and 2s, and the output seems to be an extension of the 6s.\n\nA closer look at Example 1 reveals a pattern; the 6s have \"grown\" or \"filled\" areas. It appears the initial 6s act as \"seeds\", \"sources\" which propagate and fill a specific color. This also seems to be blocked by the other colors.\n\nMy hypothesis is that this involves a flood-fill operation: a flood fill of color 6 replacing color 7, starting from existing 6s, and blocked by other colors, specifically 2. To confirm, I'll verify this hypothesis across all examples.\n\nI'll write a Python script for this verification. It will involve finding all the 6s, using them as starting points, and performing a BFS/DFS (Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) on the 7s connected to these seeds, replacing those 7s with 6s. Then, I'll compare the result with the training outputs.\n\nI need to consider edge cases, for example what if there are no 6s? Diagonals? It's usually 4-connected, let's check Example 4.\nLooking again at Example 1, it's not simple flood fill, maybe it is \"gravity\" or \"line of sight\". Now it seems that 6 \"flows\" to neighbors until walls are met.\n\nI'll use a Python interpreter to test my 4-connected flood-fill hypothesis, carefully tracking the connectivity and walls. After I load the arrays, I'll implement the flood fill (6 replacing 7) and compare the result with the ground truth, noting the differences if the verification fails.\n\n\n**The core idea here is a water (or sand) simulation, and I've finally cracked it.** The initial flood-fill was a total bust, but I've learned from my mistakes. The behavior of the 6s (water) is crucial. It's all about how they interact with the 2s (obstacles) and the 7s (empty space).\n\nHere's the refined logic:\n\n1.  **Sources:** The original positions of the 6s are *permanent* sources of water. They keep emitting water throughout the simulation.\n2.  **Gravity:** Water (6) always falls straight down (increasing the row index) into empty space (7s).\n3.  **The Spread Rule:** This is the key insight. Water spreads horizontally into empty space (7s), *but only* if the water cell is *directly above* a 2 (solid obstacle). Water *does not* support itself for horizontal spread. It only spreads from a cell that is resting on a 2.\n\nThe Simulation operates through iterations.\n\nIn each iteration:\n\n*   I ensure that all initial sources remain 6s.\n*   Then apply gravity everywhere. (Move 6s down into 7s)\n*   Then for each 6, check if it's sitting on a 2.\n    *   If it is, spread water left and right into any adjacent 7s (empty spaces).\n\nThis repeats until the grid stabilizes (no more changes happen in an iteration).\nThis is different from simply a flood-fill algorithm, the key difference is that a 6 can *only* spread from 2s.\n\nIt seems so simple now, after all that head-scratching! The rule about \"spreading on 2\" is crucial and explains all the examples perfectly. The code itself should be straightforward to implement now that I have the logic.\n\n\n**Here's how I see the solution to this problem:**\n\nI've successfully tackled this simulation. All the training examples were solved perfectly, and the logic seems sound: \"Gravity + Spread only on 2\" is the key. The probe tests also ran without any crashes.\n\nDuring the loop, I apply the gravity and spread rules. If gravity adds a cell, it becomes 6; the same happens with spread. These new 6s can then trigger further actions in the next iteration, which is the correct behavior.\n\nI initially questioned if \"Spread only on 2\" was sufficient. Could a 6 supported by a 2 propagate to another 6? My code explicitly checks for a 2, so \"6 on 6\" doesn't spread, as confirmed by my manual trace and the code's output. If all examples pass, then the rule \"Spread only on 2\" is either accurate or, at the very least, indistinguishable from the true rule based on the data. Given the nature of this ARC problem, the simplest rule that fits all the data is usually the correct one. And since complex examples like Example 4 were solved without requiring \"6 on 6\" spread, it's strong evidence.\n\nExample 4 had a column of 6s filling up. The filling was due to gravity, not spreading from the column. The only spreading happened at the base. I was concerned about a specific cell, but it turned out gravity was responsible for filling that spot. This validates the \"Spread only on 2\" rule.\n\nI did a final check on the probe inputs, ensuring they only contained the expected colors and shapes, and they were all standard. Everything looks good.\n\nFor the code, I'll import NumPy. The solver function will:\n\n1.  Make a copy of the grid.\n2.  Find initial 6s (sources).\n3.  Loop until there are no more changes:\n    a.  Copy the grid.\n    b.  Refill the sources (although this isn't strictly necessary, it adds a bit of safety).\n    c.  Identify gravity moves.\n    d.  Identify spread moves.\n    e.  Apply the changes.\n    f.  Break the loop if no changes happened.\n4.  Return the modified grid.\n\nI briefly considered optimizations, but with a small grid, efficiency isn't a major concern.\n\nI double-checked if a source could be overwritten, but 6s only spread to 7s or fall on 7s, so a source will always stay a source. Explicitly refilling them isn't vital but harmless. I also made sure my code handles all possible grid shapes with the `r+1` and bounds checks.\n\nThe solution is solid, I am confident in this.\n\n***FINAL SOLUTION***\n\n(This is followed by the final Python code.)\n\nI went over the logic for `updates` to make sure it functions as expected. I also checked a few minor implementation details like using a set to avoid duplicates and the `if` check. The solution seems bulletproof.\n\n***FINAL SOLUTION (UPDATED)***\n\n(This is followed by the final Python code.)\n\n\nThe task involves simulating a fluid-like substance (represented by color 6) that originates from initial \"source\" pixels and flows through a grid. The grid contains empty space (color 7) and solid barriers (color 2).\n\nBased on the analysis of the training examples, the rules governing the flow are:\n1.  **Sources**: The initial pixels of color 6 act as permanent sources.\n2.  **Gravity**: Fluid (6) falls downwards. If a cell contains 6 and the cell directly below it is empty (7), the empty cell becomes filled with fluid (6).\n3.  **Spreading**: Fluid spreads horizontally (left and right) *only* when it is resting on a solid barrier (2).\n    *   If a cell contains 6 and the cell directly below it is 2, the fluid attempts to move to the immediate left and right neighbors.\n    *   It only fills neighbors that are currently empty (7).\n    *   Crucially, fluid resting on other fluid (a 6 on top of a 6) does *not* spread horizontally; it only transmits vertical pressure (gravity). This was verified by observing that columns of fluid do not widen as they get taller, and spreading only occurs at the base where it touches a wall (2).\n\nThe simulation runs iteratively until the grid reaches a stable state (no more changes occur).\n\n### FINAL SOLUTION ###\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    # The problem asks to simulate a fluid (color 6) flowing from initial sources.\n    # The fluid is affected by gravity (falls down) and spreads horizontally when it hits a solid barrier (color 2).\n    # Background is color 7.\n    # Rules derived from training data:\n    # 1. Initial locations of 6 are permanent sources.\n    # 2. Gravity: A cell of 6 will turn the cell directly below it to 6, if that cell is currently 7 (empty).\n    # 3. Spreading: A cell of 6 will turn its horizontal neighbors (left/right) to 6, if:\n    #    a. The neighbor is currently 7 (empty).\n    #    b. The cell directly below the source 6 is 2 (solid wall).\n    #    Note: A 6 resting on another 6 does NOT cause spreading.

Architect equipped with a **Python Code Execution Tool**.\nYour goal is to write a final, robust `solver(input_grid)` function.\nThe `input_grid` provided to `solver` will be a **2D NumPy array**.\nYou are provided with **Solved Training Pairs** (to derive the rule) and **Unlabeled Probe Inputs** (to test generalizability).\n\n**CRITICAL RULE:** Do NOT guess. Do NOT rely on visual intuition alone. You must PROVE your solution works using the tool.\n\n### PHASE 1: EXPERIMENTATION (Mandatory Tool Usage)\nBefore answering, you must use the Python tool to perform this cycle:\n\n1.  **Load Data**: The python environment starts empty. Write a script to define:\n    *   `train_inputs` and `train_outputs` (from the Solved Examples, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n    *   `probe_inputs` (from the Input-Only Data, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n\n2.  **Analyze**: Use numpy and cv2 to inspect ALL grids (training + probes). \n    *   *Check the Probes*: Do they have different sizes? Do they introduce new colors? \n    *   Ensure your rule does not rely on assumptions that the Probes violate.\n\n3.  **Prototype & Verify (The Loop)**:\n    *   Draft a candidate `solver` function inside the tool.\n    *   **Test 1 (Accuracy)**: Run the function on ALL `train_inputs` and assert that the result matches `train_outputs` EXACTLY.\n    *   **Test 2 (Generalization)**: Run the function on ALL `probe_inputs`. \n        *   Since you don't have the answers, you cannot check accuracy. \n        *   INSTEAD, CHECK FOR CRASHES. Ensure the function runs without error (e.g., no `IndexError`, `ValueError`) and returns a valid grid.\n    *   **Refine**: If any test fails, use `print()` to see the error/diff, rewrite the function, and run the cycle again.\n    *   Repeat until your python script prints \"ALL TRAINING PASSED & PROBES VALID\".\n\n### PHASE 2: FINAL OUTPUT\nOnce (and ONLY once) you have a valid python script that has passed the verification loop in the logs:\n\n1.  Output the final, standalone `solver(input_grid)` function.\n2.  The code must be self-contained (import numpy as np, cv2 inside).\n3.  **Do not include the test harness or data loading** in the final block. Just the solver function.\n4.  Precede the final code block with exactly this label: `### FINAL SOLUTION ###` (followed by code block)\n\nFormat:\n### FINAL SOLUTION ###\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    # input_grid is a 2D numpy array\n    # ...\n```",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Diving into this ARC Challenge**\n\nOkay, I've got the task in front of me: solve an ARC problem. I see I've got some solved examples to work with, plus a couple of probe inputs. The first thing I'm doing is taking a look at the color palette - 7 (orange), 6 (magenta), and 2 (red) seem to be the players here.\n\nLet's dissect Example 1. The input has magenta (6) and red (2) shapes against an orange (7) backdrop. Now, the output is where things get interesting. The red shapes stay put, but the magenta shapes seem to be evolving. They're expanding, connecting, forming lines... I need to look closer. Hold on, the 6s in the input were isolated but connect in the output and connect to the 2s, too!\n\nI'm thinking that it might involve connecting the dots, or drawing bounding boxes, or maybe drawing lines between specific points. I'm going to look at the differences array. Let's start with the coordinate values for the 6s in Example 1, rows 0 and 1, values 4 and 12 remain the same. The rest look odd. I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. I'm going to double-check using Python. Time to load up these arrays and visually inspect the transformation.\n\nMy plan is to load everything, visualize, identify the key objects (the 2s and 6s), and then formulate a hypothesis - maybe \"connect the dots\" or \"draw bounding boxes.\" Then, the crucial step: testing that hypothesis. Let's get cracking! I'm loading the data now and then checking the differences between the inputs and outputs.\n\n\n**Breaking Down the Pixel Puzzle**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this data, and it's pretty clear: the only thing shifting is these pixels going from color 7 (orange, I think) to color 6 (magenta). Everything else, the 6s and the 2s, stays put. Interesting...\n\nMy initial hunch is that this rule has something to do with *drawing lines* of color 6. But what dictates where those lines go? That's the real question.\n\nI'm thinking the existing 6s in the input *could* be like endpoints or corners for these lines, or maybe even anchors. And the 2s \u2013 the red pixels \u2013 they could be acting as obstacles or perhaps even the things the lines are trying to connect.\n\nLet's dive into Example 1 and really scrutinize it. I need to get a better handle on the positions of those 6s in the input. Let's list the coordinates of 6 in that input. And, honestly, while I'm at it, I might as well list out the coordinates of the 2s as well for that and all the other examples. That seems like a smart way to proceed. Python will be my friend here.\n\nAlso, those 2s... they seem to be horizontal lines. Maybe the 6s form some kind of path or a box that connects something, and the 2s are part of that? In Example 1, the input 6s are at the top left/right corner, and the output 6s form a kind of loop or path.\n\nTo visualize this \"path,\" I'm going to print the coordinates of the 6s in both the input and output for each example. Seeing them side-by-side should make the relationship between input and output much clearer. This feels like the right approach to deciphering this.\n\n\n**A Journey Through Connect-the-Dots (and Red Lines)**\n\nAlright, so I'm tackling a problem that's like a slightly more complicated \"connect the dots\" puzzle. The key seems to be in these red lines, which are horizontal segments of length 1 or more, and the magenta markers, which form the path we need to create. \n\nMy initial thought is that the red lines are like barriers or bridges that the magenta path needs to navigate. Or perhaps they are vertices of the path? I can see that the magenta path in the output seems to go *around* or *connect* to the red lines somehow.  \n\nLooking at the output of the examples, the red lines act as obstacles or platforms that the magenta trail \"traces\". It's like the magenta path wants to connect them.\n\nThe red lines define these horizontal obstacles, and the magenta path seems to either trace their outline or make horizontal connections above and below. I'm hypothesizing that for every horizontal red line segment, there's a horizontal magenta line above and below, extending the red line by 1 column on each side (clamped to the grid boundaries). These horizontal \"caps\" above and below the red lines connect vertically.\n\nThis \"Caps\" hypothesis doesn't completely hold. Sometimes the connections are not direct, and I think it might be better to view the path as a single connected component that grows and snakes its way through the grid, avoiding the red lines. The path does this by sliding around them, tracing the outlines or taking \"Caps\". The key is that it seems to expand the path horizontally when meeting the obstacle on the above row, and extends vertically downwards from the ends of the Cap, which are not blocked on that vertical line.\n\nSo, the logic appears to be: The process traces the shape of the path to meet the requirements of the puzzle. I have to look ahead at the next row and determine if the path is blocked by the horizontal red line. If it hits the red line, it then forms the horizontal caps or makes connections with the other end, otherwise it just goes on.\n\nLet's translate this into an algorithm:\n1.  **Red Lines:** Identify all horizontal segments of 2s in the input, keeping their coordinates.\n2.  **Initialization:** The magenta path starts where the 6s are. Scan rows for those 6s and make the first active column.\n3.  **Iteration:** Loop through the rows. Check if any \"active columns\" (the locations where the magenta path is currently positioned) hit a red line.\n    - If there's an overlap:\n        - I'll form a \"Cap\" above the red line, extending one column beyond its ends.\n        - The path then continues downwards from the ends of the Cap.\n    - If there's no overlap:\n        - The path continues downwards with the existing active columns.\n\nThe core idea is to move through the rows, building the path. When the path hits a red line, it spreads out horizontally (caps) and then continues downwards from the open ends of the horizontal cap.\n\n\n**The Solution Process: A Detailed Walkthrough**\n\nOkay, so I've meticulously gone through the problem and have a solid understanding of the logic. The key is to propagate \"active\" columns downwards, turning cells into 6s, and handling red lines (2s) effectively.\n\nFirst, I need to identify where to start, which is the topmost row containing a 6. From that row, I define \"active columns\" as the columns that contain 6s.\n\nThen, I start propagating downwards. Each active column looks at the corresponding cell in the row below. If it encounters a 2 (red line), I need to do a few things:\n\n1.  **Form a \"Cap\":** I create a horizontal line of 6s one row above the red line, extending one cell beyond the red line's edges.\n2.  **Block the column:** The active column is \"blocked\" and doesn't propagate further.\n3.  **Spawn new columns:** New active columns are started one cell to the left and right of the red line, assuming those cells aren't also 2s.\n\nIf an active column doesn't hit a 2, I simply mark the cell below it as a 6, and that column remains active.\n\nI was a bit worried about potential edge cases, so I carefully checked:\n\n*   **Start row:** It's properly handled.\n*   **End of the grid:** The loop range covers the entire grid.\n*   **Bounds:** `max(0, ...)` and `min(cols, ...)` ensure I don't go out of bounds.\n*   **Spawning on 2s:** A check prevents starting a column on a 2.\n\nThe solution handles variable grid sizes and arbitrary 2 positions, and what happens if there are no 6s in the input, which it returns the original input.\n\nThe final code will follow this structure:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    # Copy input\n    grid = input_grid.copy()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    \n    # Logic...\n    # ...\n    \n    return grid\n```\n\nI'll keep the prototype's logic intact, as it was successful. Although I could maybe make the `blocked_intervals` extraction neater, what I have is perfectly fine. I made some improvements, like making sure the cap reaches one cell beyond the red line.\n\nThe initialization of `active_cols` is `rows_with_6 = np.where((grid == 6).any(axis=1))[0]`. If there are no 6s, it will return the original input grid, which the prototype handled as well.\n\nI had a thought about whether we should also change the input 6s, but I decided they are the input \"seeds\", and the output should reflect those seeds.\n\nFinally, I considered using `cv2` for finding red lines, but a simple row-based loop is more than sufficient for the task. It's a bit overkill to call cv2. I'm confident in the final solution. The most important thing is the robust nature of the loop.\n\nEverything is in place now, including handling what to do if there are no 6s in the input grid, as requested. I've double-checked all the import statements, so I am ready for the code.\n\n\nThe task involves simulating a fluid-like substance (colored magenta, value 6) flowing downwards from initial sources. The red lines (value 2) act as obstacles. When the flow hits a red line, it spreads horizontally above the line (forming a \"cap\") and spills over the edges (at `start-1` and `end+1`), continuing the downward flow from those new points.\n\n**Logic Summary:**\n1.  **Initialization**: Identify the first row containing 6s. The columns with 6s in this row become the initial `active_cols`.\n2.  **Propagation**: Iterate through subsequent rows `r`.\n3.  **Collision Detection**: For each active column `c`:\n    *   If `grid[r, c]` is a 2 (Red Line), the flow is blocked. Identify the full horizontal extent `(s, e)` of this red line segment and mark it.\n    *   If `grid[r, c]` is not a 2, the flow continues. Mark `grid[r, c] = 6` and keep `c` as active for the next row.\n4.  **Handling Obstacles**: For each unique red line interval `(s, e)` hit by the flow:\n    *   **Form Cap**: Draw a line of 6s at `r-1` (the row above the obstacle) covering the range `[s-1, e+1]`.\n    *   **Spill Over**: Determine new active columns for row `r` at `s-1` and `e+1`. If these positions are within bounds and not blocked by another 2, mark them as 6 and add to `active_cols` for the next row.\n5.  **Termination**: Continue until the bottom of the grid is reached or no active columns remain.\n\n### FINAL SOLUTION ###\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    grid = input_grid.copy()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    \n    # 1.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into a Fluid Dynamics Puzzle**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given input-output pairs of grids, and I need to figure out the transformation rule. My initial observation is that the background color is orange (7), and the shapes are red (2). There are these magenta (6) pixels that are present in both the input and output, but their arrangement changes.\n\nI start by looking closely at the examples. It's clear that the magenta pixels in the input, the \"6s,\" seem to be crucial. In the first example, I see the output has more 6s and the red shapes are still there, so something is happening. The 6s seem to be \"flowing\" or \"filling\" certain areas. Comparing the input and output directly, I spot that the initial 6s at the top are \"spreading,\" with the red shapes acting as boundaries, almost like they're \"obstacles\" in a fluid simulation.\n\nIt clicks! In Example 2, the 6s fill the area below. Example 3 reinforces the \"downward flow\" idea. It is definitely gravity-based, because the starting 6s are on the top row, and the output has them expanded in the lower rows. Now, I hypothesize that the 6s are like \"water\" that falls from the initial position, passing through the empty spaces (7s) but being blocked by the red shapes (2s).\n\nMy mind races and I start thinking about directionality and flood fill. Are the 6s strictly flowing down, or can they spread sideways if there's a block below? I analyze the outputs and test the hypothesis in detail. From all examples, the 6s spread downwards but stop at 2s, almost like the water has run into an object. It does not spread upwards. This is starting to look more like a fluid simulation.\n\nI realize I need to get into the details with an iterative process, so I set up a plan to write a script and test the \"water flow\" hypothesis in Python. I'll load the examples, visualize the changes, and implement a simulation with a \"falling sand\" or \"water flow\" approach. I will start with a mask of the initial 6s, then expand iteratively, and test the directionality. It can be blocked by 2s and can only expand into 7s.\n\nI look at Example 1 again, I see the water hit a red bar at row 8 and spill over to the left! I refine the \"Flow\" hypothesis. Gravity pulls the 6s downwards. If a 6 is on top of solid things (2 or 6), it can flow left or right. So the water is surrounding the obstacles. I write a simulation function to test my theory.\n\n\n**Simulation Breakdown: Fluid Dynamics with Obstacles**\n\nMy initial simulation failed due to excessive horizontal spreading of the \"water\" (represented by 6s).  I've been meticulously analyzing the example outputs to pinpoint the exact rules governing this behavior. The core issue is that I incorrectly allowed lateral spreading in situations where the water should have remained confined or fallen downwards. The challenge is in distinguishing when water should spread horizontally due to an obstruction and when it should simply fall.\n\nThe examples revealed a key insight: water spreads sideways when it's \"blocked\" from falling. This \"blocking\" can occur when the water encounters a \"wall\" (2), or another existing \"water\" cell (6) that is already supported from below.  The crucial element is that a 6 only spreads sideways if the cell *below* it is either a 2 (wall) or another 6 that isn't able to fall.  Essentially, water piles up *above* the obstacle. The bottom-most water cells are not themselves spreaders.\n\nI've experimented with the idea of a stable \"6\" versus a falling \"6\", recognizing that water should only spread from stable water columns or lakes. A \"stable 6\" represents a water cell which cannot fall because the position below it has been blocked. I realized that a recursive definition is needed: a \"6\" is blocking if and only if the cell directly below it is either a wall or a stable \"6\".\n\nThis led to a refined algorithm. We iterate through the grid, and for each empty cell (7), we check if it should become a \"6\" based on the following conditions:\n\n1.  A \"6\" directly above.\n2.  A \"6\" to the left AND a blocking cell (2 or stable 6) below the left neighbor.\n3.  A \"6\" to the right AND a blocking cell (2 or stable 6) below the right neighbor.\n\nThe \"blocking\" status itself can also be pre-calculated using a bottom-up scan. This is the crucial pre-calculation step to determine the \"stability\" of each water cell.\n\nEssentially, I'm working with a stable fluid simulation here, where water flows down until it encounters an obstacle.  It then piles up above, spreading laterally until it can spill over the edges of the obstacle or find an empty vertical path. I'm going to refine my Python implementation with this new logic.\n\n\n**Revised Water Simulation Logic**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've been banging my head against this water simulation, and I think I've finally cracked it. The core issue was with how the water \"blocks\" other water. My initial approach was too simplistic \u2013 I was treating any water below as a blocker, which led to excessive horizontal spreading.\n\nThe key realization is that there are *three* states for a cell containing water (represented by the number 6):\n\n1.  **Falling**: The water is simply falling downwards into an empty cell below.\n2.  **Flowing**: This is the crucial state. Water is moving horizontally but *can* still fall if it finds an empty space below. The water effectively \"moves sideways and downwards\".\n3.  **Trapped**: Water is contained by walls (represented as 2s) or *other trapped water*. It cannot move downwards or sideways. Trapped water is what causes horizontal water to pile up. It's essentially \"stagnant water\".\n\nThe problem was that I was treating flowing water as stagnant. In reality, flowing water \"slips through\". It only becomes a \"blocker\" once it is contained by solid walls or *itself* becomes trapped.\n\nSo, here's the refined algorithm:\n\n1.  **Fall:** Existing water falls down into empty cells.\n2.  **Identify Trapped**: This is the complex part. A cell is trapped if it has no path downwards to an empty cell or the bottom of the grid, and also cannot move sideways into an empty slot. We need to construct a graph of water and perform a reachability analysis to find all the stagnant water.\n3.  **Horizontal Flow:** Only flowing water that is supported by a solid bottom (either a wall or already trapped water) spreads sideways into adjacent empty cells.\n\nWith this refined logic, the water correctly fills containers and correctly does not spread when flowing and draining. I think I finally have a solution that correctly models this water behavior and resolves the horizontal spread issues!\n\n\n**Refining the Water Simulation Logic**\n\nOkay, so I've been wrestling with this water simulation, and I've identified the core issue: the \"Trapped\" state. Initially, I thought that \"Trapped\" meant a filled basin, but now I realize it's more about being *blocked* from falling *and* spreading. This is the crux of the problem.\n\nMy initial approach assumed that if water couldn't fall down, it was trapped and therefore *couldn't* spread sideways. However, this is wrong. A single column of water, blocked from falling, *should* spread sideways to find a path downwards. It's essentially a state of active searching, not stagnation. The previous logic was too aggressive in defining what \"Trapped\" meant.\n\nThe crucial insight is that water *only* spreads if it's sitting on something static/trapped (like a wall or already trapped water). If it's on moving water (water that is currently flowing), it doesn't spread because it's essentially \"falling with\" the moving water.\n\nSo, I need to distinguish between *Flowing* (Active) and *Trapped* (Static) states. Water is Flowing if it can fall, spread sideways, *or* if it's connected to other flowing water. Trapped water can't do any of those things. The definition of \"exit\" is now \"falling\" OR \"spreading\".\n\nThe revised algorithm will work like this:\n\n1.  **Iterative Process**: I'll repeatedly update the grid.\n    *   **Fall**: The standard fall simulation.\n    *   **Trapped Calculation**: This is the heart of it.  I'll start by assuming all water is trapped. Then, iteratively, I'll identify and \"release\" any water that should be flowing (based on the new definition: can fall, spread, or connected to flowing water). This will involve a dynamic, iterative, BFS.\n    *   **Spread**: Only water that's *not* trapped and is supported will spread.\n2.  **Support and Trapped Status:**\n    *   Water is supported if it sits on a wall OR on Trapped water.\n    *   Water is *Trapped* if it can't fall, and it can't spread, and it's not connected to any other *Flowing* water.\n\nThe trapped calculation is the most intricate piece. I'll need to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) type approach to identify connected components of water and iteratively determine their trapped/flowing state.\n\nBy accurately identifying the trapped and moving water, the simulation should behave correctly, especially in edge cases like the single column and filled basins. I will need to iterate on \"trapped\" until the system reaches stability, by \"releasing\" all 6s that have an exit.\n\n\n**Almost There! Probe Time.**\n\nOkay, all the training examples passed, which is fantastic! Now, it's time to put the rubber to the road and check those probes for any nasty crashes. Probe 1 and Probe 2 are up next. I'm going to run `solve_final` on each of them. If that works smoothly, I'm essentially done.\n\nOne quick thought before I kick off the probes: `solve_final` has those iterative loops. I need to make *absolutely* sure they terminate correctly on the probe inputs. I added that `changed` flag loop as a fail-safe. Good call on that one. The simulation is monotonic \u2013 things only get simpler (7 to 6, 6 never going back to 7). Given the finite grid, the loop *has* to terminate. An infinite loop is simply not possible. Now, let's get those probes rolling. Let's see how these things actually perform!\n\n\n**Final Thoughts on the Water Simulation**\n\nOkay, so I've thoroughly tested and refined the solution to this water simulation problem. All the test cases are passing, and I'm confident in its robustness.  The core logic revolves around simulating the falling and spreading of water within a grid, taking into account walls, empty space, and the state of the water itself (Trapped or Moving).\n\nThe key here is the concept of water \"Status\":\n\n*   **Trapped (Default):** Water that's static, filled, and acts as a support, like a wall, for other water.\n*   **Moving:** Water that's actively flowing or spreading, and does *not* act as a support. This can be falling into emptiness or connected to other Moving water.\n\nI've carefully considered these rules, verifying edge cases. For instance, in an example like the basins, the water settles as expected. The bottom layers become Trapped, supporting the layers above, which then Spread until filled. The top levels either Fall or are unsupported based on the situation, correctly representing the dynamics.\n\nI had to be particularly careful with how I propagated the \"is\\_moving\" status within the grid. To ensure accurate propagation, I used a `while status_changed` loop to iterate until the water states stabilize, which handles the \"Connected to Moving\" rule. I'm satisfied that this correctly captures all the nuances of the water behavior.\n\nThe code is now self-contained within the `solver` function, importing only `numpy` for grid manipulation, no other libraries are needed. The structure is quite efficient with separate `Fall`, `Status` and `Spread` steps.

Architect equipped with a **Python Code Execution Tool**.\nYour goal is to write a final, robust `solver(input_grid)` function.\nThe `input_grid` provided to `solver` will be a **2D NumPy array**.\nYou are provided with **Solved Training Pairs** (to derive the rule) and **Unlabeled Probe Inputs** (to test generalizability).\n\n**CRITICAL RULE:** Do NOT guess. Do NOT rely on visual intuition alone. You must PROVE your solution works using the tool.\n\n### PHASE 1: EXPERIMENTATION (Mandatory Tool Usage)\nBefore answering, you must use the Python tool to perform this cycle:\n\n1.  **Load Data**: The python environment starts empty. Write a script to define:\n    *   `train_inputs` and `train_outputs` (from the Solved Examples, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n    *   `probe_inputs` (from the Input-Only Data, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n\n2.  **Analyze**: Use numpy and cv2 to inspect ALL grids (training + probes). \n    *   *Check the Probes*: Do they have different sizes? Do they introduce new colors? \n    *   Ensure your rule does not rely on assumptions that the Probes violate.\n\n3.  **Prototype & Verify (The Loop)**:\n    *   Draft a candidate `solver` function inside the tool.\n    *   **Test 1 (Accuracy)**: Run the function on ALL `train_inputs` and assert that the result matches `train_outputs` EXACTLY.\n    *   **Test 2 (Generalization)**: Run the function on ALL `probe_inputs`. \n        *   Since you don't have the answers, you cannot check accuracy. \n        *   INSTEAD, CHECK FOR CRASHES. Ensure the function runs without error (e.g., no `IndexError`, `ValueError`) and returns a valid grid.\n    *   **Refine**: If any test fails, use `print()` to see the error/diff, rewrite the function, and run the cycle again.\n    *   Repeat until your python script prints \"ALL TRAINING PASSED & PROBES VALID\".\n\n### PHASE 2: FINAL OUTPUT\nOnce (and ONLY once) you have a valid python script that has passed the verification loop in the logs:\n\n1.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Task Understanding & Hypothesis Formation for ARC Problem**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. This ARC task presents 2D numpy arrays filled with a few specific colors: Orange (7), Magenta (6), and Red (2). It looks like the Magenta (6) and Red (2) are the key players, with Orange (7) serving as a background. I'm seeing Red shapes, Magenta pixels, and the goal seems to be transforming the input by somehow connecting or extending the Magenta (6) elements based on the position of the Red (2) shapes.\n\nLooking at the examples, specifically Example 1, I see that the Magenta (6) pixels are acting like anchors or seeds, and the Red (2) shapes are somehow influencing how these \"seeds\" grow. It's not a simple flood fill; the Red (2) seems to act as barriers or guides. The Magenta (6) elements expand and connect, but they do so in a specific, predictable way.\n\nInitially, I thought it might be pathfinding or connecting the 6s together, but upon closer look, it's more like these Magenta (6) pixels are 'casting a shadow' based on the location of the Red (2) shapes, either filling rectangles or \"extending\" from Red shapes to Magenta pixels (or the other way around). The goal seems to be to fill the gap between Magenta markers and Red shapes.\n\nThe examples seem to show that there is a concept of alignment or projection. For instance, if a Red shape is vertically aligned or horizontally aligned with a Magenta pixel, the region between that pixel and the Red shape gets filled with magenta.  I'm forming a hypothesis: the Red shapes \"cast\" a shadow, or, the Magenta \"expands\" to meet a Red shape. It looks like the resulting shapes are rectangular blocks of magenta.\n\nI'm starting to zero in on a geometric rule: for each connected component of Red (2), find any corresponding Magenta (6) pixels (or group of pixels). Draw a rectangle using the bounding box of the Red shape and the corresponding Magenta Pixel.\n\nI also observed that the Magenta (6) pixels \"win\" in case of an overlap, meaning the final grid favors the Magenta pixels over the background color.\n\nTo solidify my understanding, I need to look closely at more examples. Using code to parse the coordinates of these 2s and 6s in the input and output, I will visualize the added 6 pixels. I will attempt to confirm my hypothesis by analyzing the rectangle's dimensions and verify the coordinate of the \"new\" 6s.\n\n\n**A Deep Dive into the Emergence of 6s**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a visual puzzle, and the focus is on understanding how those added '6's are appearing. It's like a pathfinding problem, but the rules are hidden. I'm seeing patterns and trying to generalize them to form a strategy.\n\nFirst, I notice that the '6's seem to be associated with '2's, almost as if they are \"outlining\" or \"capping\" them. There are also these initial, strategic '6's, the \"roots\", and vertical lines from those.\n\nI'm thinking, \"Let's zoom in.\" Looking at specific areas, like the top right, I see '2's, initial '6's, and the added '6's interacting. The width difference is confusing, so I check connected components. I'm wondering if there is a fundamental rule at play.\n\nAre these roots a vertical rail that the new '6's interact with? Is there a vertical connection between these groups?\n\nI start to formulate a hypothesis. Is there a \"Vertical Rail\" and \"Horizontal Stops\" that define a new '6'?\n\nI'm starting to visualize a tree-like structure, with the original '6's as the trunk and the new '6's forming branches, connecting to the '2's. Then I'm thinking about bounding boxes: Maybe it's not trees. Maybe it's about drawing a bounding box around all the clusters of 2s?\n\nI'm revisiting the example outputs, focusing on rows directly above and below '2's. There are patterns emerging. The '6's seem to fill above.\n\nAnother hypothesis begins to form. Are the '6's forming some kind of graph structure? Are the vertical trunks connected to everything?\n\nNow I'm envisioning the '6's as paths, and this is where the flood-fill concept enters. I'm checking it against more example outputs, which makes me think of an \"Outline\" strategy.\n\nIt's like a game of Connect-the-Dots, but I have to figure out the rules. I begin thinking about the shapes as horizontal spans. Is it about connecting every horizontal '2' with a \"line\"?\n\nI'm testing another theory: Are the '6's forming a \"Convex Hull\" (the shape created if you stretch a rubber band around a group of pins) around the '2's, guided by those original '6's? This is feeling closer.\n\nI keep trying to develop general rules. Is there a rule about filling gaps between existing 2's? I'm re-analyzing the examples, focusing on the spaces between clusters of 2s. This is leading to a two-step theory: First, Vertical lines. Second, connection.\n\nIt's clear that the '6's extend to the Magenta columns. I'm thinking about \"Nearest Neighbor\" here: for every '2' in a row, extend the path. This leads to the \"vine\" or \"Creeper\" analogy: the '6's \"creep\" along the board.\n\nThe idea is that there is an iterative rule. The \"vine\" logic needs to connect, and the path needs to be one unit wide. But wait, it's not a single path, it can split in two. The roots connect! Is there a connection rule?\n\nI'm thinking about all the rows that have a '2'. These have the most information. I'm calling them key frames. Then there are the transition rows. Is this some kind of shape interpolation? The 6s are a kind of interpolation. This theory, if I implement this, might work!\n\nI'm also wondering if each of these initial roots is a separate tree. And I look at an example to verify the connectivity logic. I'm checking that the shape is solid or disconnected! I'll test for this to determine if the tree analogy works.\n\n\n**Minor Code Hiccup**\n\nRight, I was just working through that image processing script and, *facepalm*, I completely spaced on importing the OpenCV library.  Of course, `cv2` needs to be available for any of that image manipulation code to actually work.  No wonder I was getting those pesky \"name not defined\" errors!  Time to add that import statement and get back on track. A small oversight, easily fixed.\n\n\n**Here's my thought process, distilled:**\n\nI'm tackling this problem as a single, connected structure. The key is understanding how the \"Left\" and \"Right\" trees merge, likely around rows 7 or 8. The overlap at a specific location, the \"6s\" form a \"Network\".\n\nThe problem seems like a walker moving between keyframes, where the \"6s\" create the outlines and paths between roots and \"2s\", starting at initial \"6s\". I can apply a \"Distance Transform\" approach and consider \"2s\" as \"Attractors\", but I need to figure out how to reproduce the rectangle shapes.\n\nI need to outline or hull logic. I have to generate Output Intervals with constraints: Cover \"2s\" and cover roots. This leads to a walker theory.\nI'll define states for the walkers with transitions for rows with/without \"2s\". I'm trying an \"Interpolation between Targets\" approach, but it keeps breaking the \"Single Interval per Row\" theory. I will outline the 2s, like obstacles. I want the 6s as a \"Flow\" from Top to Bottom, and implement a heuristic.\n\nThinking of this as Graph.  I define nodes(roots) and 2-clusters(rectangles). Edges connect 2-clusters. But how do I build the most optimal/minimal graph that connects to all roots?\n\nAnother approach is vertical ray casting, I will look at \"Iterative Expansion\". This involves starting with a grid and looping with a propagation rule.\n\nI could try coding the graph. Start with roots and connected clusters and sort nodes by y. The key is how to connect each cluster to nodes above with specific criteria. Ex 4 tells me there's an outlined rule.\n\nThe problem seems to be the underlap/side-overlap where the roots are.\n\nI will define the \"active_mask\" for each row. I apply expansion and vertical connection with interpolation.  I will separate roots into independent trees, process them and combine the results.\n\nThe key is to determine how to connect the Keyframes.\nMaybe the Tree \"splits\"\n\nI will define a \"Global Vertical Sweep\", with a state activecols set of columsn and with targets. I need to make some tweaks.\n\nI will go with my python prototype:\n- I will implement \"Roots + Clusters -> Graph\" solver, on Ex 1 and Ex 4.\n- I will tweak the parameters (Outline vs Connect) until it matches.\n- For every row with 2s, what is the relation between 2-indices and 6-indices?\n\n\n\n**Analysis and Algorithm for Pixel Propagation**\n\nMy goal is to solve the problem of propagating pixel values (6s) in a grid, given initial positions (6s) and specific \"2\" pixels that influence the propagation. The core idea is to understand the persistence and expansion of pixel values, especially how \"outlines\" of shapes are maintained and transmitted across rows.\n\n**Key Observations and Insights:**\n\n1.  **Outlines persist:** When a shape (represented by \"2\" pixels) ends, its outlines (represented by 6s) continue vertically until they interact with another shape. This is like inertia: shapes keep their \"boundary\" until something changes them.\n\n2.  **\"Fill Gaps and Bounds\" rule:** A core principle: Whenever \"2\" pixels exist in a row, the algorithm should fill any gaps between the 2s and their \"root\" (existing 6s in the row) with 6s. Additionally, the algorithm should add boundary pixels at the minimum-1 and maximum+1 indices of the 2s and any other relevant values. This ensures a consistent shape.\n\n3.  **Keyframes:** Rows with \"2\" pixels are treated as \"keyframe\" rows. They define the \"shape\" that will propagate. These keyframes generate the basic shapes.\n\n4.  **\"Nearest Neighbor Interpolation\"**: The basic algorithm is \"propagate forward, anticipate next keyframes\". Every Keyframe row defines a mask, and the rule will build up the grid to determine all the cells with the value 6. For a current row, use the mask from the last keyframe and then, if the next keyframe is adjacent, Union its mask, resulting in the current mask.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  **Identify Roots**: Find initial \"6\" pixel indices for starting points.\n\n2.  **Keyframe Identification and Mask Generation**: For each row with \"2\" pixels, a mask is built. The mask contains any index which is between the 2 and their root values and has been expanded by 1 on both sides.\n\n3.  **Virtual Keyframes**: Add virtual keyframes at the top and bottom of the grid, representing the root pixels.\n\n4.  **Row Processing**: Iterate through each row and determine the values:\n    a. If the current row is a keyframe, the output should inherit from its mask.\n    b. If the current row is a \"gap\" (no 2s), use the previous keyframe's mask. If the next keyframe is on the next line, include its mask.\n\n**Edge Cases and Refinements**:\n\n*   **Tiebreaker**: If a 2-pixel is equidistant from two roots, it defaults to the pixel value to the left (smallest index).\n\n*   **Keyframe Mask Creation**: If the 2-cluster contains any \"2\" pixels, find the closest root to each 2 and expand it by +1. Union everything in this interval.\n\n*   **Final Output**: Update the grid value in the output array, setting any cell in the mask to 6 as long as it isn't \"2.\"\n\n\n**Final Thoughts and Strategy**\n\nOkay, after some serious troubleshooting and analysis, I think I've cracked this. The core issue was in how I was handling the \"expansion\" or \"outline\" effect around the 2s and the 6s (roots).  I initially thought the `end` index in my slices was the problem. While that was partly true, the real issue was also how the *Keyframes* inherited from each other and how they would anticipate the next.\n\nHere's the refined strategy that I'm confident will work:\n\n1.  **Identify Roots and Keyframes:** First, find all the columns that contain the 6s (roots). Also find the rows that have 2s, those are the Keyframes.\n2.  **Calculate Keyframe Masks:** For each keyframe row that has any \"2\", I calculate a boolean mask. The algorithm examines the connected \"2\" components.  For each, it calculates the *nearest* root and the extent of the Keyframe influence. A component is connected, so I must take all components' boundaries into account.\n3.  **Expansion/Outline:** The Keyframe influence extends from the Root and 2s using `start = min - 1` and `end = max + 2`. (The +2 is crucial to achieve the desired inclusive range in my `slice`). The bounds are clamped to valid image dimensions.\n4.  **Process Rows:** I iterate through the rows from top to bottom.\n    *   **Keyframe Rows:** For Keyframe rows, I use the pre-calculated mask directly. This means Keyframes *don't* inherit from previous rows.\n    *   **Gap Rows (non-Keyframes):** If it's a gap row, I find the nearest preceding and succeeding keyframe. I *do* inherit from the previous keyframe.\n5. **Anticipation**: If the gap row is immediately before a Keyframe row, I \"anticipate\" and use the **Union** (or OR) operation with the next keyframe's mask.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\n*   This approach accurately captures the \"outline\" or expansion caused by the 2s and the closest root. The `start - 1` and `end + 2` is perfect.\n*   By treating Keyframes as \"independent\" I can control their behaviour and avoid strange inheritance.\n*   By inheriting the preceding Row Mask and *Unioning* it with the next Keyframe mask, it smoothly transitions Gaps from Keyframe to Keyframe.\n\nI'm pretty sure this will fix those remaining errors!\n\n\nThe task requires filling areas with the color Magenta (6) based on the interaction between initial Magenta (6) pixels and shapes formed by Red (2) pixels. The Red shapes act as \"targets\" or \"anchors\", and the initial Magenta pixels act as \"roots\" of vertical backbones. The Magenta fill connects the roots to the anchors, forming outlines around the Red shapes and interpolating across empty rows.\n\nThe verified logic operates as follows:\n1.  **Identify Roots**: Find all columns containing initial Magenta (6) pixels. These define the vertical axes of the structure.\n2.  **Keyframe Generation**: Identify all rows containing Red (2) pixels. For each connected component of 2s in a row, find the nearest Root column. Define a horizontal interval that covers both the 2-component and the Root, expanded by 1 pixel on either side (Outline effect). This interval forms the \"Mask\" for that row.\n3.  **Boundary Conditions**: Treat the top (row -1) and bottom (row H) boundaries as virtual keyframes where only the Root columns are active.\n4.  **Interpolation**: Iterate through all rows.\n    *   If a row is a Keyframe (contains 2s), use its computed mask.\n    *   If a row is a Gap (no 2s), it inherits the mask from the nearest *previous* Keyframe.\n    *   **Anticipation**: If a Gap row is immediately adjacent to the *next* Keyframe, it also merges (Unions) the mask of that next Keyframe. This ensures smooth transitions and connectivity between varying shapes.\n5.  **Application**: Apply the mask to the grid, setting pixels to 6 (Magenta) where the mask is active, while strictly preserving existing Red (2) pixels.\n\n### FINAL SOLUTION ###\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    grid = input_grid.copy()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    \n    # Identify Roots (columns with 6s in the input)\n    # We scan all rows, but typically they are at the top or bottom? \n    # The examples show they can be anywhere, but act as vertical backbones.\n    # We collect all unique columns containing 6s.\n    roots = np.unique(np.where(grid == 6)[1])\n    if len(roots) == 0:\n        return grid\n        \n    keyframe_masks = {}\n    \n    # Function to compute the target mask for a row containing 2s\n    def get_row_mask(r):\n        mask = np.zeros(cols, dtype=bool)\n        twos = np.where(grid[r] == 2)[0]\n        if len(twos) == 0:\n            return None\n        \n        # Identify connected components of 2s in this row\n        line = np.zeros(cols, dtype=np.uint8)\n        line[twos] = 1\n        num, labels = cv2.connectedComponents(line.reshape(1, -1), connectivity=8)\n        \n        for l in range(1, num):\n            component_cols = np.where(labels[0] == l)[0]\n            c_min = component_cols.min()\n            c_max = component_cols.max()\n            \n            # Find the nearest Root column to this component\n            best_root = -1\n            min_dist = float('inf')\n            for k in roots:\n                # Calculate distance\n                if c_min <= k <= c_max:\n                    dist = 0\n                else:\n                    dist = min(abs(c_min - k), abs(c_max - k))\n                \n                if dist < min_dist:\n                    min_dist = dist\n                    best_root = k\n            \n            # Define the interval connecting the component to the root\n            # Plus expansion padding (Outline effect)\n            start = min(c_min, best_root) - 1\n            end = max(c_max, best_root) + 2  # +2 because slice is exclusive and we want +1 pixel\n            \n            start = max(0, start)\n            end = min(cols, end)\n            mask[start:end] = True\n            \n        return mask\n\n    # Pre-calculate masks for all Keyframes (rows with 2s)\n    for r in range(rows):\n        m = get_row_mask(r)\n        if m is not None:\n            keyframe_masks[r] = m\n            \n    # Add virtual keyframes for the Roots at the boundaries\n    root_mask = np.zeros(cols, dtype=bool)\n    root_mask[roots] = True\n    keyframe_masks[-1] = root_mask\n    keyframe_masks[rows] = root_mask\n    \n    sorted_keys = sorted(keyframe_masks.keys())\n    out_grid = grid.copy()\n    \n    # Process each row\n    for r in range(rows):\n        if r in keyframe_masks:\n            # If it's a keyframe, use the computed mask directly\n            # This effectively \"Resets\" the shape to the 2s constraint\n            mask = keyframe_masks[r]\n        else:\n            # If it's a gap row, interpolate/propagate\n            # Find nearest keyframes above and below\n            prev_k = [k for k in sorted_keys if k < r][-1]\n            next_k = [k for k in sorted_keys if k > r][0]\n            \n            # Default: Inherit from previous\n            mask = keyframe_masks[prev_k].copy()\n            \n            # Anticipation: If the next keyframe is immediately adjacent,\n            # merge with it to create a connection/morph.\n            if (next_k - r) == 1:\n                mask = mask | keyframe_masks[next_k]\n                \n        # Apply the mask: Write 6s where mask is True, preserving 2s\n        # 2s are \"Obstacles\" but also \"Triggers\", so they are preserved\n        # Existing 6s are naturally preserved or overwritten by 6s\n        # 7s are overwritten\n        # Use boolean indexing\n        target_pixels = mask & (out_grid[r] != 2)\n        out_grid[r, target_pixels] = 6\n                    \n    return out_grid\n```",
