        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the task is to solve an ARC AGI problem in Python. The goal seems to be transforming an input grid to an output grid based on some hidden rules. My first thought is to break down the task. I need to figure out what the input/output pairs are doing to find a function that works.\n\n**Analyzing Example 1 and Observations**\n\nExample 1 is a good starting point. I can see a big grid with a teal background (8), a blue border (1), and some content inside defined by the other colors. The output grid is much smaller, so I'm thinking there's a spatial reduction or some kind of filtering happening.\n\nThe input structure looks like a noisy version of something. My first impression is that there\u2019s an object with some features. It also seems like maybe the background color, the frame color, and the content colors are significant.\n\nI start by tracing coordinates for the objects. Then, I notice the sequence of colored elements (7, 3/4, 6, 9) in the input is preserved. This indicates that it's probably not a simple rotation, but an object extraction. I then start thinking that maybe there is a \"noise\" or a \"mask\" that distorts the input.\n\n**Scaling and Transformations**\n\nNext, I look for scale factors. The input is 22x22, the output is 11x11, which suggests that the image is scaled down by a factor of 2. After checking coordinates, I realize that it\u2019s not just a straightforward scaling.\n\nNow, I start considering fractal or substitution tiling, also considering examples given in other ARC tasks. I then study another example. The outputs aren't directly proportional to the inputs. The example in question is smaller than a 2:1 ratio.\n\n**Deep Dive Into the Data Structure**\n\nI try a completely different approach and try to understand how each block of 2x2 pixels from the input corresponds to the output. I also start noticing some patterns. The goal is the \u201cvalid pixels\u201d. The rows and the columns are \u201cmixed\u201d.\n\nMy attention then goes back to the probe data, to see if I can find some simple cases that would reveal some features. I make the hypothesis that maybe the input is an upscaled or distorted version of the output. I start considering each 2x2 block.\n\n**Exploring Example 2 and Refining Hypotheses**\n\nExample 2 reinforces the idea that it\u2019s a more complex transformation than simple scaling. It has a different size ratio and different colors. It seems that the inputs contain the correct pixels, but there\u2019s noise mixed in.\n\nI explore the idea of removing or correcting noise. I think about extracting each \u201clogical pixel\u201d, but it's not straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something important? Then, I re-examine my scaling factor calculations. It's not as simple as I thought.\n\n**Seeking a Simpler Interpretation**\n\nI try to imagine how the data could be laid out and whether there are just a couple of operations to apply. It starts looking more like a tiling or interleaving problem. The rows seem to be constructed as a repeating pattern.\n\nThe row mapping reveals a relationship between which input rows are used to form the output. It turns out that there are rows in the input that match the content of the output. I then note the columns, and that\u2019s a consistent strategy.\n\n**Interleaving, Noise, and Idealization**\n\nI\u2019m now convinced that the input contains a series of interleaved rows, some with useful information and some with noise. Then, I start working on an interlaced approach. Some of the rows may have been corrupted, but I try to create an idealized version of each pattern.\n\nThe \"corrupted\" pixels are a problem. Maybe the input has been transformed by a noisy transmission. I then hypothesize that maybe I just need to detect the largest, coherent object in the input, and then fill in the holes. Then, I wonder whether the strategy is to apply an algorithm of the type \"Take the mode of a block of 2x2 pixels\u201d.\n\n**Algorithm Refinement and Frame Extraction**\n\nThere might also be a rule or some algorithm, such as \"Isolate the most prominent data\" or a rule of symmetry. I then change my mind and make a new hypothesis. Perhaps, it\u2019s about **\"Crop and clean\"**. This approach seems reasonable.\n\nIt looks like the goal is to capture the area in which the pixels are most relevant and de-noise. I then start working on an approach where the background and the border are identified and the core content isolated.\n\n**Refining the Crop and Clean Strategy**\n\nI start looking at the background and the boundary, making sure that I handle them properly. Then, I start finding some patterns, looking at the periodicity, and trying to reconstruct the\n\nAn ARC AGI task solver in Python.\n\n```python\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ARC task by cropping the grid to the relevant content and cleaning up rows.\n    \n    The logic is:\n    1.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**I need to devise a robust solution for a complex ARC AGI task.**  My initial instinct is to analyze the input-output pairs to understand the underlying transformation.  This involves examining the structure, symmetry, and potential patterns in the input and output grids.\n\n**I hypothesize a folding or overlay operation is likely.**  The dimensions (22x22 input to 11x11 output in example 1) suggest a transformation that reduces the size. The background color plays a critical role, and I must determine how the non-background pixels are related in the input and the output.  I consider dividing the input into quadrants and combining them in some way.\n\n**I'm also considering a holographic model where the input contains multiple 'views' of the output.**  The symmetry within the output grids, and the correspondence between features in the input and output, leads me to believe the output is constructed by selecting pieces of the input.  I need to determine the rule for combining the input data to generate the output, including how to handle rows with partial patterns or \"noise\".\n\n**I then evaluate several alternative approaches.**  I consider an autocorrelation-based approach to find repeating patterns. I believe the solution involves finding the largest symmetric pattern or repeating pattern present in the input and then apply a transformation or a selection process to generate the output.\n\n**I then examine the input-only probe data.**  I try to generalize the approach, and consider various methods, including combining partial patterns by superposition or folding, to account for \"noise\" pixels or symmetric features from multiple rows.\n\n**I then try a symmetry-based approach.**  I look into horizontal or even vertical symmetry. The hypothesis here is that the solution involves reconstructing the object by combining its horizontal parts.\n\n**I explore alternative strategies, including a \"Shift-and-Stack\" strategy.**  I consider that the Input could result from stamping the Output multiple times. This approach might involve deconvolution or identifying an offset pattern.\n\n**I pivot toward a pattern-matching strategy.**  Here, I consider that the Output is the result of selecting and combining the largest symmetric patterns from the Input. I test and refine this hypothesis with the examples and probe data.\n\n**I consider various algorithms.**  I consider finding the background color, identifying potential windows or blocks, computing symmetric patterns, and applying specific rules to make these symmetric.\n\n**In my attempts to devise an algorithm, I notice specific patterns.**  It seems that certain pixels \"inherit\" colors from their neighbors to create a visually coherent pattern. These patterns might involve a voting system, but I need to understand them correctly. I consider a variety of approaches to smooth out or repair input rows, including removing single-pixel elements or vertical neighbors, as well as an algorithm that involves selecting elements in the input rows.\n\n**In the end, I need a solution for a robust code to implement.**  I will focus on extracting a relevant crop from the input and apply horizontal symmetry to each extracted row. To refine this approach, I need to account for noise pixels, which can be \"smoothed\" or \"corrected\" based on neighbor information, and also determine a method to combine the processed rows in order to create a valid output.\n\n\n```python\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ARC task by identifying the main object in the grid, \n    cropping it, and reconstructing it using horizontal symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
