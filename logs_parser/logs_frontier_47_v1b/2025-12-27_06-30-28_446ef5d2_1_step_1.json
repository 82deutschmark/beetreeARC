        "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break down this ARC AGI task.** My thought process starts with a careful analysis of the input/output pairs, specifically looking for patterns in the 2D grid of colors. I immediately zero in on the importance of understanding how these \"patches\" or fragments are reassembled to form the output.  Initially, my mind jumps to a \"jigsaw puzzle\" concept, where we have to translate and potentially rotate pieces to fit them together. This becomes the primary hypothesis.\n\nLooking at the provided examples, I observe that the background color (usually a uniform border) is crucial for identifying the main objects and their fragments. The core of the task is to recognize and stitch together these non-background pixel clusters, with an underlying assumption that they represent parts of a single, coherent image.\n\nA key issue is dealing with \"noise\" colors which appear in the input but not in the output. Based on examples, I consider these as potential \"wildcards\" or 'transparent' elements which may influence matching but don't ultimately form part of the solution image.\n\nTo solve this, I imagine an algorithm. First, I would identify the background color and extract the \"patches\" - which are simply connected regions of non-background pixels. I see that my task is to arrange the \"patches\" appropriately.\n\nNext, I would implement a \"merge\" strategy to combine the patches. I begin with one patch, treating it as a \"canvas\". Then I try to attach the remaining patches to the canvas one by one. I want to shift the new patch across the grid to try and match the overlapping pixels. My goal is to find the best overlap, and then combine the two patches. I repeat this process, adding patches one by one to the existing aggregate, forming larger pieces. If no two patches can be joined, then they are a disconnected component.  I prioritize configurations that produce a single connected output, mirroring the training examples.\n\nDuring the \"merging\" phase, I have a special logic. When I discover a color that acts as a noise- a pixel that should match, but isn't part of the final, solid object, I use this information. If pixels don't match exactly, I check for wildcards: if a pixel in the canvas and a pixel in the new patch are different but one of the two pixels is this wildcard color, I allow the overlap and continue, under the assumption that the value being overwritten by the wildcard color is actually 'transparent' or not-present.\n\nFinally, after stitching these \"patches\" into the final shape, I'll crop the result to the bounding box to produce the output grid, potentially centering it for a tidy visual representation.\n\n\nAn ARC AGI task solver function in Python:\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    # 1.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Current Thought Process for the ARC AGI Task:**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this ARC AGI problem.  I need to write a Python function, `solver(input)`, that can crack these image puzzles. Let's break down Example 1 to see how it works.\n\nI'm seeing a grid with a teal background (color 8).  There are a bunch of \"objects,\" each a cluster of differently colored pixels.  It looks like the key is how these objects are arranged and combined.  I need to figure out the rules of the game.\n\nFor Example 1, I can see a couple of rectangular shapes: one orange block, a combined black and orange block, and a larger orange shape.  My initial reading of the data was wrong, and I need to be more careful.\n\nI realize I need to understand the grid structure and its coordinates, not just the visual shapes.  Printing the widths and parsing the values properly is essential.  The output grid is the same size, with a teal background as well. Now I see one large, structured object formed by the non-background pixels.\n\nIt seems like those non-background pixels in the input are fragments or keys that must be arranged. I then look at \"Input-only training data\" to help.\n\nNow, I'm digging deeper into the pixel data, specifically background versus non-background. I'm noting specific patterns in those input shapes: the orange color 7 seems to act as a border or container.\n\nThen I look at individual connected components of non-background colors. I've noted that color 2 pixels are *vertically* connected and adjacent to orange 7 pixels.\n\nIt's clear I need to isolate the rectangular blocks of pixels. Then I start mapping the rectangular pixel blocks, background color = 8. I notice there are multiple blocks in the Input. I need to list them all:\n- Block 1 (Top Middle) 3 rows, 6 cols.\n- Block 2 (Top Right) 4 rows, 3 cols.\n- Block 3 (Left Side) 7 rows, 5 cols.\n- Block 4 (Bottom Right): Appears to be an irregular shape. But it is messier.\n\nLooking at the output now: The output has one big block: starts at Row 3, Col 7; ends at Row 9, Col 17.  This is a 7x11 block. I'm beginning to see a pattern.\n\nA pattern has formed: The output block looks like a larger rectangle. I'm making note of how many rows and columns each block contains, comparing input blocks and output blocks. The dimensions are coming together now! It's like I'm doing a jigsaw puzzle.  Total size 7*11=77, and I see how each block fits into that area.\n\nI start connecting the pieces: Block 3 and Block 1, from input, form a larger rectangle that matches the width of the output! It looks like a combination of blocks! It must be tiling!\n\nNow I'm looking into the exact pixel composition. I need to compare those individual pixels to verify the shape construction. I compare Output pixels with Input pixels. It's a match!\n\nNow, the top 3 rows of the output seem to be a horizontal combination of Block 3 and Block 1. I start to analyze the edges and corners to identify the logic. Block 3 provides the base, with Block 1 \"tiled\" on top.\n\nI see that the output appears to be the combination of multiple input blocks with their own dimension. The bottom appears to be some kind of horizontal construction. I make more notes.\n\nI need to confirm all shapes in the input image and how they match the image.\n\nIt's clear that the logic in this example is composed of two vertical blocks:\n- Block 3 (Left)\n- Block 1 (Top part)\nAnd two horizontal blocks:\n- Block 2 (Top Right)\n- Block 4 (Bottom Right)\n- The bottom looks like Block 2 then Block 4.\n\nI need a way to decompose those objects.  I'll start by finding all rectangular blocks and how their pixels are structured.  I will then apply the same strategy to other examples to verify if my hypothesis is true.\n\nI see that the output image is formed by assembling the smaller rectangular objects.  Now I will try this logic in Example 2 to verify my hypothesis.\n\nNow, I'm analyzing Example 2.  There's a similar process: background color is 8, and there are other color blocks.  I need to find the rectangular structures in the input.\n\nIt's a more complicated process. There's what I will call \"noise,\" where there's not a rectangular block. \"\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    # Deep copy input grid\n    grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    bg_color = grid[0][0]\n\n    # Preprocessing: Remove noise\n    # Observation: If background is 8, color 4 acts as noise attached to shapes.\n    if bg_color == 8:\n        for r in range(rows):\n            for c in range(cols):\n                if grid[r][c] == 4:\n                    grid[r][c] = bg_color\n\n    # Extract Blocks (Connected Components)\n    visited = set()\n    blocks = []\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] != bg_color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                # BFS to find component\n                stack = [(r, c)]\n                visited.add((r, c))\n                component_pixels = []\n                while stack:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = stack.pop()\n                    component_pixels.append((curr_r, curr_c))\n                    for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n                        nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                            if grid[nr][nc] != bg_color and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                                visited.add((nr, nc))\n                                stack.append((nr, nc))\n                \n                # Determine bounding box\n                min_r = min(p[0] for p in component_pixels)\n                max_r = max(p[0] for p in component_pixels)\n                min_c = min(p[1] for p in component_pixels)\n                max_c = max(p[1] for p in component_pixels)\n                \n                # Extract block pixel data\n                bh = max_r - min_r + 1\n                bw = max_c - min_c + 1\n                block = []\n                for i in range(bh):\n                    block_row = []\n                    for j in range(bw):\n                        block_row.append(grid[min_r + i][min_c + j])\n                    block.append(block_row)\n                blocks.append(block)\n\n    # Determine target shape dimensions for tiling\n    total_area = sum(len(b) * len(b[0]) for b in blocks)\n    candidates = []\n    # Find all factor pairs (H, W) for total_area\n    for h in range(1, int(math.sqrt(total_area)) + 1):\n        if total_area % h == 0:\n            w = total_area // h\n            candidates.append((h, w))\n            if h != w:\n                candidates.append((w, h))\n    \n    # Sort candidates to prioritize square-ish shapes?
