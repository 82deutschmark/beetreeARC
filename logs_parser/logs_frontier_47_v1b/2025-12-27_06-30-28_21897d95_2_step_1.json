        "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, here's my plan for this ARC AGI task.**\n\nI need to create a Python function, `solver(input)`, that, given input/output examples, can predict the correct output for a new, unseen input.  The initial strategy is to analyze a few examples and identify some key geometric and color-based patterns.\n\nInitially, I'm thinking about how the inputs and outputs are structured. They are often a grid of colored pixels. Analyzing a few examples I've noticed:\n\n*   The input seems to be comprised of several rectangular regions, each of a uniform color, sometimes with \"intruders\" (pixels of a different color) inside. These intruders might be important in some way.  The shape and size of each of those regions are also critical.\n*   The output seems to be a rearrangement or transformation of these regions. The output grid seems to be the transpose or rotated version of the input data.  But the colors are often modified.\n\nThe sizes of the input and output grids suggest either a transpose or a 90-degree rotation.  If I look at coordinates, rotation seems likely, and if I look at the order of the pixels, I'm leaning toward rotation.\n\nThen, I'll need to figure out what controls the colors.  It is not a direct color mapping, so it's more complex.  There's definitely a relationship between the original input color of a region and the output color of that same region.  It looks like the colors change, and I might need to consider a color mapping for each example to create some general rules.\n\nI think the key is in these \"intruders.\" I'm going to start calling them \"markers\" - these small, odd-colored pixels in a region that I'll need to somehow relate the color of the output region. My current hypothesis is that the output color of a region is determined by the color of its markers and how they are positioned within that region. Also, the markers will be useful to establish a correlation with what is next to them in the new output. I'm going to spend time working through examples and building this model.\n\nThe next step is to implement this. I'll need a way to decompose the input grid into regions and detect those marker pixels. After that, I'll need the rotation, which should be simple.  Then comes the color prediction. Because the color logic seems tricky, I'm going to implement some heuristics for that. This heuristic might involve the types of interactions between blocks and their markers, and I'll develop it as a function that can determine which output color to use for a region.\n\nI'm starting to think about this in terms of \"neighbor\" regions. I think the rules of color change might look at the nearby blocks and whether the color, or the markers, is consistent or special. I think this rule will need to be written as part of my heuristic.\n\nBecause I can't find a universal rule, I'll build a more complex system that uses neighbors, colors, and markers to see how to predict the output color. I'll construct a graph of these relationships and look for patterns, as my last chance.\n\nFinally, I'll create the `solver(input)` function.\n\n\nAn ARC AGI task solver in Python.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ARC task by identifying rectangular regions in the input grid,\n    rotating the layout 90 degrees counter-clockwise, and determining the \n    new color for each region based on interactions with neighbors and internal markers.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_np.shape\n    \n    # 1.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Solution for ARC AGI Task**\n\nI'm tasked with solving an ARC AGI problem involving transforming input grids to output grids based on a few examples. My initial approach is to analyze the provided examples, focusing on identifying patterns and transformations. I start by meticulously examining the input and output grids, looking for relationships in color composition, block structures, and dimensions.\n\nI've observed the following key points:\n\n*   **Geometric Transformation:** The primary transformation seems to be a -90 degree rotation or transpose, where rows become columns and vice versa. This can be expressed as (row, column) -> (column, H -1 - row).\n*   **Block Decomposition:** Both the input and output grids appear to be composed of rectangular blocks of uniform color.\n*   **Color Mapping:** The core challenge lies in mapping input block colors to output block colors. While the transformation is geometric, the color mapping isn't direct. I suspect the key lies in the \"noise\" pixels, the small, non-dominant color pixels within the blocks. I am working on building a color mapping table based on (Main Color, Noise Colors) in a block to determine the output color.\n\nI'm formulating a feature-based learning approach:\n\n1.  **Block Extraction:** I plan to algorithmically identify rectangular blocks of uniform color in each input grid.\n2.  **Feature Extraction:** For each block, I'll extract these features:\n    *   **Main Color:** The most frequent color in the block.\n    *   **Noise Colors:** A set of all unique non-main colors present in the block.\n    *   **Noise Count:** The number of noise pixels.\n3.  **Mapping:** I am building a mapping (Main Color, NoiseSet) -> OutputColor from all the provided examples.\n4.  **Prediction:** When presented with a new input, I'll extract its blocks, calculate features, and use the learned mapping to determine the output color for each block.\n5.  **Output Construction:** Finally, I'll use the geometric transformation and predicted block colors to construct the complete output grid.\n\nI need to handle edge cases like blocks with equal counts or no noise. I will default to look at colors next to the main color if noise is absent.\n\n\n               Implementation details:\n               - Detect uniform rectangular blocks in Input.\n               - Handle \"Mixed\" blocks by taking most frequent.\n               - If Output region is not uniform, take mode.\n               - For prediction, find best match in training data.\n                 - Exact match on (Main, NoiseSet).\n                 - If not, match on (Main).\n                 - If collision, use NoiseCount or nearest example.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_blocks(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Segment the grid into rectangular blocks of uniform-ish color.\n    We assume the grid is composed of aligned rectangles.\n    Simple recursive splitting or scan-line algorithm.\n    Here we use a heuristic:\n    1.

Based on the analysis of the provided training examples, the transformation involves two main steps:\n\n1.  **Geometric Transformation**: The input grid (dimensions $H \\times W$) is transformed into an output grid (dimensions $W \\times H$). The layout corresponds to a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of the blocks' positions. Specifically, a block at input columns $x_1$ to $x_2$ and rows $y_1$ to $y_2$ maps to an output block at rows $(W - x_2)$ to $(W - x_1)$ and columns $y_1$ to $y_2$. This effectively maps input columns to output rows (inverted order) and input rows to output columns.\n\n2.  **Color Transformation**: The color of each block in the output is determined by the content of the corresponding block in the input. The input blocks often contain a \"Main Color\" (the background) and \"Noise Colors\" (pixels of different colors scattered within). The mapping from `(Main Color, Noise Colors)` to `Output Color` is learned from the examples.\n\nHere is the code for the `solver` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef get_blocks(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    # Identify boundaries based on color changes\n    row_breaks = {0, rows}\n    for r in range(1, rows):\n        row1 = grid[r-1]\n        row2 = grid[r]\n        diffs = sum(1 for x, y in zip(row1, row2) if x != y)\n        if diffs > cols * 0.3:\n             row_breaks.add(r)\n             \n    col_breaks = {0, cols}\n    for c in range(1, cols):\n        col1 = [grid[r][c-1] for r in range(rows)]\n        col2 = [grid[r][c] for r in range(rows)]\n        diffs = sum(1 for x, y in zip(col1, col2) if x != y)\n        if diffs > rows * 0.3:\n            col_breaks.add(c)\n            \n    r_sorted = sorted(list(row_breaks))\n    c_sorted = sorted(list(col_breaks))\n    \n    extracted = []\n    for i in range(len(r_sorted)-1):\n        for j in range(len(c_sorted)-1):\n            r0, r1 = r_sorted[i], r_sorted[i+1]\n            c0, c1 = c_sorted[j], c_sorted[j+1]\n            \n            subgrid = [row[c0:c1] for row in grid[r0:r1]]\n            flat = [x for row in subgrid for x in row]\n            if not flat: continue\n            \n            counts = Counter(flat)\n            main_color = counts.most_common(1)[0][0]\n            noise_colors = tuple(sorted([k for k in counts if k != main_color]))\n            \n            extracted.append({\n                'rect': (r0, c0, r1-r0, c1-c0),\n                'main': main_color,\n                'noise': noise_colors,\n                'count': len(flat),\n                'width': c1-c0\n            })\n            \n    return extracted\n\ndef solve_block(block, kb):\n    main = block['main']\n    noise = block['noise']\n    width = block['width']\n\n    # 1.
