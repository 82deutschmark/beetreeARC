PROTOCOL ***\n\nYou are an expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect equipped with a **python tool**.\nYour goal is to write a final, robust `solver(input_grid)` function.\nThe `input_grid` provided to `solver` will be a **2D NumPy array**.\nYou are provided with **Solved Training Pairs** (to derive the rule) and **Unlabeled Probe Inputs** (to test generalizability).\n\n**CRITICAL RULE:** Do NOT guess. Do NOT rely on visual intuition alone. You must PROVE your solution works using the tool.\n\n### PHASE 1: EXPERIMENTATION (Mandatory Tool Usage)\nBefore answering, you must use the python tool to perform this cycle:\n\n1.  **Load Data**: The python environment starts empty. Write a script to define:\n    *   `train_inputs` and `train_outputs` (from the Solved Examples, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n    *   `probe_inputs` (from the Input-Only Data, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n\n2.  **Analyze**: Use numpy and cv2 to inspect ALL grids (training + probes). \n    *   *Check the Probes*: Do they have different sizes? Do they introduce new colors? \n    *   Ensure your rule does not rely on assumptions that the Probes violate.\n\n3.  **Prototype & Verify (The Loop)**:\n    *   Draft a candidate `solver` function inside the tool.\n    *   **Test 1 (Accuracy)**: Run the function on ALL `train_inputs` and assert that the result matches `train_outputs` EXACTLY.\n    *   **Test 2 (Generalization)**: Run the function on ALL `probe_inputs`. \n        *   Since you don't have the answers, you cannot check accuracy. \n        *   INSTEAD, CHECK FOR CRASHES. Ensure the function runs without error (e.g., no `IndexError`, `ValueError`) and returns a valid grid.\n    *   **Refine**: If any test fails, use `print()` to see the error/diff, rewrite the function, and run the cycle again.\n    *   Repeat until your python script prints \"ALL TRAINING PASSED & PROBES VALID\".\n\n### PHASE 2: FINAL OUTPUT\nOnce (and ONLY once) you have a valid python script that has passed the verification loop in the logs:\n\n1.  Output the final, standalone `solver(input_grid)` function.\n2.  The code must be self-contained (import numpy as np, cv2 inside).\n3.  **Do not include the test harness or data loading** in the final block. Just the solver function.\n4.  **CRITICAL**: You MUST copy your verified solver into a final block preceded by exactly this label: `### FINAL SOLUTION ###`\n5.  Your response must conclude with this final block. Do not end with tool output or partial analysis.\n\nFormat:\n### FINAL SOLUTION ###\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    # input_grid is a 2D numpy array\n    # ...\n```",

PROTOCOL ***\n\nYou are an expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect equipped with a **python tool**.\nYour goal is to write a final, robust `solver(input_grid)` function.\nThe `input_grid` provided to `solver` will be a **2D NumPy array**.\nYou are provided with **Solved Training Pairs** (to derive the rule) and **Unlabeled Probe Inputs** (to test generalizability).\n\n**CRITICAL RULE:** Do NOT guess. Do NOT rely on visual intuition alone. You must PROVE your solution works using the tool.\n\n### PHASE 1: EXPERIMENTATION (Mandatory Tool Usage)\nBefore answering, you must use the python tool to perform this cycle:\n\n1.  **Load Data**: The python environment starts empty. Write a script to define:\n    *   `train_inputs` and `train_outputs` (from the Solved Examples, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n    *   `probe_inputs` (from the Input-Only Data, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n\n2.  **Analyze**: Use numpy and cv2 to inspect ALL grids (training + probes). \n    *   *Check the Probes*: Do they have different sizes? Do they introduce new colors? \n    *   Ensure your rule does not rely on assumptions that the Probes violate.\n\n3.  **Prototype & Verify (The Loop)**:\n    *   Draft a candidate `solver` function inside the tool.\n    *   **Test 1 (Accuracy)**: Run the function on ALL `train_inputs` and assert that the result matches `train_outputs` EXACTLY.\n    *   **Test 2 (Generalization)**: Run the function on ALL `probe_inputs`. \n        *   Since you don't have the answers, you cannot check accuracy. \n        *   INSTEAD, CHECK FOR CRASHES. Ensure the function runs without error (e.g., no `IndexError`, `ValueError`) and returns a valid grid.\n    *   **Refine**: If any test fails, use `print()` to see the error/diff, rewrite the function, and run the cycle again.\n    *   Repeat until your python script prints \"ALL TRAINING PASSED & PROBES VALID\".\n\n### PHASE 2: FINAL OUTPUT\nOnce (and ONLY once) you have a valid python script that has passed the verification loop in the logs:\n\n1.  Output the final, standalone `solver(input_grid)` function.\n2.  The code must be self-contained (import numpy as np, cv2 inside).\n3.  **Do not include the test harness or data loading** in the final block. Just the solver function.\n4.  **CRITICAL**: You MUST copy your verified solver into a final block preceded by exactly this label: `### FINAL SOLUTION ###`\n5.  Your response must conclude with this final block. Do not end with tool output or partial analysis.\n\nFormat:\n### FINAL SOLUTION ###\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    # input_grid is a 2D numpy array\n    # ...\n```",

PROTOCOL ***\n\nYou are an expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect equipped with a **python tool**.\nYour goal is to write a final, robust `solver(input_grid)` function.\nThe `input_grid` provided to `solver` will be a **2D NumPy array**.\nYou are provided with **Solved Training Pairs** (to derive the rule) and **Unlabeled Probe Inputs** (to test generalizability).\n\n**CRITICAL RULE:** Do NOT guess. Do NOT rely on visual intuition alone. You must PROVE your solution works using the tool.\n\n### PHASE 1: EXPERIMENTATION (Mandatory Tool Usage)\nBefore answering, you must use the python tool to perform this cycle:\n\n1.  **Load Data**: The python environment starts empty. Write a script to define:\n    *   `train_inputs` and `train_outputs` (from the Solved Examples, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n    *   `probe_inputs` (from the Input-Only Data, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n\n2.  **Analyze**: Use numpy and cv2 to inspect ALL grids (training + probes). \n    *   *Check the Probes*: Do they have different sizes? Do they introduce new colors? \n    *   Ensure your rule does not rely on assumptions that the Probes violate.\n\n3.  **Prototype & Verify (The Loop)**:\n    *   Draft a candidate `solver` function inside the tool.\n    *   **Test 1 (Accuracy)**: Run the function on ALL `train_inputs` and assert that the result matches `train_outputs` EXACTLY.\n    *   **Test 2 (Generalization)**: Run the function on ALL `probe_inputs`. \n        *   Since you don't have the answers, you cannot check accuracy. \n        *   INSTEAD, CHECK FOR CRASHES. Ensure the function runs without error (e.g., no `IndexError`, `ValueError`) and returns a valid grid.\n    *   **Refine**: If any test fails, use `print()` to see the error/diff, rewrite the function, and run the cycle again.\n    *   Repeat until your python script prints \"ALL TRAINING PASSED & PROBES VALID\".\n\n### PHASE 2: FINAL OUTPUT\nOnce (and ONLY once) you have a valid python script that has passed the verification loop in the logs:\n\n1.  Output the final, standalone `solver(input_grid)` function.\n2.  The code must be self-contained (import numpy as np, cv2 inside).\n3.  **Do not include the test harness or data loading** in the final block. Just the solver function.\n4.  **CRITICAL**: You MUST copy your verified solver into a final block preceded by exactly this label: `### FINAL SOLUTION ###`\n5.  Your response must conclude with this final block. Do not end with tool output or partial analysis.\n\nFormat:\n### FINAL SOLUTION ###\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    # input_grid is a 2D numpy array\n    # ...\n```",

PROTOCOL ***\n\nYou are an expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect equipped with a **python tool**.\nYour goal is to write a final, robust `solver(input_grid)` function.\nThe `input_grid` provided to `solver` will be a **2D NumPy array**.\nYou are provided with **Solved Training Pairs** (to derive the rule) and **Unlabeled Probe Inputs** (to test generalizability).\n\n**CRITICAL RULE:** Do NOT guess. Do NOT rely on visual intuition alone. You must PROVE your solution works using the tool.\n\n### PHASE 1: EXPERIMENTATION (Mandatory Tool Usage)\nBefore answering, you must use the python tool to perform this cycle:\n\n1.  **Load Data**: The python environment starts empty. Write a script to define:\n    *   `train_inputs` and `train_outputs` (from the Solved Examples, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n    *   `probe_inputs` (from the Input-Only Data, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n\n2.  **Analyze**: Use numpy and cv2 to inspect ALL grids (training + probes). \n    *   *Check the Probes*: Do they have different sizes?

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Getting Started on this ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to tackle this ARC problem, and they've given me some examples to work with. My initial plan is to dive right in.\n\nFirst things first: I'm going to load up all the provided input and output grids into the Python environment. I need access to the solved examples so I can try and discern the underlying rule. Then, I'll load the input-only 'probe' grids, which I assume are just there to test the solution once I have one.\n\nNow for the analysis. The input grids are pretty large, around 30x30, while the output grids are much smaller, sizes like 9x4, 4x5, 3x7, and 4x4. That's a huge clue right there - it's highly likely this task involves *extraction* or some form of *summarization* of the input.\n\nTo get a better picture, I'm going to visualize these grids. Printing sections or checking the shapes will help me pinpoint any obvious patterns. In extraction tasks like this, I know to look for things like:\n\n*   A specific subgrid being extracted (maybe defined by a border or a certain color)\n*   Counting the number of certain colors\n*   Repeating patterns\n*   Cropping a specific region of the input\n\nNow, looking specifically at the first example, I see an input grid size of (30,30) and an output size of (9,4).  It seems there is some noise in this example. I suspect a region of interest. I'm going to dig into the pixel values. The next step is to run the Python code that loads the data and inspect that first example.\n\nSo, the 'probe' inputs... they are used for validation. I'll need a mapping from the larger (30,30) to each of the relevant outputs.\n\nOkay, let's fire up this Python script and get to work.\n\n\n**Thinking Through This Puzzle**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at these 30x30 inputs, and the outputs are significantly smaller. Interesting. It's also immediately clear that the output's unique values are just a subset of the input's. And there's this value, '8', in the input that's nowhere to be seen in the output. Hmm, that's definitely a clue. I'm starting to think '8' might be some kind of delimiter or just noise.\n\nMy next step is to get a handle on where these '8's are appearing in the inputs. Let's visualize that. I'm going to print out their coordinates for each example. Then I can see if the output is just a sub-grid of the input. Maybe it's embedded within the larger input data, but hidden by this value '8' or some other noise or occluding color.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by looking at regions defined by the value '8'. \n\nLet's start by plotting the positions of the '8's and see where that takes us.\n\n\n**Initial Observation & Hypothesis Formation**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My initial hunch is that these \"8\" blocks are key, and their bounding box dimensions are directly linked to the output grid size. That's immediately apparent across all examples. The 8s seem to be masking something, and the output is revealing that \"something.\"  Since the 8s are uniform, the *information* can't be contained within them directly; it must lie elsewhere. My primary hypothesis is that the output grid is derived from a repeating pattern within the input, and the 8s simply highlight a specific crop or window into that pattern. This suggests some form of translational symmetry or periodicity in the input grid.\n\n**Refinement of Approach**\n\nThe output looks like what *should* be there if the 8s weren't obscuring it. This solidifies the idea of periodicity. My goal is to determine this periodic structure. My initial thought is to find a translation vector and apply it to fill in the missing region.\n\nTo test this, I'll analyze the input grids, looking for a repeating block or pattern.  I'll compare the output to the input. If the output appears elsewhere in the input, ignoring the 8s, then we're on the right track. I'll search for the output in the input, excluding the 8s to test this idea.\n\n**Operationalizing the Strategy**\n\nLet's define the region of interest (ROI) as the bounding box of the 8s, and let the `mask` be where the input value equals 8.  My goal is to fill in `input[mask]` based on the pattern present in `input[~mask]` (the rest of the grid). I want to find a translation vector, if it exists, such that `input[p]` equals `input[p + v]`. Or I may look for small tiles, or a repeating large pattern.\n\n**Execution & Verification**\n\nTo refine, I'll visualize Example 1's input (excluding the 8s) alongside the output. I'm going to search for the output 9x4 pattern within the input. If this pattern exists elsewhere in the input, then it becomes a straightforward copy operation. If it's a partial match, it might confirm a tiling pattern. This search will be the key test of my periodicity hypothesis, so I'll prioritize running this test on the first example.  This is a critical step to validate that translational symmetry exists.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Grid's Pattern**\n\nAlright, I'm looking at this grid and it's clear the solution isn't a simple copy-paste job. That \"8s\" region is messing things up, so I need to think about periodicity.  Since it's likely periodic but the output isn't a simple block, I'll need to account for it potentially spanning boundaries or misaligning.\n\nMy approach is to assume the grid is built from a repeating \"tile\" T, represented as `Tiled[y, x]`. The \"8s\" are overwriting parts of this `Tiled` structure, so my task is to reconstruct the original pixel values. To do that, the key is to determine the period `(py, px)` of this tiling.\n\nOnce I have the period, for any pixel within the \"8s\" region, I can look at a corresponding pixel outside the region using the offsets `(y - k*py, x - m*px)` to reveal the correct pixel value.\n\nFinding the period is the crux. I'll test various `(py, px)` values, starting from (1,1) up to some reasonable limit, like (15,15). For each candidate period, I'll compare the original grid to a shifted version. I'll only compare pixels that aren't \"8s\". The smallest period that gives no mismatches is probably the right one. I need to be careful; the tiling could be horizontal, vertical, or both, and it might have an offset. But considering it's a 30x30 grid, simple rectangular tiling seems most likely.\n\nI'll write a function to detect this periodicity. I'll iterate through all possible `py` and `px` and, for each pair, calculate the number of mismatches between the original grid and the shifted one. The best period will have zero mismatches. I'll need to choose the smallest such period, or the one that best explains the data.\n\nActually, it's possible that the vertical and horizontal periods are independent. I can check for vertical periodicity `py` such that `grid[y, x] == grid[y+py, x]`, and horizontal periodicity `px` such that `grid[y, x] == grid[y, x+px]`.\n\nSo, the plan is to implement a period finder. Let's get to it.\n\n\n**Diving Deep into the Grid's Structure**\n\nOkay, so the simple periodicity check failed, meaning the grid isn't just a basic repetition along the axes. That tells me the pattern is more complex than a straightforward rectangular tile. Looking back at Example 1, that initial sequence... it's a bit of a mess at first glance, but those pairs, like 3,3; 6,6; and 9,9, are intriguing. And the output of Example 1, it's something to keep in mind, right?\n\nThe \"copy from another location\" hypothesis is still valid, but the periodicity isn't perfect. It could be a larger tile, some kind of symmetry, or maybe a shift is involved, like `grid[y, x] == grid[y+1, x+3]`. The key is to find that shift that works.\n\nThis calls for a more general approach, an autocorrelation. I need to find shifts `(dy, dx)` where the grid aligns with itself, essentially ignoring the missing 8s. A shift with a high number of matching pixels and no mismatches is what I'm after. Once I find this shift, I can use it to fill in the missing 8s. If `grid[y, x]` is an 8, I can look at `grid[y-dy, x-dx]` or `grid[y+dy, x+dx]` to infer the value if it's not an 8.\n\nI'll need to compute the validity of all shifts within a reasonable range, say, from -H to H for both `dy` and `dx`. A valid shift requires that for all overlapping pixels (excluding the 8s), the values match. Since I need to fill the whole 8 region, I might need multiple shifts or a chain of shifts, but ideally, one good shift will suffice.\n\nThe algorithm is clear: \n1. Identify target pixels (where the input is 8). \n2. Find a \"source\" vector `(dy, dx)` such that the non-8 pixels align when shifted. I need a valid shift, and that it has to be helpful in filling the 8s.\n\nTime to implement this as a script. I'll search for `dy` and `dx` within a reasonable range, maybe [-29, 29]. Since the grid is usually 30x30, brute force is fine. I'll need to use numpy or cv2 to speed things up, or just be careful. For each example, I will list the top valid vectors, sorted by matching pixels, and see if I can predict the entire 8 region using them. Actually, I will just go with any vector that has 0 mismatches with high matches.\n\nAh, wait. The previous code only checked shifts along the axes; `check_periodicity` would have missed a diagonal vector if it failed. I need to check all `(dy, dx)` combinations. This is a crucial oversight. I should also consider reflections, though translation is more typical in these problems.\n\nOkay, let's update the tool to check all potential `(dy, dx)` shifts. I think this will get me where I need to be.\n\n\n**Digging Deeper: Beyond the Obvious**\n\nOkay, so those initial \"shifts\" are looking like complete garbage.  A -28 shift with only 4 supporting pixels?  Come on.  They're just grabbing at the corners, probably.  No discernible global pattern emerges.  So, if it's *not* a simple periodic structure, what else could be going on here?\n\nMy mind immediately jumps to alternative possibilities.  Let's see...  If it's not a grid translation, how can I even begin to understand what's hidden under those 8s? I'm thinking:\n\n1.  **Symmetry**: Could the grid itself be mirrored horizontally, vertically, or diagonally?  That seems like a reasonable thing to check.\n2.  **Logic**: Is there some underlying rule?  Like a Sudoku-like constraint or a very specific color pattern?\n3.  **Local Context**: Does the information around the 8s tell us something about what's inside?\n4.  **Copy**: Might parts of the pattern be *copied* and perhaps *rotated* or *flipped* somewhere else in the grid?  That's a clever trick I should explore.\n\nRight, so, I'm going to start with a check for **Global Symmetry**.  That's the easiest thing to implement and could be fruitful. I'll compare the original grid to its horizontally flipped, vertically flipped, and 90-degree rotated versions. I'll need to ignore the 8s when looking for mismatches, of course.\n\nOh, and these inputs, they seem kind of noisy.  It makes me think about the overall distribution of values in each row and column. Could this grid be composed of four quadrants that are related to each other in some clever way? I'll investigate that.\n\nI'm now going to apply these symmetry checks to Example 1, just to see what pops up.\n\n\n**Deconstructing the Grid: A Journey Through Symmetry and Tiling**\n\nAlright, no luck with perfect symmetries so far. Time to zoom out and reassess. Since I can't visualize the images directly, I'll have to rely on generating and analyzing sub-regions. My first thought is: could this grid be built from *repeating blocks* of size `(h, w)` that tile the entire image? Earlier, I was looking for pixel-perfect shifts, but what if these tiles are rotated, flipped, or interwoven in some clever way?\n\nLet's dive back into the Example 1 output: `[[9, 9, 6, 4], [2, 6, 9, 4], ...]` and connect it to the corresponding part of the input near the 8s. The 8s in Example 1, specifically those at `y[14:23], x[25:29]`, look like they're a 9x4 block. Hmm, this is a 30x30 grid. The center is at (15, 15), and this 8-block is on the right-hand side, vertically centered or so. Could a symmetrically equivalent block lie on the left side? Let me investigate `y[14:23], x[0:4]` or `x[1:5]` to see if they hold the key. I should also check if the regions, `grid[14:23, 0:4]` or `grid[14:23, 1:5]`, actually match the output.\n\nGoing back to the start, I need to scan the whole input for the output block. But this time, I won't just look for a pixel-perfect match. Let's incorporate rotations and reflections into the check. I was overlooking something fundamental. Could the grid be folded? Or tiled?\n\nThinking about tiles: If it's a 2x2 tiling pattern, each tile would be 15x15. So, would `grid[0:15, 0:15]` be equal to `grid[0:15, 15:30]`, and so on, *maybe* ignoring the 8s since those seem like \"holes\"? If the grid is indeed 30x30, perhaps it's 2x2 tiles of 15x15, or maybe 3x3 tiles of 10x10, or even 5x5 tiles of 6x6.\n\nHere's the new plan: I'll test for tiling with dimensions `(H_tile, W_tile)`. The entire grid would be composed of this exact tile. For Example 1 (30x30), possible divisors are 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15. Let's start with 15x15. I'll test if Quadrant 1 equals Quadrant 2 equals Quadrant 3 equals Quadrant 4 (again, disregarding those troublesome 8s). If they are equivalent (under translation/rotation etc.), I can fill those 8s using data from the other quadrants.\n\nTime to script this check and see what emerges.\n\n\n**Initial Frustration and Hypothesis Generation**\n\nOkay, this is getting complex. My initial tiling approach failed, so I need a new angle. This isn't a simple transformation \u2013 no direct translation, reflection, or straightforward pattern emerges. I'm going to reframe the problem: \"What precisely fills that 'hole' marked as 8?\"  Is the hole defining a specific structure? I need to analyze how the grid is constructed. Are there underlying **lines**, **rays**, or maybe even a **scrambled** structure I'm missing?\n\n**Considering Periodicity and Autocorrelation**\n\nLet me check if there's any kind of **offset** or periodicity, like a brick-laying pattern. Maybe row `i` is the same as row `i+k`, but with a horizontal shift. My previous analysis using **autocorrelation** was fruitless, which means there's no simple periodicity. But the input data *is* structured.  \n\n**Color Analysis and Zooming in**\n\nNow, I'm going to look closely at the **colors** themselves. We have colors 1-7 and 9, with 8 as the hole. Is there an inherent numerical pattern, like a sequence? I'll examine a \"clean\" patch from Example 1. Seeing repetitions like `3,3`, `6,6`, and `9,9`. Does each number, maybe, represent a block of 1x2 or 2x1 pixels? Or, is this grid somehow upscaled? Perhaps it's zoomed in 2x: if so, the pixel at `(r, c)` should equal `(r+1, c)` and `(r, c+1)`. I see in Example 1 that `3,3` and `6,6` suggest horizontal doubling. But the `3, 5` is not doubled. Not a global zoom.\n\n**Focusing on the Output**\n\nLet's switch to analyzing the **Output** grids. Example 1 shows `9 9` in row 0. We see pairs `9 9`, columns are `9, 2, 2, 9...`.\n\n**Visualizing the Grid with Text**\n\nI'm going to use the Python interpreter and create a text-based representation of these grids, replacing '8' with spaces. My human pattern recognition will be better with this visualization.  I'll inspect Example 1 and 2 this way.\n\n\n**Diving Deep into the Symmetry of the Grid**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this grid and immediately the missing section, the \"hole\", jumps out. My first thought is to see if there's horizontal symmetry \u2013 is the left side a mirror of the right? Example 1 seems to hint at it, especially when comparing the beginning of the line (`99446`) with the space and ending digit (`4`).  The hole is clearly 4 characters wide, matching the space and the final digit.\n\nThen I shifted to looking at the columns. The missing columns are 25-28, implying a potential symmetry around column 14.5. I quickly ruled out simple vertical mirroring by checking row elements against their counterparts across the center.  No dice.\n\nNext, I thought of palindromes. Looking at Example 1 again, I checked the first and last lines, thinking perhaps the first half was a reverse of the second.  Close, but not a perfect palindrome.\n\nBack to the output of Example 1: `9 9 6 4`. The missing part of the line seems to directly correspond to this output. And since the missing space is four characters wide, the line is completed by appending the output before the ending '4'.\n\nNow, here's where it got interesting.  I realized that, with the output inserted, the complete line *did* look like a palindrome! The beginning `99446` seemed to mirror the end, `446`.  This \"Palindrome Hypothesis\" got me excited.\n\nBut, I needed to verify.  I quickly checked other rows, and nope, not a palindrome across the whole row.  Then, maybe a vertical palindrome? Nope, the opposite row is not the same. Rotation? Nope, that didn't pan out either.\n\nI had previously coded something to check for rotational symmetry (180 degrees) with `rot180` in `check_symmetries`. I realized I'd missed the output of the mismatch count because of a \"PERFECT\" filter. I'm going back to check those actual numbers.\n\nExample 2 is another data point. The hole is between columns 21 and 26, which makes me think of nested rectangles or rotational symmetry around the center.\nThe output is `3 1 4 4 4`.\nAlso, that the start of the row, `32997`, doesn't match the reverse of the end of the row, `9975`.\n\nMy thinking now is to broaden the search. Maybe the symmetry is within quadrants of the grid, or perhaps the grid is composed of a system of nested squares. Perhaps it's point symmetry around the center? Time to re-run the symmetry checks and get some mismatch counts.\n\n\n**The Power of Symmetry: Transpose and Diagonal Magic**\n\nOkay, so I've been digging into this, and the **transpose** symmetry is really popping out. The data is screaming at me that this is the key. Those example matches \u2013 58.45%, 56.05%, 61.54%, and especially 67.28% \u2013 they're pointing toward a strong signal.\n\nTranspose, or `grid[r, c] == grid[c, r]`, means the grid is essentially mirroring itself across the main diagonal. This feels like it could be a game-changer. I need to understand if the mismatches are just random noise, or if there's a pattern within the 'noise'. If it's a \"perfectly symmetric with noise\" scenario, I can *use* that symmetry to fill in the gaps!\n\nThe hole is at `(y, x)`? Then I check `(x, y)`. If that's a valid value, I can just copy it over to the hole.\n\nSo, let's test this **Diagonal Symmetry** theory. For every pixel in the Output where `grid[y, x]` is 8, I'll predict `grid[x, y]`. If that's also an 8, I'm stuck. But usually, the hole isn't *on* the diagonal, or if it is, the problem is small.\n\nI'm getting this idea of reconstructing the training outputs using Transpose. Where `pred[r, c] = input[global_x, global_y]` when `input[global_y, global_x]` is an 8.\n\nI see `flip_diag` has the same score. Huh, `flip_diag` is a rotation of `flip_lr`, right? It's basically the anti-diagonal: `grid[r, c] == grid[W-1-c, H-1-r]`. Hang on a second, I can access transpose as `grid.T`. And my code defines `flip_diag` as `rot90(fliplr(grid))`. Let me think this through... `fliplr` maps `(r, c)` to `(r, W-1-c)`. Then `rot90` maps that to `(c, H-1-r)`.\n\nForget that, I should stick with just `transpose` for now. I need to apply the Transpose reconstruction and see how the accuracy looks.\n\n\n**My Analysis of the Symmetry Reconstruction**\n\nOkay, so I've been running through these examples and it looks like Example 1 is a slam dunk with the Transpose symmetry \u2013 that's spot on. Example 4 is pretty decent, only two mismatches. But Examples 2 and 3? They're completely off-base, unfortunately. \n\nTime to look at the next best candidate: the Anti-Diagonal. That's essentially flipping the image across the diagonal running from the top right to the bottom left.  I've got the mapping figured out: `grid[r, c] == grid[W-1-c, H-1-r]`, assuming a square grid, of course. \n\nLet me just double-check that index mapping logic...  If the grid is 30x30 (H=W=30), (0,0) maps to (29, 29).  (0, 29) maps to (0, 29).  (29, 0) maps to (29, 0). Yup, that checks out perfectly. \n\nAlright, with the indexing confirmed, let's get to testing this Anti-Diagonal reconstruction. I need to make sure this symmetry is working as expected.\n\n\n**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**\n\nOkay, so Transpose is looking like the frontrunner, nailing Example 1 almost perfectly and getting close on Example 4. But why are Examples 2 and 3 struggling? They've got to have a different symmetry at play. Let me re-evaluate the individual symmetry scores again, just to be sure... Hmm, the scores aren't exactly stellar \u2013 around 60% match, which implies substantial noise. The fact that Example 1 is perfect suggests the noise is structured and doesn't affect the region of interest. But for Ex 2 and 3, something's off.\n\n**Detailed Analysis of Example 2's Failures**\n\nLet's zero in on Example 2. Comparing the prediction with the true values, the left side is spot-on! Columns 0, 1, and 2 match perfectly, but columns 3 and 4 are diverging. It's like the symmetry works for a part but not the whole thing, or maybe the symmetry axis is shifted or we need to combine Transpose with something else? The differences look like color swaps, maybe related to source and target regions, so let's check those regions. The source region (which Transpose used) looks okay. So, maybe it's block-wise symmetry?\n\n**Emerging Hypothesis: Localized Pattern Completion**\n\nHold on, looking at Example 4, the issue is just the first row, suggesting a more localized, \"Denoising\" approach may be required. What if there are multiple symmetries, or we need to find the \"best\" patch based on boundary conditions? This is where pattern completion or in-painting might come in. The \"8s\" form a hole, and the boundary of that hole provides the crucial clues. I think we need to search the grid for a patch that matches the *boundary* of the hole. If we can find that, we can fill the hole with that matching patch's content.\n\n**Algorithm Design: Context Matching**\n\nHere's my proposed algorithm:\n\n1.  **Define the hole mask.**\n2.  **Define a \"context\" mask** (e.g., a one-pixel border around the hole).\n3.  **Extract the pixel values** of the context from the input.\n4.  **Slide a window** over the entire grid, searching for a patch that matches the combined \"hole plus context\" size.\n5.  **Calculate the distance** between the context pixels and the candidate patch's context pixels (mismatches).\n6.  **Find the best-matching patch** based on the lowest context mismatch.\n7.  **Fill the hole** with the center of that best patch.\n\nThis approach handles translation, and if the grid is periodic or tiled, it should find the period. Also, since Transpose was strong initially, we can search *transformed* grids (like Transpose, Rotate 90, etc.) too.\n\n**Implementation Details**\n\nLet's implement this \"Context Matching\" approach. What should the context size be? A one or two-pixel border? The hole could be at the edge, so we need to handle those bounds. For Example 1, the hole is 9x4, and we'd search for a 9x4 block with a context ring. But if the hole is unique, we may not find an exact match for the whole border, but matches for parts might suffice. Let's start by searching for the *entire* context first. If that fails, we can relax the context later. I will search in the original input, the transposed input, and other transformations.\n\nI need a function `find_best_patch(grid, hole_mask, search_grids)`, where search_grids is a list of grids to search in. Minimize context mismatch! Context definition: expand the bounding box by one pixel. The pixels in this bounding box that are *not* the 8s form the \"template.\" The rest is the hole. We want the candidate patch's context pixels to match the template, and the pixels within the candidate's \"hole\" area to be valid (not 8). Let's give this a shot.\n\n\n**Successful Hole-Filling and a Deep Dive into Shape Validation**\n\nOkay, this is fantastic! The \"Context Matching\" method absolutely nailed all four training examples. It found the perfect patch in the transformed input to exactly fill each hole.\n\nLet's quickly recap the methodology: First, identify the bounding box of the missing area. Expand it by one pixel for context. Then, exhaustively search through all eight geometric symmetries (identity, transpose, rotations, flips) for a matching patch.  Two conditions must be met: the candidate patch can't overlap with existing filled regions (8s in this case), and it must perfectly (or maximally) match the context surrounding the hole. Finally, just copy the data over.  Elegant and robust! Handles translation and all standard geometric transformations.\n\nNow for a probe check.  Probe 1 solved without a hitch! The output shape is (9, 3). However, I need to verify that this shape is correct based on the input. Earlier, the code reported the hole as (9, 3).  Let's double-check. The code found 27 '8's, with the bounding box `y[14:23], x[0:3]`.  14 to 23 should be 10 rows, right?  23 - 14 + 1 = 10.  Okay, that makes sense.\n\nBut wait. Earlier output had a shape of (9, 4)! I need to clarify why there is a discrepancy.  For Example 1, the code found 36 '8's and the bounding box was y[14:23], x[25:29]`. The output had the shape (9, 4). How is it 9 rows?\n\nThis is strange.  Maybe the '8's aren't perfectly rectangular? `ys` range from 14 to 23 (10 values). Maybe one of the rows is missing an '8'? I have to carefully examine the set of unique `y` values for the '8's in Example 1.\n\nThe solver *should* return the pixels corresponding to the '8's, and the examples show rectangular outputs. I am beginning to think my shape calculations were off. So, I will be meticulously checking the shape of the '8' region to ensure that the shape I calculate is correct.\n\n\n**Reviewing the Hole-Filling Algorithm**\n\nOkay, so I was initially a bit off with my manual counting, but I've ironed out the slice notation.  It's clear now: the `y[14:23]`  means indices 14 through 22, so 9 elements, and all the holes are indeed rectangles. The probe hole (9, 3) aligns with the solver's grid output.  Good.\n\nI've been thinking about the `best_score` handling. My current code prioritizes the patch with the highest overlap, which effectively means strict matching (`score == max_score`). Given the nature of ARC problems, strict matching is expected. The question is, are multiple strict matches *possible*? If so, does it matter which one I choose, or are the hole contents the same? In all the solved examples, strict matching worked, so I trust that my approach is correct.\n\nI need to cover edge cases. What if the `match_mask` is empty? Unlikely, since the hole won't be the entire grid. The code should handle the target patch boundaries touching the grid edge through slicing, so the context is reduced, but it should be fine due to large grid sizes.\n\nThe final code will, in essence:\n\n1.  Use `numpy`.\n2.  Find 8s' bounding box.\n3.  Define the target region, including context.\n4.  Iterate through all 8 grid transformations.\n5.  Slide a window over the transformed grid.\n6.  Check for strict context match and valid hole content.\n7.  Return the hole content from the best match.\n\nThe sliding window's correct operation at the edge is handled by `matches = (src_patch[match_mask] == target_patch[match_mask])`.\n\nWrapping (toroidal) grids aren't needed, based on successful rigid transformation search.\n\nFor Probe 1, the hole touches the left edge, so the context is only on the top, bottom, and right sides. The code correctly accounts for this with `x_start = 0`.  No issues there. If the hole is in the corner, with only two context sides, I'm hoping the context will be unique enough.\n\nI feel confident.\n\nImplementation details: I'll stick to `numpy`, and the output is the subgrid (hole content), correctly sized. I am going to check if there are multiple perfect matches in the training examples.\n\n\n**Analysis and Implementation of the Solver**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The problem has a unique solution in all cases, so the method is sound. Now it's time to build the code. I'll need `numpy` for array operations. The function will be `solver(input_grid)`. The core logic will involve: 1. Identifying the hole. 2. Defining the context around the hole. 3. Searching for a matching patch. 4. Returning the filled values.\n\nI noticed I had manually added `flip_diag` in a previous piece of code, and `solve_with_context` had `rot90`, `fliplr`, and others. This reminds me that I need to ensure all 8 symmetries of the grid are considered. The dihedral group D4 has 8 elements: Identity, Rotations (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees), Reflections (Horizontal, Vertical, two Diagonals). `FlipLR` and `FlipUD` map to Horizontal and Vertical reflections, respectively. A transpose is Diagonal. I know that, in my numpy code, rotations and reflections can build all the transforms. The operations of rotation and reflections do not commute, so I will need to iterate through all possible transformations.\n\nMy previous list was missing some permutations, so I need to be sure I get the 8.  I will start with the original grid (`g`) and apply: rotations `g`, `rot90(g)`, `rot180(g)`, `rot270(g)`; then apply flips `fliplr(g)`, `rot90(fliplr(g))`, `rot180(fliplr(g))`, `rot270(fliplr(g))`.\n\nI think that set is complete. The set includes both `Transpose` and `Anti-Transpose` operations. So, I will use that for the final code.\n\nNow for the implementation: I will import `numpy`. I'll find the hole (marked by the number 8). I define the bounding box of the hole using the `y` and `x` coordinates. Then I create a region of interest around the hole, with one pixel of context. I extract the target patch, and create `match_mask` and `hole_mask` boolean arrays to identify matching and fill pixels, respectively. I will generate the 8 symmetries and then search. When searching, I will check the valid search range, then check if there is a hole in the source where there is a hole in the target and finally if the context matches. If I get a match, I reshape the fill and return.\n\nOne last thing: is the reshape safe? The `hole_mask` corresponds to the positions of the 8s in the target patch. Since the hole is rectangular, reshapes is guaranteed to work. The indices returned by `np.where`, and boolean indexing, and reshape are all in row-major order, so the reshape is safe.\n\nDouble-checking imports, I have `numpy` only. My code now looks solid. Here's the final solution.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a missing region (denoted by the color 8) in a grid. The grid appears to contain patterns, symmetries, or repetitions. The \"output\" is the content of the missing region.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Input/Output Structure**: The input grids are large (30x30) and contain a rectangular region of 8s. The output grids correspond exactly to the dimensions of this missing region. The task is to \"fill in the blank\".\n2.  **Pattern Detection**:\n    *   Initial periodicity checks (simple translation) failed.\n    *   Symmetry checks showed that some grids have strong symmetries (e.g., Example 1 has Transpose symmetry), but others do not have global symmetries that perfectly reconstruct the hole.\n3.  **Context Matching Hypothesis**:\n    *   The most robust feature of the data is that the region *surrounding* the hole (the context) provides a unique fingerprint.\n    *   We hypothesized that the grid contains a copy of the missing region's pattern somewhere else, possibly transformed (rotated or reflected).\n    *   By defining a \"template\" consisting of the hole plus a 1-pixel border of valid context, we can search the rest of the grid (and its geometric transformations) for a matching context.\n    *   If we find a patch where the border matches the template's border, the center of that patch reveals the hidden content.\n\n**Verification:**\n*   We implemented a `solver` that searches for the template in the input grid and all its 8 symmetries (rotations and reflections).\n*   The solver successfully reconstructed the output for all 4 training examples perfectly (0 mismatches).\n*   The solver also ran successfully on the Probe input, identifying a unique solution.\n\n### FINAL SOLUTION ###\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    # Identify the 'hole' region marked by color 8\n    ys, xs = np.where(input_grid == 8)\n    if len(ys) == 0:\n        return np.array([])\n\n    # Determine the bounding box of the hole\n    y_min, x_min = min(ys), min(xs)\n    y_max, x_max = max(ys), max(xs)\n    \n    # Calculate dimensions of the output (content of the hole)\n    h_out = y_max - y_min + 1\n    w_out = x_max - x_min + 1\n    \n    # Define a Region of Interest (ROI) that includes the hole and a 1-pixel context border\n    # Handle boundary conditions by clipping to the grid dimensions\n    y_start = max(0, y_min - 1)\n    y_end = min(input_grid.shape[0], y_max + 2)\n    x_start = max(0, x_min - 1)\n    x_end = min(input_grid.shape[1], x_max + 2)\n    \n    roi_h = y_end - y_start\n    roi_w = x_end - x_start\n    \n    # Extract the target patch (template) from the input\n    target_patch = input_grid[y_start:y_end, x_start:x_end]\n    \n    # Create masks:\n    # match_mask: The 'context' pixels we need to match (non-8 values)\n    # hole_mask: The pixels we need to fill (8 values)\n    match_mask = (target_patch != 8)\n    hole_mask = (target_patch == 8)\n    \n    # Generate all 8 symmetries of the input grid (D4 group)\n    # This allows us to find the patch even if it is rotated or mirrored elsewhere\n    candidate_grids = []\n    curr_grid = input_grid.copy()\n    for _ in range(4):\n        candidate_grids.append(curr_grid)\n        candidate_grids.append(np.fliplr(curr_grid))\n        curr_grid = np.rot90(curr_grid)\n        \n    # Search for a matching patch in all candidate grids\n    for source_grid in candidate_grids:\n        H, W = source_grid.shape\n        # Skip if source grid is smaller than the patch (unlikely given it's a transform of input)\n        if H < roi_h or W < roi_w:\n            continue\n            \n        # Convolve/Slide window over the source grid\n        for r in range(H - roi_h + 1):\n            for c in range(W - roi_w + 1):\n                src_patch = source_grid[r:r+roi_h, c:c+roi_w]\n                \n                # Condition 1: The candidate patch must contain valid data (no 8s) \n                # in the positions where the target has the hole.\n                # We cannot fill a hole with another hole.\n                if np.any(src_patch[hole_mask] == 8):\n                    continue\n                \n                # Condition 2: The context (non-hole border) must match exactly.\n                if np.array_equal(src_patch[match_mask], target_patch[match_mask]):\n                    # Found a match!\n                    # Extract the values corresponding to the hole\n                    fill_values = src_patch[hole_mask]\n                    \n                    # Reshape the flattened values back to the hole's shape\n                    # This relies on the hole being a rectangle and row-major ordering\n                    return fill_values.reshape(h_out, w_out)\n                    \n    # Fallback: If no match found (should not happen based on training logic), return zeros\n    return np.zeros((h_out, w_out), dtype=int)\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at these ARC examples and trying to figure out what's going on. The user wants me to solve this, which is good. I see the input grids are pretty big \u2013 30x30 \u2013 while the outputs are much smaller. Right away, I'm thinking, \"Okay, this is about extracting a key sub-region from the input.\"\n\nThe first thing that grabs my eye is the prominent presence of the color '8', which is rendered as teal. These aren't just random pixels; they cluster together in blocks within the inputs. I have a feeling this '8' is a clue, a kind of 'pointer' or maybe even a mask. I need to understand its role.\n\nI'm thinking, maybe the '8' block defines a \"target\" area or highlights a region of importance. Maybe the output is the stuff *around* or *beside* the '8' block, or perhaps the '8' block itself is a kind of border and the output is the contents that it frames.\n\nSo, I'm going to look at the relationship between the '8' block's position and the output grid's location. Is it a direct translation, a reflection? Maybe the '8' block is an occluder, and the output is what's 'hidden' or behind it. I'm imagining it's some sort of geometric transformation \u2013 like mirroring, offsetting, or perhaps even reconstructing what is hidden by those solid 8s.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility that the '8' blocks aren't directly part of the output but rather a guide to finding the output in a modified version of the input, where the 8s are treated specially, perhaps as 'broken' or 'invalid' pixels. It could be some geometric pattern, where the block marks a key transformation.\n\nI need to get into the code and start examining the data, I need a better representation for it. I'm going to load these examples into my Python environment and precisely locate these '8' blocks within each input grid and cross-reference their positions with the outputs. I'll check if the output grids are subgrids, and if they are, where they are in relation to these 8's.\n\nI will methodically explore the relationship between the teal blocks and their corresponding output to find that connection.\n\n\n**Deep Dive into Image Transformation Logic**\n\nOkay, so I've been dissecting this script's output, and it's starting to become clear, but there are definitely nuances. The core seems to be about identifying regions in an input image based on the presence of these \"8-blocks\" and then applying some transformation \u2013 either horizontal or vertical flip. The challenge is figuring out *where* that source region is in the original image.\n\nMy initial thought was straightforward mirroring around the image center. However, it seems to be more complex than that.  I've gone through several examples, and while horizontal flips are becoming predictable, the vertical flips are a bit more slippery.\n\nFor horizontal flips, it's starting to look like there's a consistent pattern: you find the mirror of the 8-block, and then there's this weird \"+2\" column shift. Once I account for that, then a horizontal flip of that region produces the output.\n\nHowever, the vertical flip is proving tougher. It doesn't seem to follow the same simple mirror + shift logic. It's like the rows are shifted by +4 (but not always!) and the columns shifted by -2 (also not always!). This inconsistency is making me rethink.\n\nThere are a few key questions that keep popping up:\n*   Is it always about the grid center? Are there some hidden \"anchor\" coordinates I'm not seeing?\n*   Could there be some indicator pixels in the original input?\n*   Should I be using probe to investigate the \"orientation\"?\n\nI'm thinking I'll need to go through each example and write the code to look at the relationships. It's time to refine this hypothesis and hopefully arrive at a solid algorithm.\n\n\n**Unraveling the Geometric Transformations**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've been dissecting these geometric relationships, trying to nail down how we're flipping and mirroring things to get the right output.  Initially, I thought it was a straightforward rule based on the location of the 8-block, whether it was tall or wide, and where it was positioned relative to the edges. But after careful analysis, a pattern began to appear.\n\nIt boiled down to two flip types: Horizontal Flip (FH) and Vertical Flip (FV). The key seemed to be transforming one axis and keeping the other the same.  But which axis to transform? I was calculating distances from edges, checking aspect ratios, but those didn't quite cut it.\n\nThen, I noticed something: the matching coordinates were always the result of a neat little calculation: `Coordinate_Match = 31 - Coordinate_Block`. This means each point is being mirrored across a center, then shifted.\n\nSo, here's my emerging rule: one axis (R or C) gets transformed using `31 - x`. Then, we flip the content along that transformed axis. If it's the column (C), we flip horizontally (FH). If it's the row (R), we flip vertically (FV). Simple, right?\n\nBut why FH sometimes and FV others? That's where it got tricky. Initially, I thought it depended on whether the 8-block was closer to the left/right or top/bottom edge. But this didn't work for all cases. The shape of the block didn't seem to be decisive, either.\n\nThen I realized, it's about the symmetry of the location of that 8-block.\n\nThe decision is which axis is further from the center 14.5. If the block center column is further from center, flip horizontally. If rows are further from center, flip vertically. If the center column offset is significantly larger than the row offset, we mirror horizontally.\n\nEssentially, the program is comparing which axis is 'closer to the edge' (further away from center). With one axis chosen to be transformed, we then mirror the block.\n\n**Analyzing Reflectional Symmetry in Example Grids**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at these grid regions, and initially, they all seem to have valid patterns.  No obvious errors, no glaring noise. Then, I noticed something crucial when I examined Example 2's output. The output grid looks very similar to both the horizontally flipped (FH) and vertically flipped (FV) versions of a region. Eureka! If the reflected regions are identical to the output, *it doesn't matter which reflection I choose!*  This strongly suggests that the underlying grid, or at least the relevant region, has some inherent symmetry.\n\nI have to confirm this with the other examples. With Example 1, for block (14, 25), I'll check both FV and FH reflections. I'll need to calculate which columns and rows to mirror around. Example 3 has block (19, 12) to examine. Here I need to mirror row 11 or reflect column 15. Finally, example 4 presents block (7, 26). I'll have to find the equivalent region to the reflections and check if it matches the output.\n\nMy hypothesis: This inherent symmetry is the key. Finding regions that produce the same output under either reflection is going to simplify the whole process considerably. It could be an elegant shortcut! I'm betting that this is the pattern I need to identify in these Example grids. Let's see if this symmetry holds across all examples.\n\n\n**Revised Understanding of the Transformation and Validation Logic**\n\nAlright, let's consolidate my thinking here. We've established that the fundamental transformation involves either a horizontal or vertical flip of a rectangular region. My initial thought was to use this 'no overlap with 8s' rule to determine the right candidate. However, after further analysis and probing into the edge cases, I believe my hypothesis is still sound. The critical rule is: check *both* possible flip candidates (FH and FV). The real trick is determining which region is \"valid\".\n\nI'm now thinking the source region formula is based on a mirrored coordinate and a shift. It boils down to identifying the region of a block (8s), mirroring that region across the grid's center (29 - x), and then applying a coordinate offset (+2). This offset direction is always positive along the index of the axis being mirrored. This adjustment helps to locate the source region for the respective transformation.\n\nThe 8-block itself doesn't always reflect the nature of the pattern, it can be noise. Thus, the correct transformation would be to transform a region without the eight-block within its original source boundaries.\n\nNow the rule is simple:\n1.  Calculate FH/FV candidate regions using the mirroring and shift.\n2.  Reject candidate if it contains *any* 8s.\n3.  If one region doesn't overlap the block, pick it!\n4.  If both don't overlap, then symmetry is present. The algorithm should pick either as a valid response.\n\nWe've validated this logic with a range of examples. So, my algorithm involves identifying the location of the 8-block, generating the source region for both FH and FV candidates based on the mirrored coordinate and shift, and then checking each candidate for the \"no 8s\" condition. This method has proved effective in identifying the correct transformation to yield the correct pattern.\n\n\n**Delving Deep into Probe 1 and the Unified Shift Rule**\n\nOkay, so I'm focusing on Probe 1 and trying to understand the shift rule. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I see that for the FH (horizontal) candidate, column 27 is valid. Since the mirror is at 29, the delta of -2 fits perfectly, leading to the region 27..29.\n\nNow, for the FV (vertical) candidate, row 7 is the target. The mirror is at 15. The range is 7..15, but a scan finds an invalid area. The actual block location is 14..22. There's overlap because the start of the valid region plus 9 is greater than 14, meaning the overlap is there. Thus, the FV is invalid due to the overlap.\n\nThis confirms that Probe 1 *must* use FH with delta = -2, resulting in a region of rows 14..22 and columns 27..29.\n\nNow, let's explore this \"Unified Shift Rule.\" The match is calculated as (Mirror - Block) + delta.  The rule says that if the block is on the left or top side (less than 14.5), the mirror is on the right/bottom (greater than 14.5) and uses a delta of -2. And if it's the opposite, then delta = +2.\n\nI remember checking Example 1 (the Right example). The mirror is on the left, so +2 works.\n\nNow, Example 2 has the mirror on the bottom (Top). It seems like -2 should work, right? But wait, I recall that Example 2 used FV +2. Hold on...  If I apply -2, it would be 29-2=27. Minus 2 becomes 25, meaning a range 25..28.\n\nVisually, does this region, 25..28, work in the input? Example 2 used 26..29; is 25..28 also valid? If it works, is the rule ambiguous?\n\nIf 25..28 is incorrect, then +2 is the only answer. That said, I'm stuck here. Using +2 for Probe 1 FH was actually Out of Bounds. So, that means Probe 1 needs -2, and this means Example 2 needs -2.\n\nBut hold on, let me check the Example 2 region of 25..28 and see if that yields the correct result, just to be sure...\n\n\n**Analyzing the Shift Rule in Mirroring**\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this mirroring rule.  There's this critical conflict in Example 2 where the vertical shift (`+2` for FV, Bottom to Top Mirror) seems to contradict the horizontal shift (`+2` for FH, Right to Left Mirror) observed elsewhere.  At first, I thought maybe it was about staying within bounds, but then the out-of-bounds rule didn't seem consistent. Then, I considered \"Towards Center\" as the key. \n\nMy initial thought was that the shift is always \"Towards Center\" from the mirror. This meant:\n\n*   Right Block -> Left Mirror: +2 (Towards center)\n*   Bottom Block -> Top Mirror: +2 (Towards center)\n*   Top Block -> Bottom Mirror: +2 (Away from center).\n*   Left Block -> Right Mirror: -2 (Towards center)\n\nThis is inconsistent! But, I realized Example 2 FV might be a red herring. FH worked and was consistent with other examples. I decided to prioritize FH in Example 2.\n\nNext, I tested my \"Towards Center\" rule using `-2` against Probe 1, and with `-2` I arrived at a valid region.\n\nThis led me to **the hypothesis: Mirror, then Shift +2 Towards Center.**  \"Towards Center\" means add 2 if the mirror is smaller than 14.5, subtract 2 if larger.\n\nNow, I'm verifying this on all examples. So far:\n\n*   Example 1: Works.\n*   Example 2: FH works perfectly. FV fails with \"Towards Center\", but does work with \"+2\", so FV is an accident.\n*   Example 3: FV is the ONLY choice. FH fails because of an overlap.\n*   Example 4: FH works, FV works, which is consistent with +2 for FV (away from center).\n\nNow, I need to check the code output for Example 4, FV in particular, to make sure I am on the right track!\n\n\n**Initial Confusion and Breakthrough**\n\nOkay, so I've been wrestling with this coordinate mapping for a bit now. I've been systematically working through these examples, and at first, everything was lining up perfectly. I noticed a consistent pattern: the shift between the source and target coordinates is always +2 within the 0-29 coordinate system. I could express this as `Target = 31 - Source`. This seemed too neat, almost elegant, and I was starting to feel quite confident.\n\n**The OOB Problem and Rethinking**\n\nThen came Probe 1.  I started feeling like there's a problem, though, because when I applied the \"always +2\" rule to Probe 1, the target coordinates were going out of bounds. The start and end values didn't fit within the 0-29 range, which was frustrating. My calculations ended up with coordinates like 30 and 31, which are clearly invalid.\n\n**Investigation and the Need for Verification**\n\nImmediately, my mind started racing.  Could Probe 1 have a different grid size? That would be a major caveat! The script data says it's an 8-block from (14, 0) to (22, 2). I need to dig deeper. I'm going to double-check `probe_inputs[0].shape`, because this might be the key to understanding the exception.  This is a critical moment. It's either an error on my part, or a subtle but important detail in the setup that's been overlooked. I have to find the truth, because the consistency of all the other examples is nagging at me.\n\n\n**Deconstructing the Transformation Logic**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this 30x30 grid. The initial thought process is around identifying the transformation rule.  I started with `31 - Source` as a potential universal rule, but immediately realized it goes out-of-bounds for source indices less than 2, so that's a dead end.\n\nThen, I started considering a `-2` shift for the left and top edges, calculating `Target = 27 - Source`. I checked this `27 - Source` hypothesis against the examples, and it seemed to work, *mostly*.  High sources were fine with the usual `31 - Source`, and even the low source in example 2 (which I had previously used a `+2` shift for) seemed to work now, which was interesting. But then, Probe 1 failed with this simple rule!\n\nThe Probe 1 failure really threw me. I considered the potential of wrap-around using modulo, but quickly discarded it because I expected more contiguous, valid ARC objects.  The \"towards the center\" shift concept emerged, with low sources mirroring to the high end and vice-versa, but my `22..25` example calculation was still incorrect which was a hard constraint that was really nagging me. I *know* from previous examples that a `+2` shift is crucial to the transformation rule.\n\nI even explored the possibility of using Field-of-View (FV) overlap and considered that perhaps overlap with the \"8-block\" might be okay.  However, this was quickly invalidated when I realized that output grids *never* contain the value `8`.  This meant that overlapping with the 8-block was invalid.\n\nSo, Probe 1 *must* use Field-of-High (FH) with the \"+2\" shift.  That's where the problem is.\n\nWith this in mind, the possible issues are:\n\n1.  My coordinate calculations are subtly off.\n2.  The shift rule is different for the left edge.\n3.  There is a special behavior in the 8-block in Probe 1.\n\nI looked at the specific FH `-2` region in Probe 1.  It became apparent that Probe 1 is the real outlier. Perhaps, *k*, the shift, depends on the color of the pixel at the pivot, or maybe it's about maximizing symmetry.\n\nFinally, I developed a robust hypothesis:\n\n**Try FH and FV.**\n\n**For each, calculate Target = 31 - Source.**\n\n**If Target is OOB, try Target = 27 - Source.** (That is, shift `-2`).\n\n**Extract region.**\n\n**If the region contains 8s, discard it.**\n\n**If the region is valid, keep it.**\n\nI validated this rule across all examples and Probe 1.  The conclusion: the rule is \"default Shift +2\". If the shift goes out of bounds, use Shift `-2` *and* check for the absence of `8s` in the final extraction!\n\nI then double-checked Probe 1's `27-Source` region for `8s` to confirm my \"no 8s\" condition. That was the missing piece! All is clear.\n\n\n**Algorithm's Thought Process**\n\nAlright, let's break down this problem. We're given a grid, and there's a specific pattern we need to find, likely related to mirroring or flipping a section. The presence of the value '8' is our key. We need to locate the 8-block first. Once we have that, we'll try to mirror a region across the center and check if it's a plausible fit.\n\nThe plan involves calculating two potential mirrored regions: one horizontal and one vertical. For each candidate region, we first figure out where the mirror image would *start*. Then, we must make sure the potential reflected region falls within the grid boundaries. We must also check that the mirror candidate region doesn't overlap the 8-block that guides us or the value 8 isn't contained *within* our proposed region. If it does, it's not a valid candidate.\n\nIf we find *exactly one* valid candidate, we return that. If there are *two* valid candidates (horizontal and vertical mirror both work), the puzzle is set up so they would be the same so it doesn't matter which we pick. If we don't find *any* valid candidates, which we shouldn't based on the problem, we return the original grid.\n\nTo be sure that my algorithm works, I've run through the examples. I now know that it has to be `+2` shift in the horizontal case.  Let's make sure it handles the edges and overlapping case correctly. The logic appears sound, and it correctly mirrors as per the given examples.\n\nThe problem asks us to find the rule to generate the output grid from an input grid. The input grids contain a distinct rectangular block of 8s (teal). The output grids correspond to a sub-region of the input grid, transformed in some way.\n\n**Analysis via Python Tool:**\n1.  **Object Identification**: In all training examples and probe inputs, there is exactly one contiguous rectangular block of `8`s. The output dimensions match the dimensions of this 8-block.\n2.  **Transformation Search**: By matching the output grid (and its flips) against the input grid, we found that the output is always a **mirrored** version of a specific source region in the input.\n    *   **Example 1**: The 8-block is on the right. The output matches a region on the left (same rows), **Flipped Horizontally**.\n    *   **Example 2**: The 8-block is at the top-right. The output matches a region at the top-left (same rows), **Flipped Horizontally**. (It also matches a region at the bottom-right, Flipped Vertically).\n    *   **Example 3**: The 8-block is at the bottom-center. The output matches a region at the top-center (same cols), **Flipped Vertically**.\n    *   **Example 4**: The 8-block is on the right. The output matches a region on the left, **Flipped Horizontally**.\n3.  **Coordinate Mapping**:\n    *   The source region is located at the position symmetric to the 8-block across the grid center, with a **shift of 2 pixels**.\n    *   Coordinate transformation formula: `Target_Coordinate = (Grid_Size - 1 - Block_Coordinate) + 2`.\n    *   This formula worked perfectly for Examples 1, 3, and 4 (and Ex 2 FV).\n    *   For **Probe 1**, the 8-block is on the far left. The standard formula `(29 - 0) + 2 = 31` puts the target out of bounds.\n    *   However, applying a shift of `-2` (`Target = 27`) finds a valid region that does not overlap the 8-block.\n    *   The general rule is to prioritize the `+2` shift, but fallback to `-2` if `+2` leads to an out-of-bounds region or a region containing the 8-block itself (which is invalid as the source cannot be the occluder).\n\n**Rule Summary**:\n1.  Identify the bounding box of the 8-block.\n2.  Check for **Horizontal Symmetry**:\n    *   Calculate the column range symmetric to the 8-block's columns: `start = (W - 1) - c_max`.\n    *   Try shifting this start by `+2`. If the resulting region is valid (in-bounds and contains no 8s), extract it and **Flip Horizontally**.\n    *   If `+2` fails, try `-2`.\n3.  Check for **Vertical Symmetry**:\n    *   Calculate the row range symmetric to the 8-block's rows: `start = (H - 1) - r_max`.\n    *   Try shifting by `+2`. If valid, extract and **Flip Vertically**.\n    *   If `+2` fails, try `-2`.\n4.  Return the valid extracted grid.\n\n### FINAL SOLUTION ###\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    # Find the bounding box of the color 8 (teal)\n    coords = np.argwhere(input_grid == 8)\n    if coords.size == 0:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    r_min, c_min = coords.min(axis=0)\n    r_max, c_max = coords.max(axis=0)\n    \n    h_block = r_max - r_min + 1\n    w_block = c_max - c_min + 1\n    \n    grid_h, grid_w = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # We look for a source region symmetric to the 8-block.\n    # The symmetry is \"Mirror across Center\" plus a shift.\n    # The standard shift is +2, but we fallback to -2 if +2 is invalid.\n    shifts = [2, -2]\n    \n    # Candidate 1: Horizontal Symmetry (Flip Horizontal)\n    # Logic: Mirror the columns across the center vertical axis.\n    # Source rows correspond to the 8-block's rows.\n    r_start = r_min\n    r_end = r_max + 1\n    \n    for shift in shifts:\n        # Calculate mirrored column start\n        # Formula: (Grid_Width - 1) - Max_Col + Shift\n        c_start = (grid_w - 1) - c_max + shift\n        c_end = c_start + w_block\n        \n        # Check if the region is within bounds\n        if 0 <= c_start and c_end <= grid_w:\n            region = input_grid[r_start:r_end, c_start:c_end]\n            # Check if the region is free of the blocker (8)\n            if not np.any(region == 8):\n                # Apply Horizontal Flip to the extracted region\n                return np.fliplr(region)\n\n    # Candidate 2: Vertical Symmetry (Flip Vertical)\n    # Logic: Mirror the rows across the center horizontal axis.\n    # Source cols correspond to the 8-block's cols.\n    c_start = c_min\n    c_end = c_max + 1\n    \n    for shift in shifts:\n        # Calculate mirrored row start\n        # Formula: (Grid_Height - 1) - Max_Row + Shift\n        r_start_m = (grid_h - 1) - r_max + shift\n        r_end_m = r_start_m + h_block\n        \n        # Check if the region is within bounds\n        if 0 <= r_start_m and r_end_m <= grid_h:\n            region = input_grid[r_start_m:r_end_m, c_start:c_end]\n            # Check if the region is free of the blocker (8)\n            if not np.any(region == 8):\n                # Apply Vertical Flip to the extracted region\n                return np.flipud(region)\n\n    return input_grid\n```",

PROTOCOL ***\n\nYou are an expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect equipped with a **python tool**.\nYour goal is to write a final, robust `solver(input_grid)` function.\nThe `input_grid` provided to `solver` will be a **2D NumPy array**.\nYou are provided with **Solved Training Pairs** (to derive the rule) and **Unlabeled Probe Inputs** (to test generalizability).\n\n**CRITICAL RULE:** Do NOT guess. Do NOT rely on visual intuition alone. You must PROVE your solution works using the tool.\n\n### PHASE 1: EXPERIMENTATION (Mandatory Tool Usage)\nBefore answering, you must use the python tool to perform this cycle:\n\n1.  **Load Data**: The python environment starts empty. Write a script to define:\n    *   `train_inputs` and `train_outputs` (from the Solved Examples, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n    *   `probe_inputs` (from the Input-Only Data, converted to **numpy arrays**).\n\n2.  **Analyze**: Use numpy and cv2 to inspect ALL grids (training + probes). \n    *   *Check the Probes*: Do they have different sizes? Do they introduce new colors? \n    *   Ensure your rule does not rely on assumptions that the Probes violate.\n\n3.  **Prototype & Verify (The Loop)**:\n    *   Draft a candidate `solver` function inside the tool.\n    *   **Test 1 (Accuracy)**: Run the function on ALL `train_inputs` and assert that the result matches `train_outputs` EXACTLY.\n    *   **Test 2 (Generalization)**: Run the function on ALL `probe_inputs`. \n        *   Since you don't have the answers, you cannot check accuracy. \n        *   INSTEAD, CHECK FOR CRASHES. Ensure the function runs without error (e.g., no `IndexError`, `ValueError`) and returns a valid grid.\n    *   **Refine**: If any test fails, use `print()` to see the error/diff, rewrite the function, and run the cycle again.\n    *   Repeat until your python script prints \"ALL TRAINING PASSED & PROBES VALID\".\n\n### PHASE 2: FINAL OUTPUT\nOnce (and ONLY once) you have a valid python script that has passed the verification loop in the logs:\n\n1.  Output the final, standalone `solver(input_grid)` function.\n2.  The code must be self-contained (import numpy as np, cv2 inside).\n3.  **Do not include the test harness or data loading** in the final block. Just the solver function.\n4.  **CRITICAL**: You MUST copy your verified solver into a final block preceded by exactly this label: `### FINAL SOLUTION ###`\n5.  Your response must conclude with this final block. Do not end with tool output or partial analysis.\n\nFormat:\n### FINAL SOLUTION ###\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    # input_grid is a 2D numpy array\n    # ...\n```",
