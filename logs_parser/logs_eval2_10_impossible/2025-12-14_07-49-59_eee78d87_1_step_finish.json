My initial focus is to analyze the input and output grids.\n\n**Input Grids**\n\nAll the input grids are 6x6. Each one has a background color, which is always orange (7), and another color which forms some kind of specific pattern. I'm going through each example, painstakingly writing out the color codes at specific coordinates, trying to grasp the visual logic. For the first example, I see a green plus shape.\n\nI'm thinking, \"Is there a relationship between the colors and shapes?\" The second input looks like a blue diamond or an 'H' shape, or is it more like corners and center? Let's check coordinates. I'm noting specific coordinates that define the shape.  The third has a magenta 'X'.\n\nI'm starting to consider how each input color/shape influences the output. I'm also carefully checking the test input. What's the pattern? Two red dots in the corners. Okay, it's starting to look like each input has a 3x3 pattern in a 6x6 grid. Maybe this local 3x3 pattern is the key.\n\n**Output Grids**\n\nI'm now switching to the output grids, and they're all 16x16. These are way bigger! I am observing how it might be constructed from smaller, repeating units. Are they 5x5 blocks? Maybe 3x3 scaled up? Let's look at the outputs... I see rows and columns of zeros, which suggests some kind of tiling or a grid structure. \n\nI'm getting closer, and it seems like the output is made of these repeating \"macro-pixels.\" Rows 0, 3, 6, etc., and columns 0, 3, 6, etc., have zeros. I\u2019m starting to think about horizontal and vertical \"grid lines\" that define these repeating macro-pixels. There are these bold maroon (color 9) patches in the middle that really pop out. The 9s form this rectangular region, it's probably the visual highlight. I see they are not in all locations. Okay, it's 5x5. The zeros act as separators! I will call these the grid lines.\n\n**Connecting Input and Output**\n\nNow, I'm trying to connect the dots between the input and output. The output seems to replicate a smaller grid from the input. What is the relation between the color in the inputs, and the shape or tile style in the output. The output grids seem to be made of 5x5 blocks. So, is there a 5x5 input to output correspondence? Each input seems to have a centered 3x3 pattern in each grid. I start comparing the input and output grids side by side. I'm seeing 7s in some output cells, and 0s in others. How is the tile color related to the colors in the input pattern? The output tiles have 7s, 0s and 9s. I can see 0s for the lines. I am realizing that maybe this 5x5 output is a zoomed-in representation of the 3x3 input pattern.\n\nI look closer at the 9s. The 9s seem to be in this kind of central frame around one of the cells. The 9's overwrite any other color. I think the 9s are always centered around a tile and only overwrite the center tile and one pixel on its adjacent tiles.\n\n**Discovering the Pattern**\n\nHere's my hypothesis: The output is a 5x5 grid of 2x2 blocks separated by 1-pixel lines. And, the key is this 3x3 region in the input, because that's what seems to define how the output is styled. And I realize, based on examples, there are a few texture styles. The style is not a one-to-one mapping, though. The colors of the grid lines vs the colors of the tiles. In some examples, the lines are black, tiles are orange; in others, the lines are orange, tiles are black.\n\nThis is my insight! The output grid texture is determined by the input 3x3 pattern. Let's look at the three examples, one-by-one! For instance, the horizontal and vertical lines will have specific colors. It appears that horizontal lines match with the horizontal mid-row pixels from the input, while vertical lines match with the vertical-mid col in the input.\n\nEx 1: If mid row is full (all 3 values of the color), then the output has Black horizontal lines. Same for the cols. If the tile has some pattern, the texture will be a tile\n\nThe transformation involves identifying a 3x3 pattern within the input grid and generating a 16x16 output grid based on specific features of that pattern. The output grid is a structured 5x5 array of 2x2 tiles separated by 1-pixel wide grid lines.\n\n**Logic derived from examples:**\n1.  **Pattern Extraction:**\n    -   Locate the 3x3 region in the 6x6 input that contains the colored pattern (non-7 values).\n    -   **Test Input Pattern:** The pattern is a 3x3 box formed by Red (2) pixels at the corners `(0,2), (0,4), (2,2), (2,4)`. The rest of the 3x3 area is empty (7).\n        -   Top Row: `2 7 2` (Corners filled)\n        -   Middle Row: `7 7 7` (Empty)\n        -   Bottom Row: `2 7 2` (Corners filled)\n        -   Middle Column: `7 7 7` (Empty)\n\n2.  **Determine Output Grid Style (Texture):**\n    -   The style of the grid lines (Horizontal/Vertical) and the Tiles depends on the fullness of the 3x3 pattern's rows/columns.\n    -   **Horizontal Lines:** If the Middle Row of the pattern is full (contains pattern colors), the lines are Black (0). If empty, they are Orange (7).\n        -   Test Middle Row is empty -> **Horizontal Lines = 7**.\n    -   **Vertical Lines:** If the Middle Column of the pattern is full, the lines are Black (0). If empty, they are Orange (7).\n        -   Test Middle Column is empty -> **Vertical Lines = 7**.\n    -   **Tiles:** If the pattern corners are filled, the tiles are Black (0). If empty, they are Orange (7).\n        -   Test Corners are filled -> **Tiles = 0**.\n    -   **Intersections:** Grid line intersections are always Black (0).\n\n3.  **Construct Base Grid:**\n    -   The grid is 16x16. Lines are at indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n    -   Based on the style determined:\n        -   **Intersections:** (0,0), (0,3)... are 0.\n        -   **Horizontal Segments:** (0,1), (0,2), (0,4)... are 7.\n        -   **Vertical Segments:** (1,0), (2,0), (4,0)... are 7.\n        -   **Tiles:** (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)... are 0.\n\n4.  **Apply Highlight Overlay:**\n    -   A highlight box is applied to the center of the grid, specifically covering the area from **rows 6 to 9** and **columns 5 to 10**.\n    -   **Rule:** In this region, any pixel that is Black (0) becomes Maroon (9). Pixels that are Orange (7) remain Orange (7).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\nThe Test Input pattern features (Empty Middle Row, Empty Middle Column, Filled Corners) match exactly with Example 3. Therefore, the output grid will be identical to the output of Example 3.\n\n**Output Grid generation:**\n-   **Rows 0, 3, 12, 15 (Base Lines):** `0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n-   **Rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 13, 14 (Base Tiles):** `7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n-   **Rows 6, 9 (Center Lines with Overlay):**\n    -   Base: `0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n    -   Overlay (cols 5-10): Change 0 to 9.\n    -   Result: `0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n-   **Rows 7, 8 (Center Tiles with Overlay):**\n    -   Base: `7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n    -   Overlay (cols 5-10): Change 0 to 9.\n    -   Result: `7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7`\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_3_step_1\">\n### What the examples show\n\n**1) The output is always a 16\u00d716 \u201cgrid of cells\u201d**\n- 16 comes from drawing a **5\u00d75 board** where each cell interior is **2\u00d72**, separated by **1-pixel-wide grid lines**:\n  \\[\n  5\\cdot 2\\;+\\;6\\cdot 1 \\;=\\; 16\n  \\]\n- Therefore the **grid-line indices** are every 3 cells:\n  - Rows: **1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16**\n  - Cols: **1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16**\n- Intersections of grid lines stay **0**.\n\n**2) The input decides which grid lines are drawn in color 7**\nIn each input, there is one \u201cobject\u201d color (not 7) inside a **3\u00d73 bounding box**.

The goal is to take a 6x6 input grid and transform it into a 16x16 output grid, and the transformation depends on a few factors. Let's break it down:\n\n**Input Analysis:** The input grids all have a dominant orange background (color 7) and a secondary pattern of a different color. I see the patterns as sort of a plus sign, a diamond, and an \"X,\" respectively, in the examples. Importantly, there are no overlaps in the patterns, and they are embedded within a larger array. The test input has 4 dots, which forms the corners of a square (::).\n\n**Output Structure:** The 16x16 output grids have a distinct grid-like structure. They are composed of a series of 2x2 \"tiles\" separated by single-pixel \"lines,\" creating a 5x5 array of tiles (where 5 * 3 + 1 = 16 pixels per side). I noticed that the color of these lines and tiles isn't random; it's a key part of the transformation.\n\n**Key Insight: The input pattern determines the output Style, not the content of each tile.** The core idea is that the output visually represents the presence of a pattern in the input (I was initially going down the path of trying to build the tiles based on pixel-by-pixel, and this was not the case). The important concept is the background/Tile Style and the Highlight shape. This is what changes based on the input pattern.\n\n**Style and Color Mapping:** There is a clear mapping between the secondary color in the input and the overall output style. The input color's \"style\" has 3 parts: H-lines, V-lines, and Tiles. The style is not a direct encoding but a code based on the binary bits of the color. In my examples:\n- Color 3 (Green) -> Tiles (Black lines, colored tile. Tiles=7, Lines=0).\n- Color 1 (Blue) -> Vertical Lines (Black tiles, color V-lines. Tiles=0, V-Lines=7).\n- Color 6 (Magenta) -> Grid (H and V Lines are color. Tiles=0, H-lines=7, V-lines=7).\n- Color 2 (Test-Red) -> Horizontal lines.\n\n**The Highlight (Center Box):** This is the final piece of the puzzle. There is a consistent \"highlight\" region in the output, always centered on the center tile (T(2,2)) of the 5x5 tile grid. This highlight is a 6x6 box, 0-indexed Cols 5-10, Rows 5-10. This 6x6 box replaces all 0 values with a highlight value (9), masking anything that is already 7. The highlight shape is *always* 6x6, and it overrides the style. It changes based on the Input Color/Style.\n\n**The output Highlight shape:** This *always* creates a 6x6 rectangle that visually expands from the center, creating a highlight, and the spill can vary based on the Style.\n\n**In summary:**\n1.  **Read the Input.**\n2.  **Determine the Output Style:** Identify which style to build based on the input pattern color.\n3.  **Construct the Base Grid:** Create the 16x16 grid with the base tile and line colors dictated by the selected output style.\n4.  **Apply the Highlight:** Always fill the 6x6 Highlight Box with color 9 *replacing* the underlying 0 value, not the 7 value, thus preserving the tile/line separation.\n5.  **Output the result.**\n\nThe critical aspect is understanding that the color of the tiles and lines in the output is linked directly to the color of the pattern in the input, not the pixel content. It's about a visual representation of presence, not a direct pixel-by-pixel copy or mapping of the image. The pattern in the input gives an indicator of the visual transformation which, in turn, is a visual grid style with a highlight.\n\n\nThe task requires inferring the transformation rule from 6x6 input grids to 16x16 output grids. The input grids contain a background of color 7 (orange) with a geometric pattern of another color. The output grids are stylized representations of a $5 \\times 5$ tile grid, where the style and a central highlight are determined by the input pattern's color.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Output Structure**: The output is always a $16 \\times 16$ grid representing $5 \\times 5$ tiles. Each tile is $2 \\times 2$ pixels, separated by 1-pixel wide grid lines.\n    *   Tiles correspond to rows/cols indices: 1-2, 4-5, 7-8, 10-11, 13-14.\n    *   Grid lines correspond to rows/cols indices: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n\n2.  **Base Style Determined by Input Pattern Color**:\n    *   **Color 3 (Green)** $\\to$ **Tiles Style**: Tiles are filled with color 7, lines are color 0. (Example 1)\n    *   **Color 1 (Blue)** $\\to$ **Vertical Lines Style**: Vertical grid lines are color 7, tiles and horizontal lines are color 0. (Example 2)\n    *   **Color 6 (Magenta)** $\\to$ **Grid Style**: Vertical and horizontal grid lines are color 7 (intersections are 0), tiles are color 0. (Example 3)\n    *   **Test Input Color 2 (Red)**: Following the logic (1=Vertical, 6=Grid/Both, 3=Tiles), color 2 maps to **Horizontal Lines Style**.\n        *   Horizontal grid lines (rows 0, 3, 6...) are color 7 (segments) with 0 at intersections.\n        *   Vertical grid lines and tiles are color 0.\n\n3.  **Highlight Rule**:\n    *   A \"Highlight\" of color 9 (Maroon) is applied to a specific region of the output grid.\n    *   The region is a **$6 \\times 6$ square centered on the grid**.\n    *   Region coordinates: Rows 5-10, Columns 5-10.\n    *   **Application Rule**: In this region, any pixel that is 0 becomes 9. Pixels that are 7 remain 7.\n\n**Constructing the Test Output:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Base Grid (Horizontal Lines Style)**\n    *   Horizontal Grid Rows (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15): The pattern is `0, 7, 7, 0` repeated.\n        *   Row sequence: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n    *   All other rows (Tiles and Vertical Lines): Filled with `0`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Apply Highlight**\n    *   Target Region: Rows 5 through 10, Columns 5 through 10.\n    *   **Row 5 (Tile Row)**: Originally all `0`. Columns 5-10 become `9`.\n        *   `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`\n    *   **Row 6 (Grid Row)**: Originally `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0...`.\n        *   Col 5 is 7 (stays 7).\n        *   Col 6 is 0 (becomes 9).\n        *   Cols 7-8 are 7 (stay 7).\n        *   Col 9 is 0 (becomes 9).\n        *   Col 10 is 7 (stays 7).\n        *   Result: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n    *   **Rows 7, 8 (Tile Rows)**: Originally all `0`.

The user wants me to solve this ARC task, and it seems pretty straightforward once you break it down. I've got to create a 16x16 grid based on the provided examples and test input. The prompt hints strongly at the solution.\n\nFirst, I observe that all the inputs are 6x6 grids with a color 7 background (orange) and a distinct shape/glyph formed by a different color (1, 2, 3, or 6). I need to analyze how these glyphs dictate the structure of the 16x16 output grid. The outputs also have a repeating pattern with colors 0, 7, and 9. I also note the \"transformation description\" which is very useful.\n\n**Input Analysis and Lattice Structure:**\n\nI start by looking at the examples and identifying the core pattern. The inputs always have a single color that forms some sort of glyph against a constant background color. I deduce that the crucial element for the output is the presence of the lattice.\n\nAll the outputs are 16x16 grids. The critical element seems to be a lattice with a period of 3. This means horizontal and vertical lines at indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 (0-indexed). I will call these \"lattice lines\". These lines define a grid structure.\n\n**Color-Specific Lattice Rules:**\n\nI see that different input colors map to different lattice configurations:\n\n*   **Color 3 (Green) - Example 1:** \"Cells are 7\". The output grid looks like the lattice lines are black (0), and the cells are orange (7).\n*   **Color 1 (Blue) - Example 2:** \"Vertical lines 7\". Vertical lines are orange (7). Horizontal lines and cells are black (0).\n*   **Color 6 (Magenta) - Example 3:** \"All lines are 7\". Both vertical and horizontal lines are orange (7), so it makes an orange grid.\n\nI infer the crucial logic: each of the different colors will select parts of the lattice to be a different color.\n\n**Deduction for Test Input (Color 2, Red):**\n\nThe prompt doesn't explicitly define color 2. I need to figure out what pattern to apply. I look at the shape given in the test input. It consists of horizontal segments. I make the hypothesis that color 2 should be mapped to the horizontal lattice segments. I look for something orthogonal and complementary. Since Color 1 uses Vertical and Color 6 all lines, it logically follows that the Color 2 will be Horizontal lines.\n\n**Construction of the Output Grid:**\n\n1.  **Lattice definition:** I define the lattice structure based on indices divisible by 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15).\n2.  **Color 2 Transformation:** I apply the rule: Horizontal lattice segments are orange (7), and the rest is black (0).\n3.  **Central Highlight:** I apply the final part: highlight. There is a central 6x6 area (indices 5-10 for both rows and columns) where the 0s become 9.\n\n**Generated Grid:**\n\nI build the grid now.\nThe output has 16 rows and 16 columns (indices from 0-15):\n\n*   The lattice rows are: rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15. The horizontal lattice parts are 7. The non-lattice columns are 0.\n*   The non-lattice rows are the rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14. All elements are 0, except for those in the range of the central 6x6 highlight (rows 5 to 10 and columns 5 to 10), which are converted from 0 to 9.\n\nSo based on this logic, I construct the result.\n```\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0\n\nTo solve this problem, I will break down the transformation rules by analyzing the solved examples and applying the logic to the test input.\n\n### 1. Grid Structure and Lattice Definition\nThe output is always a 16x16 grid. The description and examples point to a lattice structure with a period of 3.\n- **Lattice Lines**: Rows and Columns at indices $0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15$.\n- **Lattice Intersections**: Points where both row and column indices are lattice lines (e.g., $(0,0), (3,6)$). These appear to always be color 0 (black).\n- **Lattice Segments**: Parts of a lattice line between intersections.\n  - **Horizontal Segments**: Row is a lattice line, Column is not.\n  - **Vertical Segments**: Column is a lattice line, Row is not.\n- **Cells**: Regions where neither row nor column are lattice lines (the 2x2 areas inside the mesh).\n\n### 2. Logic for Coloring the Lattice\nThe input glyph color determines which parts of the lattice pattern are colored 7 (orange). The rest is 0 (black).\n- **Example 1 (Color 3, Shape '+')**: The logic provided implies that lattice lines are 0 and cells are 7. This is an \"inverse\" lattice or simply filling the cells.\n- **Example 2 (Color 1, Shape 'H')**: Vertical lattice segments are colored 7. Everything else (Horizontal segments, Cells, Intersections) is 0. This matches the vertical nature of the 'H'.\n- **Example 3 (Color 6, Shape 'Diamond/X')**: Both Vertical and Horizontal lattice segments are colored 7. Cells and Intersections are 0. This matches the connected grid shape.\n\n**Inference for Test Input (Color 2)**:\nThe test input contains color 2. The shape appears to be two horizontal pairs of dots.\nGiven the set of transformations:\n- Vertical Segments = 7 (Color 1)\n- Vertical & Horizontal Segments = 7 (Color 6)\n- The missing logical component is **Horizontal Segments = 7**.\nTherefore, for Color 2, we apply the rule: **Horizontal lattice segments are 7, everything else is 0.**\n\n### 3. Central Highlight\nA specific region of the grid is highlighted by changing color 0 to color 9 (maroon). Color 7 is unaffected.\n- **Region**: \"Rows 6\u201311, cols 6\u201311\" in 1-based numbering corresponds to **indices 5\u201310** (0-based) inclusive. This creates a centered 6x6 area.\n\n### 4. Constructing the Output for Test Input (Color 2)\n\n**Step A: Generate Base Pattern (Horizontal Segments = 7)**\n- **Lattice Rows** (Indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15):\n  - Intersection columns (0, 3, 6...) are 0.\n  - Segment columns (1, 2, 4, 5...) are 7.\n  - Pattern: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n- **Non-Lattice Rows** (Indices 1, 2, 4, 5...):\n  - These contain no horizontal lattice segments.\n  - Pattern: All `0`s.\n\n**Step B: Apply Highlight (Indices 5\u201310)**\nWe modify the base pattern for rows 5 through 10, specifically at columns 5 through 10.\n- **Rows 5, 7, 8, 10** (Non-Lattice Rows):\n  - Base: All 0.\n  - Highlight: Zeros in columns 5\u201310 become 9.\n  - Result segment (cols 5-10): `9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9`.\n  - Full Row: `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`\n- **Rows 6, 9** (Lattice Rows):\n  - Base: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n  - Columns 5\u201310 values: `7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7`.\n  - Apply Highlight (0->9, 7->7): `7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7`.\n  - Full Row: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n\n**Step C: Compile Final Grid**\n- Rows 0, 3, 12, 15: Base Lattice Row.\n- Rows 1, 2, 4, 11, 13, 14: Base Non-Lattice Row (All 0).\n- Rows 5, 7, 8, 10: Highlighted Non-Lattice Row.\n- Rows 6, 9: Highlighted Lattice Row.\n\noutput:\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n<REASONING_MODEL_C model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n**Okay, here's my thought process on this ARC task.**\n\nThe user wants me to solve an ARC task, and I need to figure out the pattern in three provided examples to determine how to apply the pattern to the test input. I'm an expert in this field so I have a lot of tools at my disposal.\n\nI start by breaking down each example. I focus on the relationship between the input grid (shape and its color) and the output 16x16 grid, paying close attention to any color changes or patterns.\n\n**Example 1**:\nI see a cross shape in the input, colored green (color 3). I notice that the output grid has a lattice-like pattern where specific cells are colored differently, and there's a 6x6 highlight in the center.\n\n- I meticulously examine coordinates to try and understand the lattice structure.  I determine that the cell value is 0 if either the row or column index is divisible by 3 and 7 otherwise (unless in the highlight region). The pattern seems to use a 0, 7 structure. The hint emphasizes the highlight region, showing it's cells should be converted to 9.\n\n**Example 2**:\nHere, the input has an \"H\" shape in blue (color 1). The output is again a 16x16 grid with a similar lattice structure and highlight.\n\n-  I study the pattern and deduce that it's different this time. I find that cells where the row index is NOT divisible by 3, and the column index IS divisible by 3, the value is 7. Otherwise is 0.\n- So, the pattern is: 0 if row divisible by 3, or if the column index is not divisible by 3, is 0. I notice vertical struts.\n\n**Example 3**:\nThis time, it is colored magenta (color 6). The shape is an 'X' (or a checkerboard).\n\n- I carefully analyze the output pattern. I determine that if either the row OR the column is a multiple of 3. the output is 0, except where both rows and columns are multiples of 3. Otherwise the value is 7.\n- I read the description closely to gain more info. I read the hint: \"6->7 where rLine XOR cLine\" in the prompt. This confirmed my understanding.\n\nI think about the connection between the shape color and the lattice structure. I see a pattern:\n\n- **Green (3)** maps to a standard lattice (0 at intersections, 7 elsewhere).\n- **Blue (1)** maps to a vertical-dominated lattice (7 only on vertical lines).\n- **Magenta (6)** maps to a lattice where horizontal and vertical lines are 7, excluding intersections/holes.\n\n**Test Input**:\nThe shape is red (color 2), and it looks like a collection of 4 dots in a box. I have to find the pattern for color 2. I have rules now for 1, 3, 6, and I can start to make a hypothesis based on prior knowledge.\n\nMy current theory: There must be a relationship based on vertical and horizontal lines. Since Blue is Vertical, I hypothesize that RED will be horizontal. This means that cells at multiples of 3 in the row must output a 7 when the column is not a multiple of 3. Otherwise, 0. I apply this. I create the base, the pattern for the grid that excludes the highlight region. The rule is for Color 2: $7$ if the row is divisible by 3, and the column is not divisible by 3. Otherwise, is 0.\n\nNow that I have the base pattern defined, I apply the highlight to the grid (rows 5-10, cols 5-10). Any 0 in this range becomes a 9.\n\nFinally, I write out the complete output grid in the specified format, ready to solve the user's request.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples and the provided description, here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Input Glyph and Color**:\n    The test input contains a shape made of color 2 (Red) against a background of 7. The shape consists of pixels at (0,2), (0,4), (2,2), (2,4), suggesting a horizontal alignment or relationship.\n\n2.  **Infer the Lattice Logic**:\n    The problem maps the glyph color to a specific logic for generating a 16x16 background lattice (lines at indices divisible by 3).\n    *   **Color 3 (Green)**: Sets the lattice lines (rows/cols divisible by 3) to 0, holes to 7. (Logic: 0 if RowLine OR ColLine).\n    *   **Color 1 (Blue)**: Sets vertical line segments to 7, everything else to 0. (Logic: 7 if ColLine AND NOT RowLine).\n    *   **Color 6 (Magenta)**: Sets both vertical and horizontal line segments to 7, intersections and holes to 0. (Logic: 7 if RowLine XOR ColLine).\n    *   **Color 2 (Red)**: By observing the pattern (1 is Vertical, 6 is Both, 3 is Inverted Both), Color 2 corresponds to **Horizontal line segments**. The logic is: assign 7 only on horizontal lattice lines excluding the intersections (where columns are also lattice lines), and 0 elsewhere.\n    \n    **Pattern for Color 2**:\n    *   **On Lattice Rows (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15)**: If the column is NOT a lattice column (indices 1, 2, 4, 5, etc.), the cell is 7.

Got it. Let's dig in. I'm seeing 6x6 input grids and bigger output grids. The input mostly has orange (7) with some other colored patterns.  I noticed the output seems to be this repeating tiling of larger grids.\n\nI'm starting to see that the output is always 16x16 and it's built of these 2x2 \"cells\" and 1-pixel-wide gaps. The 0s create the grid. There's a 5x5 array of 2x2 tiles. The inputs don't line up neatly with the output tile size. Noted, need to figure out the connection between 6x6 input and 5x5 tile array.\n\nThe input patterns aren't just random. They've got these specific shapes or patterns of colors. Green (3) is a plus, blue (1) an H-shape, and magenta (6) an X shape.  The test input is a square of red (2).\n\nNow, the output isn't a direct scaling of the input pattern. The 9s show up in this specific 5x5 region. The number 9 becomes key because it creates that highlight within the output. The background pattern in each example is something different.\n\nThere's this hypothesis that the 6x6 input is being mapped to a 5x5 tile array. The 6x6 input is not the same as the 5x5 output.  The output might be representing local neighborhoods of these \"special color\" shapes. Let's use the term *intrusion color* when referring to the non-orange pixels.\n\nI got curious about the *structure* of the output and how that related to the input grid. I had this idea that maybe the pixel values in the input are being \"blown up\", but the size mismatch, 6x6 and 16x16 doesn't quite work. I did notice that the outputs are either filled with all \"7\" or black with orange separators.\n\nIt appears the background or texture of each output is related to a property of the input.  One hypothesis. The texture of the output is determined by the \"intrusion color\", that's interesting.\n\nThe outputs have the central grid area (Indices 5-10) is always highlighted.  I'm calling the central highlighted block the \"9-box\". It seems the intrusion color determines *something* about the structure.\n\nA hypothesis is that the output grids represent the \"walls\" of a 5x5 grid or the intersections of those lines. This makes me consider a coordinate-based interpretation of the grid. It's like a lattice structure. The pattern of 7s and 0s relates to some pattern or code, related to `mod 3`.\n\nI had to backtrack.  I was trying to map each 3x3 input pattern onto a cell in the output and I just wasn't making it work.\n\nThe color (3) -> Background texture is based on the logic: if `x%3==0`, pixel is 0, else 7.  The texture is then applied to the output.\n\nThere seems to be an underlying structure based on the color's numerical value and the logic gate structure to define the background texture. These are: `!SepX && !SepY` and `SepX|SepY`, `SepX^SepY`, where I define `SepX` as the rows that are \"Separator\" rows and `SepY` as the Columns which are \"Separator\".\n\nColors -> Textures. Colors might map to a logic gate. A truth table. I need to figure out this connection between the color (3,1,6,2) and the logic (AND, OR, XOR). If the input texture is XOR, I use all 0s for the tiles and I draw in 7s around a grid shape.\n\nAfter lots of testing and hypotheses, I'm thinking the colors encode a 4-bit integer, which can be interpreted as a truth table. Then I define that the *logic* of the output depends on whether the 2D grid coordinate has its x and y coordinate, modulus 3, as a \"separator\" or \"cell\".\n\nThe color number encodes an output pattern according to the state (Sep/Cell, Sep/Cell) and the output is then encoded in the final pixel value.\n\n*   1 (Blue) translates to OR. `0111`.\n*   6 (Magenta) is XOR (0110).\n*   3 (Green) to the bitmask with value 3 (0011).\n\nThe final\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid.\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation involves the following logic:\n\n1.  **Output Structure:** The 16x16 output grid represents a 5x5 grid of 2x2 \"cells\" separated by 1-pixel wide lines (separators).\n    *   Separators are at indices $x, y \\in \\{0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15\\}$.\n    *   Cells are at the indices between separators.\n    *   The \"coordinates\" of a pixel $(r, c)$ can be described by whether it falls on a separator or in a cell. Let $S_r = (r \\% 3 == 0)$ and $S_c = (c \\% 3 == 0)$.\n\n2.  **Background Texture:** The input grid contains a pattern of a specific color (other than orange/7) against an orange background. This \"intrusion color\" determines the background texture of the output grid.\n    *   The texture is defined by a logic function determining whether a pixel is orange (7) or black (0).\n    *   **Example 1 (Color 3 - Green):** The texture corresponds to Pattern 1 where only pixels that are *inside cells* (both row and column are not separators) are orange.\n        *   Logic: $7$ if $(!S_r \\land !S_c)$, else $0$.\n        *   Mapping: Color 3 $\\to$ Truth Table Logic.\n    *   **Example 2 (Color 1 - Blue):** The texture corresponds to Pattern 2 where any pixel on a *separator* line is orange.\n        *   Logic: $7$ if $(S_r \\lor S_c)$, else $0$.\n        *   Mapping: Color 1 $\\to$ Logic 7 ($0111_2$). (Matches OR).\n    *   **Example 3 (Color 6 - Magenta):** The texture corresponds to Pattern 3 where pixels are orange if exactly one coordinate is a separator (lines crossing cells, but not intersections).\n        *   Logic: $7$ if $(S_r \\oplus S_c)$, else $0$.\n        *   Mapping: Color 6 $\\to$ Logic 6 ($0110_2$). (Matches XOR).\n    *   **Test Input (Color 2 - Red):** Following the pattern where even colors map to their integer value as a truth table (e.g., $6 \\to 6$), and odd colors map to something else, we infer Color 2 maps to Logic 2 ($0010_2$).\n        *   Logic 2 means the output is 7 only when state is $01_2$ (i.e., $S_r=0, S_c=1$? Or $S_r=1, S_c=0$?).\n        *   Based on consistency with other mappings, the state index is formed by $(S_c \\ll 1) | S_r$ or vice versa.\n            *   For Color 6 (XOR), order doesn't matter.\n            *   For Color 1 (OR), order doesn't matter.\n            *   For Color 3 ($!S_r \\land !S_c$), this is state 00 being 1.\n        *   If Color 2 implies Logic 2 ($0010_2$), only index 1 is high.

The core of the problem seems to be transforming a small 6x6 input grid into a larger 16x16 output grid. The outputs are always a 16x16 grid, and there are three solved examples. The key to the problem must be understanding the relationship between the small input and big output.\n\n**Example Analysis**\n\nThe examples show a pattern, with the background always being color 7. The inputs have small, uniquely shaped objects, with the corresponding output being a larger, structured image. Initially, I thought it was zooming but quickly realized it\u2019s more complex, as the outputs include a new color (9) not in the input.\n\n**Key Observations and Hypotheses**\n\n*   **Size Expansion:** The jump from 6x6 to 16x16 suggests some kind of tiling, replication or interpolation process.\n*   **Color 9:** The introduction of color 9 in the output is crucial, signifying a \"highlight\" or modification.\n*   **Grid Structure:** The outputs display a clear grid-like structure, but it's not a simple tiling. It's more complex, with variations depending on the input shape.\n*   **3x3 Subgrid:** After looking at several cases, it seems that there is a relevant 3x3 pattern inside the 6x6 input to make the output.\n\n**The Grid Structure**\n\nA detailed analysis of the output grid reveals it\u2019s a 5x5 array of blocks with single-pixel separators. These blocks are of size 2x2. The central 3x3 array is modified, whereas the rest of the array is simple. The pattern inside this center part seems related to the input shape.\n\n**Defining the Rules**\n\nThe goal is to understand how the 3x3 input pattern transforms into this 16x16 output. It's not a direct pixel-by-pixel mapping.\n\n1.  **Extract the Core:** The starting point is extracting a 3x3 subgrid from the input. It corresponds to the non-background pixels.\n\n2.  **Define a Base Grid**: An important point is to discover what the underlying output grid looks like. The idea is that it can be created and then modified according to the input. We will use the \u201cfundamental tile\u201d. This tile is the pattern for the lines and the blocks.\n\n3.  **Rotation Logic** The next hypothesis is that it could be used for the base grid. The base grid is constructed using a \u201cFundamental Tile\u201d of the top-left 2x2 of the Input Pattern, we also know that the FG is translated to 0 and the BG to 7. This base grid could be built by applying the rules:\n    *   Map the 2x2 input with 7=BG, FG=0.\n    *   Rotate the result 180 degrees.\n    *   The 2x2 grid then describes how to make the entire grid.\n\n4.  **Overlay Highlight:** The \"highlighting\" with color 9 is not random; it's a structural modification, so any 0 is replaced by a 9 in the center, and 7 stays unchanged. The core of the output is a \u201c0\u201d everywhere and 7 on the \u201clines\u201d, the highlight just replaces it.\n\n**Test Input**\n\nWith these rules in hand, all examples should be easily processed. By taking the test input, identifying a 3x3 square, then extracting the top-left 2x2. We can get the fundamental tile with the above logic.\n\n\nThe solution involves generating a 16x16 output grid based on a 3x3 pattern extracted from the input grid. The process determines a repeating \"Base Grid\" pattern and then applies a specific \"Overlay\" in the center.\n\n**1. Pattern Extraction**\nFirst, we identify the bounding box of the non-background pixels (non-7) in the 6x6 input grid.\nFor the **Test Input**, the non-7 pixels (color 2) are at `(0,2), (0,4), (2,2), (2,4)`.\nThis forms a 3x3 pattern `P` (Rows 0-2, Cols 2-4):\n```\n2 7 2\n7 7 7\n2 7 2\n```\nThe background is 7, and the foreground is 2.\n\n**2. Determining the Fundamental Tile**\nWe derive a 2x2 \"Fundamental Tile\" `T` from the **Top-Left 2x2** subgrid of the extracted pattern `P`.\nInput Top-Left 2x2:\n```\n2 7\n7 7\n```\nMap the colors to a binary scheme: Foreground (2) becomes `0`, Background (7) becomes `7`.\n```\n0 7\n7 7\n```\nRotate this 2x2 block by **180 degrees** to get `T`:\n```\n7 7\n7 0\n```\nSo, the components of `T` are:\n*   `T(0,0) = 7` (Intersection)\n*   `T(0,1) = 7` (Horizontal Line segment)\n*   `T(1,0) = 7` (Vertical Line segment)\n*   `T(1,1) = 0` (Block content)\n\n**3. Generating the Base Grid**\nWe construct a 16x16 grid. The grid structure consists of 1-pixel wide lines separating 2x2 blocks. Indices `0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15` correspond to \"Line\" rows/columns (index % 3 == 0). The other indices correspond to \"Block\" rows/columns.\nThe value of a pixel at `(r, c)` is determined by `T(r_type, c_type)`:\n*   `r_type = 0` if `r % 3 == 0`, else `1`.\n*   `c_type = 0` if `c % 3 == 0`, else `1`.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n*   **Intersections** (`r%3==0, c%3==0`): `T(0,0) = 7`\n*   **Horizontal Lines** (`r%3==0, c%3!=0`): `T(0,1) = 7`\n*   **Vertical Lines** (`r%3!=0, c%3==0`): `T(1,0) = 7`\n*   **Blocks** (`r%3!=0, c%3!=0`): `T(1,1) = 0`\n\nThis results in a grid of `0` blocks (2x2) separated by a complete lattice of `7`s.\nExample Row 0 (Line): `7, 7, 7, 7...` (All 7s)\nExample Row 1 (Block): `7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7...`\n\n**4. Applying the Overlay**\nA \"Highlight\" overlay is applied to the central region of the grid, specifically indices `5` to `10` (inclusive) for both rows and columns.\nRule: In this region, replace any pixel with value `0` with `9` (Maroon). Pixels with value `7` remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Rows 5, 7, 8, 10** are Block rows. The pattern is `...7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7...`\n    *   Indices 5-10: `0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0`.\n    *   Apply replacement: `9, 7, 9, 9, 7, 9`.\n*   **Rows 6, 9** are Line rows.

What *actually* happened?\"\n  3. **Verdict:** \"Do they match?\"\n- **Fatal Contradictions to Watch For:**\n  * **Scope Error:** Rule applies to specific colors (e.g., \"Blue\"), but the example changes \"Red\" pixels.\n  * **Geometry Error:** Rule says \"rotate 90,\" but example shows a flip.\n  * **Object Error:** Rule treats pixels individually, but example shows objects moving as blocks.\n- *Constraint:* Record exactly how many Solved Examples the candidate PASSED vs FAILED. **Do not stop at the first failure**; check all examples to determine the severity of the failure (e.g., \"Passed 2/3 Examples\").\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n- For Candidates that survived Phase 2 (or passed at least one example):\n- Look at the {{TEST_INPUT}} and the Candidate's <PROPOSED_SOLUTION> grid.\n- Does the proposed output actually follow the Crystallized Rule?\n- *Common Hallucination:* The text says \"Move Blue,\" but the grid shows Blue staying still. Mark this as **INTERNAL_CONTRADICTION**.\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING & TIE-BREAKING\n- Rank ALL candidates from Best to Worst based on this hierarchy:\n  1. **GOLD (Tier 1):** Passed ALL Solved Examples + Consistent Execution on Test Input.\n  2. **SILVER (Tier 2):** Passed ALL Solved Examples + Minor Execution Error on Test Input.\n  3. **BRONZE (Tier 3):** Passed MOST Solved Examples (Partial Logic).\n  4. **INVALID (Tier 4):** Failed ALL/MOST Solved Examples, Vague Reasoning, or Severe Internal Contradictions.\n\n- **Tie-Breaking:** If two candidates are in the same Tier, rank the one with the **Simplest Rule** (Occam's Razor) higher.\n</AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\n\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfit\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",

My initial focus is to analyze the input and output grids.\n\n**Input Grids**\n\nAll the input grids are 6x6. Each one has a background color, which is always orange (7), and another color which forms some kind of specific pattern. I'm going through each example, painstakingly writing out the color codes at specific coordinates, trying to grasp the visual logic. For the first example, I see a green plus shape.\n\nI'm thinking, \"Is there a relationship between the colors and shapes?\" The second input looks like a blue diamond or an 'H' shape, or is it more like corners and center? Let's check coordinates. I'm noting specific coordinates that define the shape.  The third has a magenta 'X'.\n\nI'm starting to consider how each input color/shape influences the output. I'm also carefully checking the test input. What's the pattern? Two red dots in the corners. Okay, it's starting to look like each input has a 3x3 pattern in a 6x6 grid. Maybe this local 3x3 pattern is the key.\n\n**Output Grids**\n\nI'm now switching to the output grids, and they're all 16x16. These are way bigger! I am observing how it might be constructed from smaller, repeating units. Are they 5x5 blocks? Maybe 3x3 scaled up? Let's look at the outputs... I see rows and columns of zeros, which suggests some kind of tiling or a grid structure. \n\nI'm getting closer, and it seems like the output is made of these repeating \"macro-pixels.\" Rows 0, 3, 6, etc., and columns 0, 3, 6, etc., have zeros. I\u2019m starting to think about horizontal and vertical \"grid lines\" that define these repeating macro-pixels. There are these bold maroon (color 9) patches in the middle that really pop out. The 9s form this rectangular region, it's probably the visual highlight. I see they are not in all locations. Okay, it's 5x5. The zeros act as separators! I will call these the grid lines.\n\n**Connecting Input and Output**\n\nNow, I'm trying to connect the dots between the input and output. The output seems to replicate a smaller grid from the input. What is the relation between the color in the inputs, and the shape or tile style in the output. The output grids seem to be made of 5x5 blocks. So, is there a 5x5 input to output correspondence? Each input seems to have a centered 3x3 pattern in each grid. I start comparing the input and output grids side by side. I'm seeing 7s in some output cells, and 0s in others. How is the tile color related to the colors in the input pattern? The output tiles have 7s, 0s and 9s. I can see 0s for the lines. I am realizing that maybe this 5x5 output is a zoomed-in representation of the 3x3 input pattern.\n\nI look closer at the 9s. The 9s seem to be in this kind of central frame around one of the cells. The 9's overwrite any other color. I think the 9s are always centered around a tile and only overwrite the center tile and one pixel on its adjacent tiles.\n\n**Discovering the Pattern**\n\nHere's my hypothesis: The output is a 5x5 grid of 2x2 blocks separated by 1-pixel lines. And, the key is this 3x3 region in the input, because that's what seems to define how the output is styled. And I realize, based on examples, there are a few texture styles. The style is not a one-to-one mapping, though. The colors of the grid lines vs the colors of the tiles. In some examples, the lines are black, tiles are orange; in others, the lines are orange, tiles are black.\n\nThis is my insight! The output grid texture is determined by the input 3x3 pattern. Let's look at the three examples, one-by-one! For instance, the horizontal and vertical lines will have specific colors. It appears that horizontal lines match with the horizontal mid-row pixels from the input, while vertical lines match with the vertical-mid col in the input.\n\nEx 1: If mid row is full (all 3 values of the color), then the output has Black horizontal lines. Same for the cols. If the tile has some pattern, the texture will be a tile\n\nThe transformation involves identifying a 3x3 pattern within the input grid and generating a 16x16 output grid based on specific features of that pattern. The output grid is a structured 5x5 array of 2x2 tiles separated by 1-pixel wide grid lines.\n\n**Logic derived from examples:**\n1.  **Pattern Extraction:**\n    -   Locate the 3x3 region in the 6x6 input that contains the colored pattern (non-7 values).\n    -   **Test Input Pattern:** The pattern is a 3x3 box formed by Red (2) pixels at the corners `(0,2), (0,4), (2,2), (2,4)`. The rest of the 3x3 area is empty (7).\n        -   Top Row: `2 7 2` (Corners filled)\n        -   Middle Row: `7 7 7` (Empty)\n        -   Bottom Row: `2 7 2` (Corners filled)\n        -   Middle Column: `7 7 7` (Empty)\n\n2.  **Determine Output Grid Style (Texture):**\n    -   The style of the grid lines (Horizontal/Vertical) and the Tiles depends on the fullness of the 3x3 pattern's rows/columns.\n    -   **Horizontal Lines:** If the Middle Row of the pattern is full (contains pattern colors), the lines are Black (0). If empty, they are Orange (7).\n        -   Test Middle Row is empty -> **Horizontal Lines = 7**.\n    -   **Vertical Lines:** If the Middle Column of the pattern is full, the lines are Black (0). If empty, they are Orange (7).\n        -   Test Middle Column is empty -> **Vertical Lines = 7**.\n    -   **Tiles:** If the pattern corners are filled, the tiles are Black (0). If empty, they are Orange (7).\n        -   Test Corners are filled -> **Tiles = 0**.\n    -   **Intersections:** Grid line intersections are always Black (0).\n\n3.  **Construct Base Grid:**\n    -   The grid is 16x16. Lines are at indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n    -   Based on the style determined:\n        -   **Intersections:** (0,0), (0,3)... are 0.\n        -   **Horizontal Segments:** (0,1), (0,2), (0,4)... are 7.\n        -   **Vertical Segments:** (1,0), (2,0), (4,0)... are 7.\n        -   **Tiles:** (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)... are 0.\n\n4.  **Apply Highlight Overlay:**\n    -   A highlight box is applied to the center of the grid, specifically covering the area from **rows 6 to 9** and **columns 5 to 10**.\n    -   **Rule:** In this region, any pixel that is Black (0) becomes Maroon (9). Pixels that are Orange (7) remain Orange (7).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\nThe Test Input pattern features (Empty Middle Row, Empty Middle Column, Filled Corners) match exactly with Example 3. Therefore, the output grid will be identical to the output of Example 3.\n\n**Output Grid generation:**\n-   **Rows 0, 3, 12, 15 (Base Lines):** `0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n-   **Rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 13, 14 (Base Tiles):** `7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n-   **Rows 6, 9 (Center Lines with Overlay):**\n    -   Base: `0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n    -   Overlay (cols 5-10): Change 0 to 9.\n    -   Result: `0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n-   **Rows 7, 8 (Center Tiles with Overlay):**\n    -   Base: `7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n    -   Overlay (cols 5-10): Change 0 to 9.\n    -   Result: `7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7`\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_3_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### What the examples show\n\n**1) The output is always a 16\u00d716 \u201cgrid of cells\u201d**\n- 16 comes from drawing a **5\u00d75 board** where each cell interior is **2\u00d72**, separated by **1-pixel-wide grid lines**:\n  \\[\n  5\\cdot 2\\;+\\;6\\cdot 1 \\;=\\; 16\n  \\]\n- Therefore the **grid-line indices** are every 3 cells:\n  - Rows: **1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16**\n  - Cols: **1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16**\n- Intersections of grid lines stay **0**.\n\n**2) The input decides which grid lines are drawn in color 7**\nIn each input, there is one \u201cobject\u201d color (not 7) inside a **3\u00d73 bounding box**.

The goal is to take a 6x6 input grid and transform it into a 16x16 output grid, and the transformation depends on a few factors. Let's break it down:\n\n**Input Analysis:** The input grids all have a dominant orange background (color 7) and a secondary pattern of a different color. I see the patterns as sort of a plus sign, a diamond, and an \"X,\" respectively, in the examples. Importantly, there are no overlaps in the patterns, and they are embedded within a larger array. The test input has 4 dots, which forms the corners of a square (::).\n\n**Output Structure:** The 16x16 output grids have a distinct grid-like structure. They are composed of a series of 2x2 \"tiles\" separated by single-pixel \"lines,\" creating a 5x5 array of tiles (where 5 * 3 + 1 = 16 pixels per side). I noticed that the color of these lines and tiles isn't random; it's a key part of the transformation.\n\n**Key Insight: The input pattern determines the output Style, not the content of each tile.** The core idea is that the output visually represents the presence of a pattern in the input (I was initially going down the path of trying to build the tiles based on pixel-by-pixel, and this was not the case). The important concept is the background/Tile Style and the Highlight shape. This is what changes based on the input pattern.\n\n**Style and Color Mapping:** There is a clear mapping between the secondary color in the input and the overall output style. The input color's \"style\" has 3 parts: H-lines, V-lines, and Tiles. The style is not a direct encoding but a code based on the binary bits of the color. In my examples:\n- Color 3 (Green) -> Tiles (Black lines, colored tile. Tiles=7, Lines=0).\n- Color 1 (Blue) -> Vertical Lines (Black tiles, color V-lines. Tiles=0, V-Lines=7).\n- Color 6 (Magenta) -> Grid (H and V Lines are color. Tiles=0, H-lines=7, V-lines=7).\n- Color 2 (Test-Red) -> Horizontal lines.\n\n**The Highlight (Center Box):** This is the final piece of the puzzle. There is a consistent \"highlight\" region in the output, always centered on the center tile (T(2,2)) of the 5x5 tile grid. This highlight is a 6x6 box, 0-indexed Cols 5-10, Rows 5-10. This 6x6 box replaces all 0 values with a highlight value (9), masking anything that is already 7. The highlight shape is *always* 6x6, and it overrides the style. It changes based on the Input Color/Style.\n\n**The output Highlight shape:** This *always* creates a 6x6 rectangle that visually expands from the center, creating a highlight, and the spill can vary based on the Style.\n\n**In summary:**\n1.  **Read the Input.**\n2.  **Determine the Output Style:** Identify which style to build based on the input pattern color.\n3.  **Construct the Base Grid:** Create the 16x16 grid with the base tile and line colors dictated by the selected output style.\n4.  **Apply the Highlight:** Always fill the 6x6 Highlight Box with color 9 *replacing* the underlying 0 value, not the 7 value, thus preserving the tile/line separation.\n5.  **Output the result.**\n\nThe critical aspect is understanding that the color of the tiles and lines in the output is linked directly to the color of the pattern in the input, not the pixel content. It's about a visual representation of presence, not a direct pixel-by-pixel copy or mapping of the image. The pattern in the input gives an indicator of the visual transformation which, in turn, is a visual grid style with a highlight.\n\n\nThe task requires inferring the transformation rule from 6x6 input grids to 16x16 output grids. The input grids contain a background of color 7 (orange) with a geometric pattern of another color. The output grids are stylized representations of a $5 \\times 5$ tile grid, where the style and a central highlight are determined by the input pattern's color.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Output Structure**: The output is always a $16 \\times 16$ grid representing $5 \\times 5$ tiles. Each tile is $2 \\times 2$ pixels, separated by 1-pixel wide grid lines.\n    *   Tiles correspond to rows/cols indices: 1-2, 4-5, 7-8, 10-11, 13-14.\n    *   Grid lines correspond to rows/cols indices: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n\n2.  **Base Style Determined by Input Pattern Color**:\n    *   **Color 3 (Green)** $\\to$ **Tiles Style**: Tiles are filled with color 7, lines are color 0. (Example 1)\n    *   **Color 1 (Blue)** $\\to$ **Vertical Lines Style**: Vertical grid lines are color 7, tiles and horizontal lines are color 0. (Example 2)\n    *   **Color 6 (Magenta)** $\\to$ **Grid Style**: Vertical and horizontal grid lines are color 7 (intersections are 0), tiles are color 0.

The user wants me to solve this ARC task, and it seems pretty straightforward once you break it down. I've got to create a 16x16 grid based on the provided examples and test input. The prompt hints strongly at the solution.\n\nFirst, I observe that all the inputs are 6x6 grids with a color 7 background (orange) and a distinct shape/glyph formed by a different color (1, 2, 3, or 6). I need to analyze how these glyphs dictate the structure of the 16x16 output grid. The outputs also have a repeating pattern with colors 0, 7, and 9. I also note the \"transformation description\" which is very useful.\n\n**Input Analysis and Lattice Structure:**\n\nI start by looking at the examples and identifying the core pattern. The inputs always have a single color that forms some sort of glyph against a constant background color. I deduce that the crucial element for the output is the presence of the lattice.\n\nAll the outputs are 16x16 grids. The critical element seems to be a lattice with a period of 3. This means horizontal and vertical lines at indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 (0-indexed). I will call these \"lattice lines\". These lines define a grid structure.\n\n**Color-Specific Lattice Rules:**\n\nI see that different input colors map to different lattice configurations:\n\n*   **Color 3 (Green) - Example 1:** \"Cells are 7\". The output grid looks like the lattice lines are black (0), and the cells are orange (7).\n*   **Color 1 (Blue) - Example 2:** \"Vertical lines 7\". Vertical lines are orange (7). Horizontal lines and cells are black (0).\n*   **Color 6 (Magenta) - Example 3:** \"All lines are 7\". Both vertical and horizontal lines are orange (7), so it makes an orange grid.\n\nI infer the crucial logic: each of the different colors will select parts of the lattice to be a different color.\n\n**Deduction for Test Input (Color 2, Red):**\n\nThe prompt doesn't explicitly define color 2. I need to figure out what pattern to apply. I look at the shape given in the test input. It consists of horizontal segments. I make the hypothesis that color 2 should be mapped to the horizontal lattice segments. I look for something orthogonal and complementary. Since Color 1 uses Vertical and Color 6 all lines, it logically follows that the Color 2 will be Horizontal lines.\n\n**Construction of the Output Grid:**\n\n1.  **Lattice definition:** I define the lattice structure based on indices divisible by 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15).\n2.  **Color 2 Transformation:** I apply the rule: Horizontal lattice segments are orange (7), and the rest is black (0).\n3.  **Central Highlight:** I apply the final part: highlight. There is a central 6x6 area (indices 5-10 for both rows and columns) where the 0s become 9.\n\n**Generated Grid:**\n\nI build the grid now.\nThe output has 16 rows and 16 columns (indices from 0-15):\n\n*   The lattice rows are: rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15. The horizontal lattice parts are 7. The non-lattice columns are 0.\n*   The non-lattice rows are the rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14. All elements are 0, except for those in the range of the central 6x6 highlight (rows 5 to 10 and columns 5 to 10), which are converted from 0 to 9.\n\nSo based on this logic, I construct the result.\n```\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0\n\nTo solve this problem, I will break down the transformation rules by analyzing the solved examples and applying the logic to the test input.\n\n### 1. Grid Structure and Lattice Definition\nThe output is always a 16x16 grid. The description and examples point to a lattice structure with a period of 3.\n- **Lattice Lines**: Rows and Columns at indices $0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15$.\n- **Lattice Intersections**: Points where both row and column indices are lattice lines (e.g., $(0,0), (3,6)$). These appear to always be color 0 (black).\n- **Lattice Segments**: Parts of a lattice line between intersections.\n  - **Horizontal Segments**: Row is a lattice line, Column is not.\n  - **Vertical Segments**: Column is a lattice line, Row is not.\n- **Cells**: Regions where neither row nor column are lattice lines (the 2x2 areas inside the mesh).\n\n### 2. Logic for Coloring the Lattice\nThe input glyph color determines which parts of the lattice pattern are colored 7 (orange). The rest is 0 (black).\n- **Example 1 (Color 3, Shape '+')**: The logic provided implies that lattice lines are 0 and cells are 7. This is an \"inverse\" lattice or simply filling the cells.\n- **Example 2 (Color 1, Shape 'H')**: Vertical lattice segments are colored 7. Everything else (Horizontal segments, Cells, Intersections) is 0. This matches the vertical nature of the 'H'.\n- **Example 3 (Color 6, Shape 'Diamond/X')**: Both Vertical and Horizontal lattice segments are colored 7. Cells and Intersections are 0. This matches the connected grid shape.\n\n**Inference for Test Input (Color 2)**:\nThe test input contains color 2. The shape appears to be two horizontal pairs of dots.\nGiven the set of transformations:\n- Vertical Segments = 7 (Color 1)\n- Vertical & Horizontal Segments = 7 (Color 6)\n- The missing logical component is **Horizontal Segments = 7**.\nTherefore, for Color 2, we apply the rule: **Horizontal lattice segments are 7, everything else is 0.**\n\n### 3. Central Highlight\nA specific region of the grid is highlighted by changing color 0 to color 9 (maroon). Color 7 is unaffected.\n- **Region**: \"Rows 6\u201311, cols 6\u201311\" in 1-based numbering corresponds to **indices 5\u201310** (0-based) inclusive. This creates a centered 6x6 area.\n\n### 4. Constructing the Output for Test Input (Color 2)\n\n**Step A: Generate Base Pattern (Horizontal Segments = 7)**\n- **Lattice Rows** (Indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15):\n  - Intersection columns (0, 3, 6...) are 0.\n  - Segment columns (1, 2, 4, 5...) are 7.\n  - Pattern: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n- **Non-Lattice Rows** (Indices 1, 2, 4, 5...):\n  - These contain no horizontal lattice segments.\n  - Pattern: All `0`s.\n\n**Step B: Apply Highlight (Indices 5\u201310)**\nWe modify the base pattern for rows 5 through 10, specifically at columns 5 through 10.\n- **Rows 5, 7, 8, 10** (Non-Lattice Rows):\n  - Base: All 0.\n  - Highlight: Zeros in columns 5\u201310 become 9.\n  - Result segment (cols 5-10): `9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9`.\n  - Full Row: `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`\n- **Rows 6, 9** (Lattice Rows):\n  - Base: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n  - Columns 5\u201310 values: `7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7`.\n  - Apply Highlight (0->9, 7->7): `7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7`.\n  - Full Row: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n\n**Step C: Compile Final Grid**\n- Rows 0, 3, 12, 15: Base Lattice Row.\n- Rows 1, 2, 4, 11, 13, 14: Base Non-Lattice Row (All 0).\n- Rows 5, 7, 8, 10: Highlighted Non-Lattice Row.\n- Rows 6, 9: Highlighted Lattice Row.\n\noutput:\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Okay, here's my thought process on this ARC task.**\n\nThe user wants me to solve an ARC task, and I need to figure out the pattern in three provided examples to determine how to apply the pattern to the test input. I'm an expert in this field so I have a lot of tools at my disposal.\n\nI start by breaking down each example. I focus on the relationship between the input grid (shape and its color) and the output 16x16 grid, paying close attention to any color changes or patterns.\n\n**Example 1**:\nI see a cross shape in the input, colored green (color 3). I notice that the output grid has a lattice-like pattern where specific cells are colored differently, and there's a 6x6 highlight in the center.\n\n- I meticulously examine coordinates to try and understand the lattice structure.  I determine that the cell value is 0 if either the row or column index is divisible by 3 and 7 otherwise (unless in the highlight region). The pattern seems to use a 0, 7 structure. The hint emphasizes the highlight region, showing it's cells should be converted to 9.\n\n**Example 2**:\nHere, the input has an \"H\" shape in blue (color 1). The output is again a 16x16 grid with a similar lattice structure and highlight.\n\n-  I study the pattern and deduce that it's different this time. I find that cells where the row index is NOT divisible by 3, and the column index IS divisible by 3, the value is 7. Otherwise is 0.\n- So, the pattern is: 0 if row divisible by 3, or if the column index is not divisible by 3, is 0. I notice vertical struts.\n\n**Example 3**:\nThis time, it is colored magenta (color 6). The shape is an 'X' (or a checkerboard).\n\n- I carefully analyze the output pattern. I determine that if either the row OR the column is a multiple of 3. the output is 0, except where both rows and columns are multiples of 3. Otherwise the value is 7.\n- I read the description closely to gain more info. I read the hint: \"6->7 where rLine XOR cLine\" in the prompt. This confirmed my understanding.\n\nI think about the connection between the shape color and the lattice structure. I see a pattern:\n\n- **Green (3)** maps to a standard lattice (0 at intersections, 7 elsewhere).\n- **Blue (1)** maps to a vertical-dominated lattice (7 only on vertical lines).\n- **Magenta (6)** maps to a lattice where horizontal and vertical lines are 7, excluding intersections/holes.\n\n**Test Input**:\nThe shape is red (color 2), and it looks like a collection of 4 dots in a box. I have to find the pattern for color 2. I have rules now for 1, 3, 6, and I can start to make a hypothesis based on prior knowledge.\n\nMy current theory: There must be a relationship based on vertical and horizontal lines. Since Blue is Vertical, I hypothesize that RED will be horizontal. This means that cells at multiples of 3 in the row must output a 7 when the column is not a multiple of 3. Otherwise, 0. I apply this. I create the base, the pattern for the grid that excludes the highlight region. The rule is for Color 2: $7$ if the row is divisible by 3, and the column is not divisible by 3. Otherwise, is 0.\n\nNow that I have the base pattern defined, I apply the highlight to the grid (rows 5-10, cols 5-10). Any 0 in this range becomes a 9.\n\nFinally, I write out the complete output grid in the specified format, ready to solve the user's request.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples and the provided description, here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Input Glyph and Color**:\n    The test input contains a shape made of color 2 (Red) against a background of 7. The shape consists of pixels at (0,2), (0,4), (2,2), (2,4), suggesting a horizontal alignment or relationship.\n\n2.  **Infer the Lattice Logic**:\n    The problem maps the glyph color to a specific logic for generating a 16x16 background lattice (lines at indices divisible by 3).\n    *   **Color 3 (Green)**: Sets the lattice lines (rows/cols divisible by 3) to 0, holes to 7. (Logic: 0 if RowLine OR ColLine).\n    *   **Color 1 (Blue)**: Sets vertical line segments to 7, everything else to 0. (Logic: 7 if ColLine AND NOT RowLine).\n    *   **Color 6 (Magenta)**: Sets both vertical and horizontal line segments to 7, intersections and holes to 0. (Logic: 7 if RowLine XOR ColLine).\n    *   **Color 2 (Red)**: By observing the pattern (1 is Vertical, 6 is Both, 3 is Inverted Both), Color 2 corresponds to **Horizontal line segments**. The logic is: assign 7 only on horizontal lattice lines excluding the intersections (where columns are also lattice lines), and 0 elsewhere.\n    \n    **Pattern for Color 2**:\n    *   **On Lattice Rows (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15)**: If the column is NOT a lattice column (indices 1, 2, 4, 5, etc.), the cell is 7.

Got it. Let's dig in. I'm seeing 6x6 input grids and bigger output grids. The input mostly has orange (7) with some other colored patterns.  I noticed the output seems to be this repeating tiling of larger grids.\n\nI'm starting to see that the output is always 16x16 and it's built of these 2x2 \"cells\" and 1-pixel-wide gaps. The 0s create the grid. There's a 5x5 array of 2x2 tiles. The inputs don't line up neatly with the output tile size. Noted, need to figure out the connection between 6x6 input and 5x5 tile array.\n\nThe input patterns aren't just random. They've got these specific shapes or patterns of colors. Green (3) is a plus, blue (1) an H-shape, and magenta (6) an X shape.  The test input is a square of red (2).\n\nNow, the output isn't a direct scaling of the input pattern. The 9s show up in this specific 5x5 region. The number 9 becomes key because it creates that highlight within the output. The background pattern in each example is something different.\n\nThere's this hypothesis that the 6x6 input is being mapped to a 5x5 tile array. The 6x6 input is not the same as the 5x5 output.  The output might be representing local neighborhoods of these \"special color\" shapes. Let's use the term *intrusion color* when referring to the non-orange pixels.\n\nI got curious about the *structure* of the output and how that related to the input grid. I had this idea that maybe the pixel values in the input are being \"blown up\", but the size mismatch, 6x6 and 16x16 doesn't quite work. I did notice that the outputs are either filled with all \"7\" or black with orange separators.\n\nIt appears the background or texture of each output is related to a property of the input.  One hypothesis. The texture of the output is determined by the \"intrusion color\", that's interesting.\n\nThe outputs have the central grid area (Indices 5-10) is always highlighted.  I'm calling the central highlighted block the \"9-box\". It seems the intrusion color determines *something* about the structure.\n\nA hypothesis is that the output grids represent the \"walls\" of a 5x5 grid or the intersections of those lines. This makes me consider a coordinate-based interpretation of the grid. It's like a lattice structure. The pattern of 7s and 0s relates to some pattern or code, related to `mod 3`.\n\nI had to backtrack.  I was trying to map each 3x3 input pattern onto a cell in the output and I just wasn't making it work.\n\nThe color (3) -> Background texture is based on the logic: if `x%3==0`, pixel is 0, else 7.  The texture is then applied to the output.\n\nThere seems to be an underlying structure based on the color's numerical value and the logic gate structure to define the background texture. These are: `!SepX && !SepY` and `SepX|SepY`, `SepX^SepY`, where I define `SepX` as the rows that are \"Separator\" rows and `SepY` as the Columns which are \"Separator\".\n\nColors -> Textures. Colors might map to a logic gate. A truth table. I need to figure out this connection between the color (3,1,6,2) and the logic (AND, OR, XOR). If the input texture is XOR, I use all 0s for the tiles and I draw in 7s around a grid shape.\n\nAfter lots of testing and hypotheses, I'm thinking the colors encode a 4-bit integer, which can be interpreted as a truth table. Then I define that the *logic* of the output depends on whether the 2D grid coordinate has its x and y coordinate, modulus 3, as a \"separator\" or \"cell\".\n\nThe color number encodes an output pattern according to the state (Sep/Cell, Sep/Cell) and the output is then encoded in the final pixel value.\n\n*   1 (Blue) translates to OR. `0111`.\n*   6 (Magenta) is XOR (0110).\n*   3 (Green) to the bitmask with value 3 (0011).\n\nThe final\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid.\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation involves the following logic:\n\n1.  **Output Structure:** The 16x16 output grid represents a 5x5 grid of 2x2 \"cells\" separated by 1-pixel wide lines (separators).\n    *   Separators are at indices $x, y \\in \\{0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15\\}$.\n    *   Cells are at the indices between separators.\n    *   The \"coordinates\" of a pixel $(r, c)$ can be described by whether it falls on a separator or in a cell. Let $S_r = (r \\% 3 == 0)$ and $S_c = (c \\% 3 == 0)$.\n\n2.  **Background Texture:** The input grid contains a pattern of a specific color (other than orange/7) against an orange background. This \"intrusion color\" determines the background texture of the output grid.\n    *   The texture is defined by a logic function determining whether a pixel is orange (7) or black (0).\n    *   **Example 1 (Color 3 - Green):** The texture corresponds to Pattern 1 where only pixels that are *inside cells* (both row and column are not separators) are orange.\n        *   Logic: $7$ if $(!S_r \\land !S_c)$, else $0$.\n        *   Mapping: Color 3 $\\to$ Truth Table Logic.\n    *   **Example 2 (Color 1 - Blue):** The texture corresponds to Pattern 2 where any pixel on a *separator* line is orange.\n        *   Logic: $7$ if $(S_r \\lor S_c)$, else $0$.\n        *   Mapping: Color 1 $\\to$ Logic 7 ($0111_2$). (Matches OR).\n    *   **Example 3 (Color 6 - Magenta):** The texture corresponds to Pattern 3 where pixels are orange if exactly one coordinate is a separator (lines crossing cells, but not intersections).\n        *   Logic: $7$ if $(S_r \\oplus S_c)$, else $0$.\n        *   Mapping: Color 6 $\\to$ Logic 6 ($0110_2$). (Matches XOR).\n    *   **Test Input (Color 2 - Red):** Following the pattern where even colors map to their integer value as a truth table (e.g., $6 \\to 6$), and odd colors map to something else, we infer Color 2 maps to Logic 2 ($0010_2$).\n        *   Logic 2 means the output is 7 only when state is $01_2$ (i.e., $S_r=0, S_c=1$? Or $S_r=1, S_c=0$?).\n        *   Based on consistency with other mappings, the state index is formed by $(S_c \\ll 1) | S_r$ or vice versa.\n            *   For Color 6 (XOR), order doesn't matter.\n            *   For Color 1 (OR), order doesn't matter.\n            *   For Color 3 ($!S_r \\land !S_c$), this is state 00 being 1.\n        *   If Color 2 implies Logic 2 ($0010_2$), only index 1 is high.

Initially, I thought it was zooming but quickly realized it\u2019s more complex, as the outputs include a new color (9) not in the input.\n\n**Key Observations and Hypotheses**\n\n*   **Size Expansion:** The jump from 6x6 to 16x16 suggests some kind of tiling, replication or interpolation process.\n*   **Color 9:** The introduction of color 9 in the output is crucial, signifying a \"highlight\" or modification.\n*   **Grid Structure:** The outputs display a clear grid-like structure, but it's not a simple tiling. It's more complex, with variations depending on the input shape.\n*   **3x3 Subgrid:** After looking at several cases, it seems that there is a relevant 3x3 pattern inside the 6x6 input to make the output.\n\n**The Grid Structure**\n\nA detailed analysis of the output grid reveals it\u2019s a 5x5 array of blocks with single-pixel separators. These blocks are of size 2x2. The central 3x3 array is modified, whereas the rest of the array is simple. The pattern inside this center part seems related to the input shape.\n\n**Defining the Rules**\n\nThe goal is to understand how the 3x3 input pattern transforms into this 16x16 output. It's not a direct pixel-by-pixel mapping.\n\n1.  **Extract the Core:** The starting point is extracting a 3x3 subgrid from the input. It corresponds to the non-background pixels.\n\n2.  **Define a Base Grid**: An important point is to discover what the underlying output grid looks like. The idea is that it can be created and then modified according to the input. We will use the \u201cfundamental tile\u201d. This tile is the pattern for the lines and the blocks.\n\n3.  **Rotation Logic** The next hypothesis is that it could be used for the base grid. The base grid is constructed using a \u201cFundamental Tile\u201d of the top-left 2x2 of the Input Pattern, we also know that the FG is translated to 0 and the BG to 7. This base grid could be built by applying the rules:\n    *   Map the 2x2 input with 7=BG, FG=0.\n    *   Rotate the result 180 degrees.\n    *   The 2x2 grid then describes how to make the entire grid.\n\n4.  **Overlay Highlight:** The \"highlighting\" with color 9 is not random; it's a structural modification, so any 0 is replaced by a 9 in the center, and 7 stays unchanged. The core of the output is a \u201c0\u201d everywhere and 7 on the \u201clines\u201d, the highlight just replaces it.\n\n**Test Input**\n\nWith these rules in hand, all examples should be easily processed. By taking the test input, identifying a 3x3 square, then extracting the top-left 2x2. We can get the fundamental tile with the above logic.\n\n\nThe solution involves generating a 16x16 output grid based on a 3x3 pattern extracted from the input grid. The process determines a repeating \"Base Grid\" pattern and then applies a specific \"Overlay\" in the center.\n\n**1. Pattern Extraction**\nFirst, we identify the bounding box of the non-background pixels (non-7) in the 6x6 input grid.\nFor the **Test Input**, the non-7 pixels (color 2) are at `(0,2), (0,4), (2,2), (2,4)`.\nThis forms a 3x3 pattern `P` (Rows 0-2, Cols 2-4):\n```\n2 7 2\n7 7 7\n2 7 2\n```\nThe background is 7, and the foreground is 2.\n\n**2. Determining the Fundamental Tile**\nWe derive a 2x2 \"Fundamental Tile\" `T` from the **Top-Left 2x2** subgrid of the extracted pattern `P`.\nInput Top-Left 2x2:\n```\n2 7\n7 7\n```\nMap the colors to a binary scheme: Foreground (2) becomes `0`, Background (7) becomes `7`.\n```\n0 7\n7 7\n```\nRotate this 2x2 block by **180 degrees** to get `T`:\n```\n7 7\n7 0\n```\nSo, the components of `T` are:\n*   `T(0,0) = 7` (Intersection)\n*   `T(0,1) = 7` (Horizontal Line segment)\n*   `T(1,0) = 7` (Vertical Line segment)\n*   `T(1,1) = 0` (Block content)\n\n**3. Generating the Base Grid**\nWe construct a 16x16 grid. The grid structure consists of 1-pixel wide lines separating 2x2 blocks. Indices `0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15` correspond to \"Line\" rows/columns (index % 3 == 0). The other indices correspond to \"Block\" rows/columns.\nThe value of a pixel at `(r, c)` is determined by `T(r_type, c_type)`:\n*   `r_type = 0` if `r % 3 == 0`, else `1`.\n*   `c_type = 0` if `c % 3 == 0`, else `1`.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n*   **Intersections** (`r%3==0, c%3==0`): `T(0,0) = 7`\n*   **Horizontal Lines** (`r%3==0, c%3!=0`): `T(0,1) = 7`\n*   **Vertical Lines** (`r%3!=0, c%3==0`): `T(1,0) = 7`\n*   **Blocks** (`r%3!=0, c%3!=0`): `T(1,1) = 0`\n\nThis results in a grid of `0` blocks (2x2) separated by a complete lattice of `7`s.\nExample Row 0 (Line): `7, 7, 7, 7...` (All 7s)\nExample Row 1 (Block): `7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7...`\n\n**4. Applying the Overlay**\nA \"Highlight\" overlay is applied to the central region of the grid, specifically indices `5` to `10` (inclusive) for both rows and columns.\nRule: In this region, replace any pixel with value `0` with `9` (Maroon). Pixels with value `7` remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Rows 5, 7, 8, 10** are Block rows. The pattern is `...7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7...`\n    *   Indices 5-10: `0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0`.\n    *   Apply replacement: `9, 7, 9, 9, 7, 9`.\n*   **Rows 6, 9** are Line rows. The pattern is all `7`s.\n    *   No `0`s to replace. They remain all `7`s.\n\n**Final Output Construction:**\n*   **Rows 0, 3, 12, 15:** All `7`s.\n*   **Rows 6, 9:** All `7`s (Unchanged by overlay).\n*   **Rows 1, 2, 4, 11, 13, 14:** `7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7`.\n*   **Rows 5, 7, 8, 10:** `7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 9, 7, 9, 9, 7, 9, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7`.\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_9_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"D\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_11_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### What the examples show\n\nEach input is a 6\u00d76 grid with a dominant background color **7** and a small \u201csymbol\u201d made of another color.  \nIn every solved output (always **16\u00d716**) there are two independent parts:\n\n1) **A periodic background made only of 0 and 7**  \n   -

It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
