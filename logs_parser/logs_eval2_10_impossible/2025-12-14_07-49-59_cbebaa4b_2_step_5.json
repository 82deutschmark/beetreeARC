            "Full raw LLM response": "**1. Problem Breakdown and Initial Analysis:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task, likely involving transforming input grids into output grids. My initial thought is to analyze input/output pairs to figure out the rule.  I'm seeing a lot of shapes, different colors, and most importantly, red (color 2) pixels. These red pixels seem to be the key, perhaps acting as \"connectors\" or defining relationships between the shapes.  My first example shows shapes moving around, almost like a physics simulation or a puzzle-solving scenario. The red pixels are scattered around, but they're always *near* or *within* shapes. This suggests that the arrangement of these shapes is dependent on those red pixels.\n\n**2. Hypothesis Formation:  \"Red = Glue\"**\n\nAs I examine Example 1 further, it becomes clearer.  There are these clusters of shapes and it seems that red pixels indicate *how* these shapes should be connected. They appear to overlap in the output. I'm starting to think the primary rule is that the red pixels need to \"match up\" or, maybe they are acting like glue, creating connections between shapes. The examples definitely have a \"puzzle\" feel to them.\n\n**3. Pattern Recognition and Refinement of the \"Glue\" Rule:**\n\nI see that the red pixels aren't just overlapping; the geometry of how they overlap matters. In the first example, the green and teal shapes appear to snap together because their red pixels are *aligned*. I start to see a \"rule\" emerge: Connect shapes by overlapping their red (2) pixels.  I also notice that it\u2019s not just about overlapping, but making sure the red pixels that *belong* to a specific shape are actually matched to other red pixels belonging to a DIFFERENT shape. The orientation of the pieces doesn't change \u2013 no rotation or flipping observed.\n\n**4. Verification and Generalization of the Rule:**\n\nI need to confirm that my red-pixel-as-glue theory holds for other examples. I go to Example 2 and start breaking down its components. There are multiple colored shapes with various connector arrangements. The rule remains consistent - the red pixels act as points to overlap and connect shapes to build one cluster.\n\n**5. Developing a General Algorithm:**\n\nBased on my observations, the general method that emerges: First, identify shapes by finding connected groups of non-black pixels plus adjacent red pixels. Then, figure out how these shapes connect to each other by identifying the matching geometry of the red pixels (connection sites). Next, determine the relative positions of each shape by overlapping the red pixels. In the end, I check the output to place everything in the right spot and generate the final output grid.  The steps are something like:\n1. Identify all shapes (color + nearby 2s).\n2. Connect shapes by overlapping their red pixels.\n3. Keep the same object\u2019s orientation.\n4. All the 2s must participate.\n\n**6. Applying the Rule to a Test Input:**\n\nI then start applying this method to the given test input. I start segmenting the objects, listing their colors and locations. I carefully note the red pixel connector sites for all of them. After all this information has been carefully obtained, I start matching all of the connectors and laying out a possible arrangement.\n\n**7. Coordinate System & Grid Construction:**\n\nTo place the shape in the output, I create a center point for it based on grid size calculations for an example. Then I start building the result grid from the identified components. I have to make sure to follow the pixel coordinates to correctly place all the shapes and all the colored blocks in the right locations! The output grid is then generated.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid by identifying distinct objects and assembling them into a single connected structure. The \"connectivity\" is defined by Red (2) pixels, which act as connectors or \"snaps\". Objects must be translated so that their connectors overlap with compatible connectors of other objects. The relative orientation of the objects remains fixed.\n\nBased on the analysis of the test input, we identified 7 objects (A-G) and their specific connection points:\n\n1.  **Object A (Teal 8)**: An inverted U-shape.\n    *   Top connector: Fits Object E.\n    *   Right connectors (pair): Fits Object G.\n    *   Bottom Legs (Left and Right): Fit Object C.\n2.  **Object E (Green 3, small)**: A vertical line.\n    *   Bottom connector: Fits Object A's top.\n3.  **Object G (Green 3, large)**: A complex shape.\n    *   Left connectors (pair): Fits Object A's right.\n    *   Top connectors (pair): Fits Object D.\n4.  **Object D (Grey 5)**: A rectangular block.\n    *   Bottom connectors (pair): Fits Object G's top.\n5.  **Object C (Yellow 4)**: A 3x3 box with connectors on all sides.\n    *   Top & Left connectors: Fit Object A's Right & Left legs respectively (bridging the legs).\n    *   Right connector: Fits Object F's top.\n6.  **Object F (Blue 1)**: A U-shaped container.\n    *   Top connector: Fits Object C's right.\n    *   Bottom connectors (pair): Fits Object B.\n7.  **Object B (Teal 6)**: A U-shape.\n    *   Top connectors (pair): Fits Object F's bottom.\n\n**Assembly Logic:**\n*   **Main Cluster:** E sits on A. A connects to G (right). D sits on G.\n*   **Lower Cluster:** C connects to the bottom of A (bridging its legs). F connects to the right of C. B hangs from the bottom of F.\n*   **Positioning:** The entire assembly is centered in the grid. Based on bounding box calculations, we anchor Object A (Teal 8) such that its top-left '8' pixel is at (7, 7).\n\n**Computed Coordinates:**\n*   **D (Grey 5):** Top-left at (2, 12).\n*   **E (Green 3):** Top at (3, 7).\n*   **G (Green 3):** Top connectors at row 6. Main body starts row 7.\n*   **A (Teal 8):** Top-left '8' at (7, 7).\n*   **C (Yellow 4):** Top-left '4' at (12, 8). (Connectors bridge A's legs).\n*   **F (Blue 1):** Top connector at (14, 11). Body starts row 14.\n*   **B (Teal 6):** Top connectors at row 19. Body starts row 20.\n\nThe final grid is constructed by placing these objects at the calculated offsets.

            "Full raw LLM response": "The logic for solving this task involves a hierarchical decomposition of the input grid into distinct objects, identification of connection points (\"ports\"), and reassembling the objects into a single connected structure based on matching ports.\n\n**1. Object Decomposition & Port Identification:**\nWe identify seven distinct objects in the input grid. Each object consists of a colored shape (non-black, non-red) and associated red (`2`) pixels that act as ports.\n\n*   **Object 1 (Teal `8`):** A hollow box shape.\n    *   Ports: Top (Single `2`), Right (Double `2`s), Bottom (Complex `2`s at corners).\n*   **Object 2 (Pink `6`):** A U-shape or cradle.\n    *   Ports: Top (Double `2`s).\n*   **Object 3 (Yellow `4`):** A cross-like hub.\n    *   Ports: Top (Single `2`), Left (Single `2`), Right (Single `2`), Bottom (Single `2`).\n*   **Object 4 (Green `3`):** A vertical pole.\n    *   Ports: Bottom (Single `2`).\n*   **Object 5 (Gray `5`):** A U-shape block.\n    *   Ports: Bottom (Double `2`s).\n*   **Object 6 (Blue `1`):** An L-shaped hook.\n    *   Ports: Top-Left (Single `2`), Bottom (Double `2`s).\n*   **Object 7 (Green/Orange `3`):** A complex shape.\n    *   Ports: Top (Double `2`s), Left (Single `2`).\n\n**2. Assembly Logic (Port Matching):**\nWe reconstruct the assembly by connecting compatible ports. A connection is valid if the spatial configuration (relative positions) of the `2`s matches.\n\n*   **Center:** The **Yellow Object** acts as the central hub.\n*   **Top Connection:** The **Teal Object** sits on top of the Yellow Object. Specifically, the Teal Object's bottom ports (two `2`s at bottom corners) align perfectly with the Yellow Object's Top and Left ports. This locks the Teal Object into the Top-Left corner of the Yellow hub.\n*   **Left Connection:** The **Green Pole** stands on top of the Teal Object. The Pole's bottom `2` connects to the Teal Object's top `2`.\n*   **Right Connection:** The **Gray Object** sits on top of the **Green/Orange Object** (Gray Bottom `2`s match Green Top `2`s). This combined block connects to the right of the Yellow hub: The Green Object's Left `2` connects to the Yellow Object's Right `2`.\n*   **Bottom Connection:** The **Blue Object** sits on top of the **Pink Object** (Blue Bottom `2`s match Pink Top `2`s). This combined block connects to the bottom of the Yellow hub: The Blue Object's Top `2` connects to the Yellow Object's Bottom `2`.\n\n**3. Final Construction:**\nWe calculate the rigid transformations (shifts) for each object to satisfy these connections and center the final assembly in the 26x26 grid.\n\n*   **Pole:** Shifts to position `(2,7)` (Top-left of Pole).\n*   **Teal:** Shifts to position `(5,7)` (Top port of Teal).\n*   **Yellow:** Shifts to position `(11,8)` (Center of Yellow).\n*   **Gray:** Shifts to position `(8,12)`.\n*   **Green:** Shifts to position `(13,12)`.\n*   **Blue:** Shifts to position `(14,10)`.\n*   **Pink:** Shifts to position `(19,7)`.\n\nThe final grid is populated by rendering each object at its calculated position. Red connection pixels (`2`) are included at the interfaces and exposed terminals.\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode.

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**I've got this!** The task is to take these scattered shapes and connect them. I'm seeing \"connectors,\" the red pixels, act like magnets. The yellow square is the central hub, and everything else snaps onto it. Example 1 is my key, and the test is a way to make sure the core idea works.\n\nThe input gives me the individual objects, each with its red connectors, and their shapes. The output shows them all linked up. It's about matching connectors from the input shapes to the connectors on the hub, which is the yellow square.\n\nI've worked out the process - I think I need to \"map the connectors\". The red pixels \"2\" at the ends of U-shapes must overlap other `2`s in the connected structure.  So, I examine how a red pixel on one shape meets another to create the connection.  No rotation, just shifts and connections.\n\nThe tricky part is translating between the text and the shapes. I have to look at each shape in the input, read the array of numbers, and visually build it up to see where the `2` connectors are. Then, I have to see how it moves to create the output image.\n\nThe Blue, Cyan, Green and Grey are like puzzle pieces. Each has red pixels that act like the puzzle knobs.  The yellow square has red port holes. Pieces can overlap at their red connectors.\n\nThe Test Input is next. I am now certain that the solution uses the overlaps of `2`s to connect.\n\nThen I examined each shape from the Test input.\n\nI think I see it. It is all about the red pixels, and how they touch. I'll take the Yellow square as the anchor point. Then match up the shapes and their pixel connections, shifting and placing.\n\nI had to be absolutely sure, so I painstakingly checked all the pieces. I did this in my mind, working through all the pieces and all the connectors and all the placements.\n\nFinally, I got the mapping for the Test case. With the input shapes and the shift to each shape.\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we need to assemble scattered objects into a single connected structure. The key to the solution is identifying the red pixels (value 2) as \"connectors\" or \"ports\". Each object has specific connector locations. The central object is the Yellow square, and other objects attach to it or to each other by overlapping their red connectors.\n\n**Analysis of the Objects in the Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Yellow Square (4)**: Located centrally at Rows 10-12, Cols 10-12.\n    *   It has 4 ports (red pixels):\n        *   **Left Port**: `(10, 9)` (Top of left side)\n        *   **Top Port**: `(9, 12)` (Right of top side)\n        *   **Bottom Port**: `(13, 11)` (Center of bottom side)\n        *   **Right Port**: `(12, 13)` (Bottom of right side)\n    *   This object acts as the anchor. We will calculate the target positions of other objects relative to this one (Shift `0,0`).\n\n2.  **Cyan Object (8)**: Located at Top-Left.\n    *   It has a boxy C-shape.\n    *   Connectors:\n        *   **Bottom-Left Leg**: `(6, 3)`\n        *   **Bottom-Right Leg**: `(5, 6)`\n        *   **Right Side**: `(1, 7)` and `(3, 7)`\n        *   **Top-Left**: `(0, 3)`\n    *   **Connection**: The Bottom legs match the Yellow square's Top and Left ports.\n        *   Cyan Bottom-Left Leg `(6, 3)` connects to Yellow Left Port `(10, 9)`.\n        *   Cyan Bottom-Right Leg `(5, 6)` connects to Yellow Top Port `(9, 12)`.\n        *   **Shift**: `(+4, +6)`.\n\n3.  **Green Stick (3)**: Located at Left (Row 11).\n    *   Vertical line of 3s.\n    *   Connector: **Bottom** at `(14, 4)`.\n    *   **Connection**: Connects to the Top-Left connector of the Cyan object.\n        *   Target: Cyan Top-Left `(0, 3)` shifted by `(+4, +6)` -> `(4, 9)`.\n        *   **Shift**: `(4, 9) - (14, 4) = (-10, +5)`.\n\n4.  **Green Comb (3)**: Located at Bottom-Right (Rows 20-24).\n    *   E-shape facing left.\n    *   Connectors: **Left** side at `(21, 10)` and `(23, 10)`. **Top** side at `(20, 12)` and `(20, 15)`.\n    *   **Connection**: Connects to the Right side of the Cyan object.\n        *   Target: Cyan Right connectors `(1, 7)` and `(3, 7)` shifted by `(+4, +6)` -> `(5, 13)` and `(7, 13)`.\n        *   Green Comb Left `(21, 10)` maps to `(5, 13)`.\n        *   **Shift**: `(5, 13) - (21, 10) = (-16, +3)`.\n\n5.  **Grey Object (5)**: Located at Right (Row 11-15).\n    *   U-shape facing down.\n    *   Connectors: **Bottom** tips at `(15, 19)` and `(15, 22)`.\n    *   **Connection**: Connects to the Top of the Green Comb.\n        *   Target: Green Comb Top `(20, 12)` and `(20, 15)` shifted by `(-16, +3)` -> `(4, 15)` and `(4, 18)`.\n        *   Grey Bottom `(15, 19)` maps to `(4, 15)`.\n        *   **Shift**: `(4, 15) - (15, 19) = (-11, -4)`.\n\n6.  **Blue Object (1)**: Located at Bottom-Left (Rows 19-24).\n    *   U-shape facing up.\n    *   Connectors: **Top Tips** at `(20, 2)` and `(19, 4)`. **Bottom Corners** at `(24, 2)` and `(24, 6)`.\n    *   **Connection**: Connects to the Bottom and Right ports of the Yellow Square.\n        *   Blue Top-Left Tip `(20, 2)` maps to Yellow Bottom Port `(13, 11)`.\n        *   Blue Top-Right Tip `(19, 4)` maps to Yellow Right Port `(12, 13)`.\n        *   **Shift**: `(13, 11) - (20, 2) = (-7, +9)`.\n\n7.  **Magenta Object (6)**: Located at Top-Right (Rows 3-6).\n    *   U-shape facing up.\n    *   Connectors: **Top Tips** at `(3, 18)` and `(3, 22)`.\n    *   **Connection**: Connects to the Bottom of the Blue Object.\n        *   Target: Blue Bottom connectors `(24, 2)` and `(24, 6)` shifted by `(-7, +9)` -> `(17, 11)` and `(17, 15)`.\n        *   Magenta Top `(3, 18)` maps to `(17, 11)`.\n        *   **Shift**: `(17, 11) - (3, 18) = (+14, -7)`.\n\n**Construction:**\nWe create a blank grid and draw each object at its calculated position. The connectors (red 2s) overlap perfectly to form the joints.\n\n*   **Yellow**: Stays at `(10,10)`.\n*   **Cyan**: Moves Right 4, Down 6.\n*   **Green Stick**: Moves Left 10, Down 5.\n*   **Green Comb**: Moves Left 16, Down 3.\n*   **Grey**: Moves Left 11, Up 4.\n*   **Blue**: Moves Left 7, Down 9.\n*   **Magenta**: Moves Right 14, Up 7.\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Thoughts on Solving This ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here we go. The user wants me to tackle another ARC problem based on examples. The first thing I notice is the grid size. These are big grids, around 22x22 or larger. They all have black backgrounds and colored shapes, which I can call \"objects.\" There's also this recurring yellow 3x3 square, which seems to be the central \"hub\" with red \"ports\" on its sides. Other objects are various colored shapes with their own red ports, and the output is just a rearrangement and connection of these objects.\n\nLooking at Example 1, it's clear this is about connecting those red \"ports\" from different shapes. I've got to figure out the rules for the transformations. Okay, first object is the yellow hub. Then there are other objects that get connected in the output in a nice-looking way. It seems the red pixels are the crucial indicators of connection. So, I need to look closely at object geometry, including their port coordinates, to see how they fit and join.\n\nIn Example 1, the shapes are arranged around a yellow central hub. The red pixels at the edges seem to be the connection points. Let's start breaking down the input grid. I'll describe it in terms of the objects I'm seeing: a yellow hub, a blue C-shape, a light blue \"bridge,\" a green inverted-U, and a grey 'C' shape. For each object, the description will include the ports (where the red pixels are) and then translate this into their mathematical properties. This means, coordinates! I will need to be careful with indexing the positions because I want to describe them precisely. The goal is to determine the shape transformation and how these shapes connect to each other. So that means careful analysis, in terms of x and y and how to move these around.\n\nFirst, the Yellow Hub. I can see the central 3x3 yellow block, with the ports at the middle of its sides. So I think these are the critical points. Let me see where they all are. I'm using the input grid to determine their coordinates and looking closely at the port's positions.\n\nNext, I look at the other objects, I carefully trace their shapes and identify the red pixels, which are the connectors. After some analysis, it looks like there's a blue 'U' shape, a \"light blue table,\" an \"inverted U\" that is green, and a sort of a \"hook\" shape. I can use the same approach to accurately describe these.\n\nNow, let's analyze the output. The output grid shows these objects all connected. I have the yellow hub, and everything is connected to it. The red pixels are still there, indicating the connection. By tracing the connections, I'm attempting to link these shapes with their ports. The order of the connection seems crucial here. I want to see if the connections are geometric or can also include other translations and rotations.\n\nLooking at the output in more detail, I need to see how each object fits around the hub, checking to see where the ports are, and what direction the shape goes. I have to see how object ports match the hub ports, and what kind of transformations are needed to make them fit.\n\nLet's carefully trace the objects again. Now, it seems like the light blue \"bridge\" is connected to the top of the hub, and the green \"inverted U\" is near it. I can look in the output for a trace of where these objects are to confirm the connection positions.\n\nI will attempt to translate and visualize this. Does one object need to rotate to fit into the next one? Does the shape flip to match? Does the port act as some kind of anchor? I've got to find a connection logic here. Let's see if there's a pattern, a rule.\n\nGoing through the output again, by checking the pixels, it seems like there are connections between other objects, beyond just the hub. The shapes look like they are connecting to each other in some kind of sequence. It's like a chain or a tree. In this arrangement, I can use the port's positions to try to understand how these objects connect.\n\nIt also looks like the red pixels are *still* there, but at the connecting points. This could mean these pixels are a part of the shape, indicating where the connections are made. It's like I have to \"match\" these ports. Okay, so ports need to be \"compatible.\"\n\nI now have a few hypotheses. First, objects link together, either directly or through intermediate shapes. Second, the red ports are the connecting points. Third, I have to match the port geometry. And lastly, there are other constraints like not overlapping the objects and grid continuity.\n\nOkay, let's attempt to go step-by-step. I'\n\nTo solve this task, I first identified the components and their connectivity based on the \"ports\" (red pixels, value 2).\n\n**Analysis of the Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Hub (Yellow 4):** Located at rows 10-12, columns 10-12.\n    *   It has 4 ports:\n        *   Left: (10,9)\n        *   Top: (9,12)\n        *   Right: (12,13)\n        *   Bottom: (13,11)\n\n2.  **Object 8 (Light Blue):** Located at the top-left (rows 0-6, cols 3-7).\n    *   Shape: 'C' facing right.\n    *   Ports:\n        *   Top: (0,3) - Single port.\n        *   Right side: (1,7) and (3,7) - Vertical spacing 2.\n        *   Bottom side: (6,3) and (5,6) - Staggered.

Formula: `(new_row, new_col) = (32 - row, 15 - col)`.\n        *   Mapping: (20,2) -> (12,13) [Hub Right], (19,4) -> (13,11) [Hub Bottom].\n\n6.  **Object 6 (Grey):** Located at top-right (rows 3-6, cols 18-22).\n    *   Shape: 'U' facing up.\n    *   Ports: Top (3,18) and (3,22) - Spacing 4.\n    *   **Connection:** Matches Blue's transformed bottom ports.\n        *   Blue's bottom ports (24,2) and (24,6) transform to (8,13) and (8,9).\n        *   Grey 6's (3,18) maps to (8,9) and (3,22) to (8,13).\n        *   Transformation: Translation by (+5 rows, -9 cols).\n\n**Step-by-step Construction:**\n\n1.  **Hub**: Copy pixels from Input (10,10)-(12,12) to Output (10,10)-(12,12).\n2.  **Object 8**: Apply `(r, c) -> (r+4, c+6)` to all pixels of Object 8.\n3.  **Object 3**: Apply `(r, c) -> (r-16, c+3)` to all pixels of Object 3.\n4.  **Object 5**: Apply `(r, c) -> (r-11, c-4)` to all pixels of Object 5.\n5.  **Object 1**: Apply `(r, c) -> (32-r, 15-c)` to all pixels of Object 1.\n6.  **Object 6**: Apply `(r, c) -> (r+5, c-9)` to all pixels of Object 6.\n\nAll connecting \"port\" pixels (value 2) are included in the object transformations and naturally overlap at the connection points.\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,2,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,8,0,0,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,2,4,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "All non\u2011zero cells form separate \u201cparts\u201d.  Color **2** cells are special: they are **connectors**.  \nThe task is to **assemble** the parts by **translation only** (no rotation), so that connectors from different parts **land on the same grid cells** (overlap).  Non\u2011connector colored cells must **never overlap**.  \nIn both solved examples the **3\u00d73 yellow block (color 4)** stays fixed and acts as the anchor; the other parts move to match its connectors, then remaining free connectors are matched part\u2011to\u2011part.\n\n### Steps used on the test grid\n1. **Find all parts** as connected components of non\u2011zero cells (including their red connector cells).\n2. Keep the **3\u00d73 block of 4s** fixed.\n3. Use **connector geometry** (relative offsets between connector cells) to decide which parts must join:\n   - The anchor has 4 connectors; we look for a part that has a pair of connectors with the same offset as a pair on the anchor, so it can lock in place by matching **two connectors at once**.\n4. In the test:\n   - The **blue (1) part** has two connectors with offset **(1,\u22122)**, matching the anchor\u2019s connector pair at **(12,13)** and **(13,11)** \u2192 place the blue part so those overlap.\n   - The **azure (8) part** has a connector pair with offset **(1,\u22123)**, matching the anchor\u2019s pair at **(9,12)** and **(10,9)** \u2192 place the 8\u2011part so those overlap.\n   - The **large green (3) part** has two left connectors with offset **(2,0)**, matching two right\u2011side connectors on the placed 8\u2011part \u2192 attach it there.\n   - The **gray (5) frame part** has two bottom connectors with offset **(0,3)**, matching two top connectors on the placed large green part \u2192 attach it above.\n   - The **small green (3) stick** has a single bottom connector; it matches the remaining top connector of the 8\u2011part \u2192 attach it above.\n   - The **magenta (6) cup** has two top connectors with offset **(0,4)**, matching the two remaining bottom connectors of the blue part \u2192 attach it below.\n5.

            "Full raw LLM response": "### What the transformation does (inferred from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find the \u201canchor\u201d object:**  \n   In every puzzle there is a solid **3\u00d73 block of color 4**. This block **does not move**.\n\n2. **Treat every other non\u2011zero connected component as a movable \u201cpiece\u201d:**  \n   Each piece is made of one main color (e.g. 8,6,5,3,1) plus some **red connector pixels (color 2)** attached to it.\n\n3. **Assemble the pieces by overlapping connector pixels (color 2):**  \n   Pieces are **translated only** (no rotation, no scaling) so that:\n   - **Every connector pixel (2) overlaps exactly one connector pixel (2) from another piece**.\n   - Main colored pixels never overlap.\n   - The final result is one assembled structure, with the anchor (4-block) staying in place.\n   \n   In the examples, this is exactly why the number of red pixels in the output is half the number of red pixels in the input: they are paired by overlap.\n\n4. **How to know which connectors match:**  \n   The correct pairing is determined by matching **connector patterns** (e.g. two connectors with the same spacing must overlap two connectors with that same spacing). This uniquely fixes each piece\u2019s translation relative to the fixed 4-block and already-placed pieces.\n\n---\n\n### Applying it to the test\n\n- Keep the 3\u00d73 **4-block** fixed.\n- Attach the other pieces by matching their connector spacing patterns, resulting in a unique assembled layout.\n- Render the union of all translated pieces on an otherwise-zero grid.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid (26\u00d726)\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1. There's a central 3x3 yellow (4) square that acts as an anchor\n2. Various colored shapes are scattered around with red (2) markers indicating connection points\n3. In the output, all shapes are assembled/connected around the yellow square, with red markers showing where they join\n4. Shapes move to connect via their red markers to form a cohesive structure\n\n**For the test input:**\n- Yellow (4) square is at rows 10-12, cols 10-12 with markers at (9,12), (10,9), (12,13), (13,11)\n- Cyan (8) shape connects from above via its bottom marker\n- Orange (6) connects to the right of cyan\n- Small green (3) vertical bar connects to yellow's left\n- Large green (3) horizontal bars connect below yellow\n- Blue (1) L-shape connects to large green's left\n- Pink (5) rectangle connects to large green's right/top\n\n**Calculating shifts:**\n- Cyan: shift (+3, +9) to connect bottom marker to yellow's top\n- Orange: shift (+1, -1) to connect to cyan's right\n- Small green: shift (-4, +5) to connect to yellow's left\n- Large green: shift (-7, -1) to connect to yellow's bottom\n- Blue: shift (-8, +3) to connect to large green's left\n- Pink: shift (-2, -4) to connect to large green's top\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,4,4,4,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,4,4,4,2,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,2,2,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Problem Decomposition and Solution Strategy for ARC Task**\n\nI'm tackling an ARC problem where I'm given two examples of input/output grids and a new test input grid. My goal is to figure out the rule that transforms the input to the output.\n\n**Understanding the Core Concepts:**\n\n1. **Grid Environment:** The grids are 2D arrays with integers representing colors (0 is black/background). The key is that we have disconnected shapes in the input which become connected in the output.\n2. **Object Identification:** The inputs are comprised of distinct 'objects' that form the shapes. The key is to separate components and track those based on 8-connectivity.\n3.  **Connection Markers:** There are some special 'red pixels' represented as the number 2.  These pixels are used to \"glue\" the shapes. These red pixels from each separate component are the key to the solution.\n4.  **Transformation Rule:** The task seems to be about translating shapes only, not rotating, mirroring, or scaling. The goal is to rearrange these shapes.\n\n**Example Analysis (Step-by-Step Breakdown):**\n\n*   I've carefully examined the provided examples to understand how objects relate.\n*   I look at individual shapes and try to identify the red pixels, and how those pixels fit together.\n*   I'm looking for a way of connecting objects by translation only so that the red pixels overlap.\n*   I'm making a hypothesis where I think a red pixel from one component touches the red pixel on another component. The red pixels will overlap, forming the connection point.\n\n**Strategy Refinement:**\n\n1.  **Parse Input:** I will first identify connected objects or components in the input grid.\n2.  **Locate 'Ports':** For each object, I'll record the coordinates (relative) of the red pixels (value 2).\n3.  **Solve the Puzzle:** My core algorithm will be: find a shift that all objects such that red pixels from different objects overlap.  The constraints are that the red pixels all connect, but otherwise objects don't overlap, and that the end result is a single connected component.\n4.  **Construct Output:** I'll initialize an output grid. Then, for each input object, I'll translate (using the determined shift) and place the pixels of that object in the output grid.\n\n**Applying the Logic to Test Input:**\n\n*   I'm currently working with a fresh test input grid, systematically identifying all shapes and cataloging the positions of all the red pixels.\n*   My goal is to find those shifts which satisfy all connection constraints.\n*   I'm noting that the final assembly *must* preserve the shape's original form and the holes (the 0 pixels inside each shape).\n*   A major insight is that any red pixel that doesn't find a partner in the output is also allowable.\n*   It's like a painter's model. Each color is an object. They are shifted but never overlapping, unless the colors are \"2.\"\n\n**Output Construction:**\n\n*   I now need to construct the 26x26 output grid, applying the determined shifts to the input objects.\n*   I can create output by iterating over each grid cell and placing each shape.\n*   The overall structure seems predictable (Yellow is likely to be central, with others surrounding).\n*   The final check is to ensure that the shapes fit together correctly without overlap, except at red pixels.\n\nAfter reviewing the coordinate conversions, I will be ready to generate the output grid!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to reassemble a set of scattered shapes into a single connected assembly. The \"red pixels\" (value 2) act as connectors or alignment points. Based on the solved examples, the logic is:\n\n1.  **Identify Components**: Parse the input grid to identify distinct disconnected shapes (objects). The red pixels attached to a shape are part of that shape's \"interface\".\n2.  **Match Connectors**: Find a translation for each shape such that their red pixels overlap with the red pixels of adjacent shapes. The overlap of two red pixels (2 on 2) confirms a valid connection.\n3.  **Construct Assembly**: Translating all pieces according to the matched connections forms a single compact object.\n\n**Analysis of Test Input Components & Shifts:**\n\n*   **Grey Object (Color 5)**: Located at top-right (rows 12-16, cols 18-23).\n    *   Has bottom connectors at relative positions that match the Green object's top connectors.\n    *   **Shift**: Move **Up 11, Left 7**.\n*   **Green Object (Color 3)**: Located at bottom-right (rows 21-25, cols 10-17).\n    *   Has top connectors matching Grey and left connectors matching Teal.\n    *   **Shift**: Move **Up 16** (Left/Right 0).\n*   **Teal Object (Color 8)**: Located at top-left (rows 1-7, cols 3-7).\n    *   Has right connectors matching Green's left connectors and a bottom-right connector matching Yellow's left connector.\n    *   **Shift**: Move **Down 4, Right 3**.\n*   **Yellow Object (Color 4)**: Located at center-left (rows 10-13, cols 9-13).\n    *   Acts as a central hub. Matches Teal (Top-Left side) and Blue (Right side).\n    *   **Shift**: **No Shift** (0, 0).\n*   **Blue Object (Color 1)**: Located at bottom-left (rows 20-25, cols 2-6).\n    *   Has left connectors matching Yellow's right connector and bottom connectors matching Pink's top connectors.\n    *   **Shift**: Move **Up 9, Right 11**.\n*   **Pink Object (Color 6)**: Located at top-right (rows 4-7, cols 18-22).\n    *   Has top connectors matching Blue's bottom connectors.\n    *   **Shift**: Move **Down 12, Left 5**.\n\n**Resulting Structure:**\n*   **Grey** sits on top of **Green**.\n*   **Teal** sits to the left of **Green** and above **Yellow**.\n*   **Yellow** sits to the left of **Blue**.\n*   **Blue** sits on top of **Pink**.\n\nAll \"internal\" red pixels overlap perfectly. Some \"terminal\" red pixels (on the outer boundary) remain visible, consistent with the examples.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\nApplying the calculated shifts to every non-zero pixel in the input grid:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs preserve every input component\u2019s shape and colors; changes are consistent with **translation-only rearrangement**.\n* Disconnected pieces in the input become **one connected, compact assembly** in the output.\n* **Red pixels** appear to mark key extremities and often land on **junctions** between pieces, suggesting they guide alignment.\n* Outline pieces keep their **black holes/cavities**; the task does not fill interiors.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Summary - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC puzzle. The goal is to rearrange a bunch of colored shapes, basically a translation-only jigsaw. The key is these red pixels \u2013 they're the connectors, the \"glue\" that lets us stick the pieces together. No rotations, no scaling, just slide 'em around until everything clicks.\n\nI started by breaking down the input, figuring out what these components are and where their red \"ports\" are. I need to treat each connected blob of non-black pixels as a single component, even if a few red pixels are attached to the side. The hint emphasizes that the red pixels, or junctions, guide the assembly.\n\nAnalyzing Example 1 gave me a good feel for how things work. It's all about making sure the red pixels overlap in the final arrangement. Pieces don't just touch randomly; they connect at those red dots, or they touch by sharing a red connection. I'm thinking of it like a set of matching puzzle pieces. You have a bunch of pieces, each with little notches (red pixels). These notches must align and overlap when you put the pieces together.\n\nWith this in mind, I developed a plan: first, identify all the individual components, then map out their red \"connectors.\" After that comes the tricky part \u2013 finding the right arrangement so all pieces are connected and red pixels are properly aligned. It's essentially a graph problem, where the components are nodes, and the red pixels are edges.\n\nFor the Test Input, I meticulously extracted the shapes and precisely listed out their red ports. I need to create a list with components, their positions, and each component's relevant red pixel coordinates.\nI then carefully examined the Test Input components, calculating their sizes and red pixel locations. I'm focusing on finding pairs of red pixels that could potentially fit together. If two pieces have a red connector on the bottom and top, they should fit. I have to make sure to do the correct relative translations of the objects.\n\nThe most challenging step is to test different translation-based placements for the components, looking for red-pixel overlaps to establish connections. Since there's no rotation or scaling, it's about trying different horizontal and vertical shifts to line things up.\nIf connections seem impossible, I will need to verify each object's extracted data to minimize data transcription error.\n\nAfter I've carefully organized the pieces using the red junctions, the code should reconstruct the grid.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we identify the distinct components in the input grid and their \"ports\"\u2014the red pixels (value 2)\u2014which serve as connection points. The goal is to assemble these components into a single connected structure by overlapping matching red pixels, using translation only.\n\n**Component Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Teal (8) Structure**: An H-like shape or ladder.\n    *   Ports: Top-Left, Top-Right, Mid-Right, Bottom-Right, Bottom-Left.\n2.  **Pink (6) Structure**: An inverted U-shape.\n    *   Ports: Top-Left, Top-Right.\n3.  **Yellow (4) Block**: A 3x3 block with protruding connectors.\n    *   Ports: Top, Left, Right, Bottom.\n4.  **Green Stick (3)**: A vertical line of 3s with a 2 at the bottom.\n    *   Port: Bottom.\n5.  **Grey (5) Frame**: A square frame open at the bottom.\n    *   Ports: Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right.\n6.  **Blue (1) U-Shape**: A U-shape or box open at the top.\n    *   Ports: Top-Left, Top-Inner-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right.\n7.  **Green Big (3) E-Shape**: A large structure with horizontal bars.\n    *   Ports: Left-Upper-Tip, Left-Lower-Tip, Top-Left, Top-Right.\n\n**Assembly Logic:**\n\nWe connect the pieces based on the spatial configuration of their red pixels:\n\n*   **Green Stick (4) on Teal (1)**: The bottom of the stick connects to the Top-Left of the Teal shape.\n*   **Teal (1) on Blue (6)**: The Bottom-Left of the Teal shape connects to the Top-Left of the Blue shape.\n*   **Teal (1) on Yellow (3)**: The Bottom-Right of the Teal shape connects to the Top of the Yellow shape.\n    *   Note: The Blue, Teal, and Yellow pieces all converge such that the Teal Bottom-Left, Yellow Left, and Blue Top-Left red pixels overlap at the same coordinate.\n*   **Blue (6) on Pink (2)**: The Bottom ports of the Blue shape connect to the Top ports of the Pink shape.\n*   **Teal (1) on Green Big (7)**: The Right-side ports of the Teal shape (Top-Right and Mid-Right) connect to the Left-side tips of the Green Big shape.\n*   **Grey (5) on Green Big (7)**: The Bottom ports of the Grey frame connect to the Top ports of the Green Big shape.\n\n**Construction Coordinates:**\n\nWe determine a final position for the assembly centered in the 26x26 grid. Let's place the **Blue (6) Top-Left pixel** at grid coordinate **(14, 7)** (Row 14, Col 7).\n\n*   **C6 (Blue)** Top-Left at (14, 7).\n*   **C1 (Teal)** Bottom-Left at (14, 7). This places its Top-Left at (8, 7).\n*   **C3 (Yellow)** Left at (14, 7). This places its Top at (13, 10).\n*   **C4 (Green Stick)** Bottom at (8, 7). Top at (5, 7).\n*   **C2 (Pink)** Top-Left at (18, 7).\n*   **C7 (Green Big)** Upper Left Tip connects to Teal Top-Right at (9, 11).\n*   **C5 (Grey)** Bottom-Left connects to Green Big Top-Left at (8, 13).\n\n**Pixel plotting:**\nAll components are drawn at these relative offsets. Red pixels at junctions overlap.

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs preserve every input component\u2019s shape and colors; changes are consistent with **translation-only rearrangement**.\n* Disconnected pieces in the input become **one connected, compact assembly** in the output.\n* **Red pixels** appear to mark key extremities and often land on **junctions** between pieces, suggesting they guide alignment.\n* Outline pieces keep their **black holes/cavities**; the task does not fill interiors.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs preserve every input component\u2019s shape and colors; changes are consistent with **translation-only rearrangement**.\n* Disconnected pieces

alignment.\n* Outline pieces keep their **black holes/cavities**; the task does not fill interiors.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n1. **Identify pieces (connected components)**  \n   Treat every 4-connected non\u2011zero component as a rigid \u201cpiece\u201d. Pieces may be multicolored: the **red (2)** pixels that touch a shape belong to that same piece.\n\n2. **Red pixels are \u201cconnectors\u201d that must overlap**  \n   In the outputs, the total number of red pixels is **halved**: this happens because red pixels from *two different pieces* are translated to the **same cell** (overlap).  \n   Non-red pixels do **not** overlap.\n\n3. **One piece stays fixed (the 3\u00d73 yellow block)**  \n   In both examples, the solid **yellow (4) 3\u00d73 block** (with its attached reds) remains in the same absolute position. All other pieces translate to connect to it (directly or indirectly).\n\n4. **How to find translations**\n   - Each overlap constraint is:  \n     `redA + TA = redB + TB`  \n     so relative translations are determined by matching red patterns.\n   - When two reds are used between the same two pieces, their relative spacing must match (gives a unique translation).\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n**Anchor (fixed):** the 3\u00d73 block of 4s at rows 11\u201313, cols 11\u201313, with reds at  \n(10,13), (11,10), (13,14), (14,12).\n\nThen we match red patterns to pair *all* 22 red pixels into 11 overlaps:\n\n- The **blue (1) piece** has two reds with offset **(1,\u22122)**, matching the anchor\u2019s reds (13,14) and (14,12). This fixes its translation, and consequently fixes where its remaining two reds land; those match the **magenta (6) piece** red pair.\n- The **cyan (8) piece** has two reds with offset **(1,\u22123)**, matching the anchor\u2019s remaining reds (10,13) and (11,10). This fixes its translation; its remaining vertical red pair then matches the **green (3) \u201cbig\u201d piece** vertical red pair.\n- The big green (3) piece\u2019s remaining top red pair matches the **gray (5) piece** red pair.\n- The last remaining red on the cyan (8) piece matches the single red of the **small green (3) vertical line** piece.\n\nAll pieces become one connected assembly; only red pixels overlap.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid (26\u00d726)\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs preserve every input component\u2019s shape and colors; changes are consistent with **translation-only rearrangement**.\n* Disconnected pieces in the input become **one connected, compact assembly** in the output.\n* **Red pixels** appear to mark key extremities and often land on **junctions** between pieces, suggesting they guide alignment.\n* Outline pieces keep their **black holes/cavities**; the task does not fill interiors.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Split the input into connected components** (4-neighborhood), treating every non\u2011zero cell (including the red `2` cells) as part of its component.\n2. One component contains a **solid 3\u00d73 block of color `4` plus some red `2` markers**. In both training examples this \u201c4-block component\u201d is **not moved**.  \n   \u2192 Use it as the **fixed anchor**.\n3. Every other component is **translated only** (no rotation, no recoloring) and placed so that **red `2` cells coincide** with red `2` cells of already placed parts.  \n   *When two pieces share a red marker location, that cell stays red (`2`).*  \n4. The correct placement is determined by matching **constellations of red markers**:\n   - The `8` component has two red markers with the same relative offset as the anchor\u2019s **top and left** markers, so it is translated to overlap **both**.\n   - The large `3` component has two left red markers matching the `8` component\u2019s two right red markers, so it overlaps **both**.\n   - The `5` component has two bottom red markers matching the large `3` component\u2019s two top red markers, so it overlaps **both**.\n   - The `1` component has two red markers matching the anchor\u2019s **bottom and right** markers, so it overlaps **both**.\n   - The `6` component\u2019s two top red markers match the `1` component\u2019s two bottom red markers, so it overlaps **both**.\n   - The small vertical `3` pillar has one bottom red marker; it is attached by overlapping it with the remaining top red marker of the `8` component.\n\nThe output is the union of all these translated components, with the `4`-block staying fixed.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid (26\u00d726)\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs preserve every input component\u2019s shape and colors; changes are consistent with **translation-only rearrangement**.\n* Disconnected pieces

alignment.\n* Outline pieces keep their **black holes/cavities**; the task does not fill interiors.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n- Treat every **4\u2011connected nonzero component** as a rigid \u201cpiece\u201d.  \n  Pieces keep **all colors and internal holes**; **no rotations or reflections** occur\u2014**translation only**.\n- **Red (2) pixels are connectors**. The rearrangement is done by sliding pieces so that **red connector pixels from different pieces land on the same cells** (they overlap), creating junctions that make the whole result **one connected, compact assembly**.\n- One piece acts as a fixed anchor: the **solid 3\u00d73 block of color 4** (with its attached red connectors) stays **exactly where it is**; all other pieces translate to connect to it and each other.\n- Which pieces connect is determined by matching **red-connector patterns**: if two red pixels on one piece have the same offset as two red pixels on another piece, those pairs can be overlapped simultaneously, uniquely determining a translation.\n\n### Applying this to the test input\n\n1. **Anchor** is the 3\u00d73 block of **4** (it stays fixed).\n2. The **5-frame** has two red connectors **3 columns apart** \u2192 it must attach to the **large 3-piece** whose two **top** red connectors are also **3 columns apart**.\n3. The **6 U-shape** has two red connectors **4 columns apart** \u2192 it must attach to the **1 outline** whose two **bottom** red connectors are **4 columns apart**.\n4. The small **3 vertical line** has a single red connector; the only piece with an odd number of red connectors is the **8-piece**, so that single connector attaches to the **top red** of the 8-piece.\n5. The 8-piece\u2019s **two right-side red connectors** are **2 rows apart**, matching the **two left red connectors** on the large 3-piece (also 2 rows apart), so they overlap.\n6. The 8-piece\u2019s remaining two red connectors match the anchor\u2019s **(left, top)** red offset, so the 8-piece is fixed to the **left+top** connectors of the 4-block.\n7. Finally, the 1-outline\u2019s remaining two red connectors match the anchor\u2019s **(right, bottom)** red offset, so the 1-outline overlaps the 4-block\u2019s **right+bottom** connectors.\n\nPlacing all translated pieces and taking the union gives the output below.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid (26\u00d726)\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\n### Pair 1 (Input 1 \u2192 Output 1)\n- **Background**: black.\n- **Input 1** contains **5 disconnected colored components**, each mostly one main color and containing a few **small red pixels** attached to the component:\n  1. A **blue** hollow, square/loop-like outline (has an interior black hole) with several **red** pixels attached along its perimeter.\n  2. A **light-blue** \u201cbar with two downward legs\u201d (\u03a0-like) shape with **red** pixels at some of its extremities.\n  3. A **solid yellow square/block** with **red** pixels positioned adjacent to it (at its sides/corners).\n  4. A **gray** partial rectangular outline (bracket/C-like) with **red** pixels near its open ends.\n  5. A **green** arch/inverted-U (\u2229-like) shape with **red** pixels at its lower ends.\n- **Output 1** shows the **same 5 components** with the **same colors and internal pixel patterns**, but **translated** and **packed together** so that they form **one compact cluster** (components touch/are adjacent). No new colors appear; the black background fills the old locations.\n\n### Pair 2 (Input 2 \u2192 Output 2)\n- **Background**: black.\n- **Input 2** contains **5 disconnected components**:\n  1. A **blue** partial outline (C/\u0393-like) with **red** pixels at some endpoints/corners.\n  2. A **solid yellow square/block** with **red** pixels adjacent to it.\n  3. A **green** partial outline (similar \u201cbracket/C-like\u201d family) with **red** pixels at endpoints/corners.\n  4. A **magenta** inverted-U/arch (\u2229-like) with **red** pixels at its lower ends.\n  5. A **light-blue** U-like shape (open upward) with **red** pixels at its upper ends.\n- **Output 2** again shows the **same set of components** with **unchanged shapes/colors**, but **moved** into a **single tight, connected assembly** near the center, enclosing **internal black cavities/holes** formed by the outline-like pieces.\n\n**What changes overall**: absolute positions of components (they are rearranged and brought together).  \n**What stays the same overall**: component shapes, their colors (including red pixels), and the black background color.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement**: **present**\n- **Object recoloring**: **absent**\n- **Bordering / outlining**: **absent**\n- **Filling holes or cavities**: **absent**\n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape**: **absent**\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning**: **present** (repositioning without duplication)\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**: **maybe** (final cluster appears centered/compact)\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**: **maybe** (red appears as a special accent on all pieces)\n- **Size-based filtering or selection**: **absent**\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations**: **absent**\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**: **absent**\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**: **absent**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **Rigid-body preservation**: Each multi-color component (main color + red pixels) appears preserved exactly; the change is consistent with **translation only** (no rotation/mirroring, no re-drawing).\n2. **All pieces are used**: Nothing is discarded; the output is essentially a **re-arrangement** of all non-background components into one structure.\n3. **Red pixels behave like \u201cendpoints/joints\u201d**: In the packed outputs, red pixels frequently sit at **interfaces where pieces meet**, suggesting the red positions constrain how pieces can be placed relative to each other.\n4. **Canonical assembly independent of initial scatter**: Inputs have pieces scattered differently, yet outputs always form a **single compact connected cluster**, implying initial absolute coordinates are mostly irrelevant.\n5. **Holes are structural, not targets**: Hollow interiors in outline-like shapes remain black; the process doesn\u2019t fill cavities\u2014packing can even create/maintain visible interior holes in the final assembly.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nThe task likely treats each disconnected colored component as a **puzzle piece** and **translates** them (without rotation) into a **single connected assembled figure**. The small **red pixels** act as **connection markers** that determine how pieces should align/touch, producing a compact, centered composite while preserving every piece\u2019s internal pattern and any holes.\n\n(Alternative close family if connector-matching is wrong: \u201cpack all components into a canonical tight arrangement (minimal bounding box / centered), preserving shapes exactly.\u201d)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks to perform when solving\n\n1. **Component matching check**: Normalize each input component by its bounding box and confirm the output contains the same set of shapes via translation only.\n2. **Red-joint verification**: Measure whether contacts between different pieces in the output occur specifically at/near **red pixels** (overlap or edge-adjacency).\n3. **Anchor identification**: Test whether a particular piece (often the solid yellow block) is placed at a consistent role (e.g., central hub) in the assembled cluster.\n4. **Compactness criterion**: Compare the output cluster\u2019s bounding box area to see if it is near-minimal given the pieces (i.e., evidence of \u201ctight packing\u201d).\n5. **No-rotation confirmation**: For each piece, verify orientation is unchanged (e.g., U-shapes still open the same direction).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* Outputs preserve every input component\u2019s shape and colors; changes are consistent with **translation-only rearrangement**.\n* Disconnected pieces in the input become **one connected, compact assembly** in the output.\n* **Red pixels** appear to mark key extremities and often land on **junctions** between pieces, suggesting they guide alignment.\n* Outline pieces keep their **black holes/cavities**; the task does not fill interiors.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Hollow Frames: Open rectangular shapes (arches/brackets) of variable primary colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 8) with endpoints marked by color 2.\n2. Solid Squares: 3x3 blocks of color 4, surrounded by four corner markers of color 2 located diagonally outward.\n3. Background: Uniform field of color 0.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nIdentify the `4` (3x3) square + its `2` markers as a fixed anchor. Translate each hollow frame (colors `1/3/5/6/8` with `2` markers) without rotation/reflection/recoloring, and reassemble them near the `4` square by aligning/overlapping their `2` marker cells with `2` markers on the square and/or other frames. Allow overlaps only on color `2`. Erase frames from their original locations to `0`, leaving only the assembled structure on a `0` background.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Strategy Formation:**\n\nOkay, the user wants me to solve an ARC task, likely some kind of pattern recognition or geometric transformation problem. Two examples are provided, plus a test input. My expert intuition tells me this involves understanding shapes, their relative positions, and the rules of how they are assembled. The \"structured description of objects and the transformation rule\" is key. I'm thinking I'll need to do the following:\n\n*   **Understand the building blocks:** Identify the core shapes and their attributes (colors, sizes, and any special markers/connectors).\n*   **Decipher the assembly rule:** This is probably the trickiest part. I'll need to look at the examples and description to determine how the shapes are put together, what drives the placement (overlapping markers? Fixed positions? Something else?).\n*   **Apply to the test case:** Once I have the rules, I can break down the test input, identify the component shapes, and reassemble them according to the rules to get the answer.\n\n**Shape Deconstruction and Feature Extraction:**\n\nSo, let's dive into the examples and the description. There's a 3x3 square of color 4. It has corner markers of color 2, located diagonally outward. This seems to be the central \"anchor\" shape that everything else is built around. I need to note where these markers are relative to the square. And also if they use coordinates or an offset. The text suggests that the markers play a crucial role in alignment or overlap.\n\nNext, there are \"hollow frames\". I need to find these. These are the shapes that are made of a color, but with \"endpoints marked by color 2\". Let's trace their boundaries and determine how to use the markers for each. Are these just the end points? Or a key to translation and rotation?\n\nThe \"test input\" is critical. I'll need to carefully map out the positions of everything in this grid: The anchor, frames, and the \"markers\" (color 2s). These markers are likely the key.\n\n**Analysis of Specific Shapes in Test Input:**\n\n1.  **3x3 square (Color 4):** Located at rows 10-12, columns 10-12. The description says \"surrounded by four corner markers of color 2 located diagonally outward\", So marker locations are: Left-Top at (10,9), Right-Top (9,12), Right-Bottom (12,13), and Bottom-Middle (13,11).\n\n2.  **Shape A (Color 8):** The structure is a Top-Left area. A rectangle. The markers seem to define their bounds, and there are more markers within it. Markers are located at (0,3), (1,7), (3,7), (5,6) and (6,3).\n\n3.  **Shape B (Color 6):** Located at Top-Right, a \"U\". Markers are at the top-left (3, 18) and top-right (3, 22) tips of the opening. It is a basket or cup.\n\n4.  **Shape C (Color 3, Distinct)**: The middle left area (Cols 4), located at Rows 11-13 (indices 10-12). No obvious Markers. Located at (14,4).\n\n5.  **Shape D (Color 5):** Located at Middle Right. Inverted U. Markers at (15,19) and (15,22). A shape with bottom markers at col 19,22.\n\n6.  **Shape E (Color 1):** Located at Bottom Left. Looks like a loop or incomplete rectangle. Markers around this rectangle. Location: Markers at (19,4), (20,2), (24,2), (24,6).\n\n7.  **Shape F (Color 3, Distinct):** Bottom Right. Shaped like an `[`, with Markers at (21,10), (20,12), and (20,15), (23,10).\n\n**Strategic Plan**\n\nMy Strategy:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core:** The 3x3 square of 4s is the core, or \"anchor\" around which everything revolves. Find its \"ports\" (the surrounding 2s).\n\n2.  **Define Shapes:** Scan the input to extract each object. Note its color, shape boundaries, and location of any \"2\" markers relative to its bounding box. I need to pay extra attention to shapes that might connect to each other.\n\n3.  **Find Connections:** Matching the geometry of markers on the shapes to the markers surrounding the 4-square\n\nThe problem asks us to reassemble scattered \"hollow frames\" around a central anchor. The anchor is a 3x3 square of color `4`, surrounded by markers of color `2`. Each frame is a shape of a specific color (`1`, `3`, `5`, `6`, `8`) with its own `2` markers. The transformation rule requires translating each frame so that its markers overlap with compatible markers on the anchor or on already-attached frames. Overlaps are allowed only on the `2` markers.\n\n**1. Analyze the Anchor**\nThe anchor is a 3x3 square of `4`s located at rows 10-12 and columns 10-12.\nIts markers (ports) are located at:\n*   (10, 9): Left of the top-left corner.\n*   (9, 12): Above the top-right corner.\n*   (12, 13): Right of the bottom-right corner.\n*   (13, 11): Below the bottom-center.\n\n**2. Analyze and Connect the Frames**\nWe identify each frame, its markers, and find a translation that snaps it to an available port.\n\n*   **Color 8 Frame (Top-Left):**\n    *   Found in the top-left of the input. Contains markers at (0,3), (1,7), (3,7), (5,6), (6,3).\n    *   The vector from marker (5,6) to (6,3) is `(+1, -3)`.\n    *   The vector from anchor port (9,12) to (10,9) is `(+1, -3)`.\n    *   **Action:** Translate Color 8 frame by `(+4, +6)`.\n    *   Markers (5,6) and (6,3) overlap anchor ports (9,12) and (10,9).\n    *   This adds new ports from the frame, including (0,3) which moves to **(4,9)** and (1,7) which moves to **(5,13)**.\n\n*   **Color 1 Frame (Bottom-Left):**\n    *   Found in the bottom-left. Markers include (20,2), (19,4).\n    *   The vector from (20,2) to (19,4) is `(-1, +2)`.\n    *   The vector from anchor port (13,11) to (12,13) is `(-1, +2)`.\n    *   **Action:** Translate Color 1 frame by `(-7, +9)`.\n    *   Markers (20,2) and (19,4) overlap anchor ports (13,11) and (12,13).\n    *   This adds new ports, including (24,2) which moves to **(17,11)** and (24,6) which moves to **(17,15)**.\n\n*   **Color 3 Frame (Right-Side Bracket):**\n    *   Found in the bottom-right area (Part 6 in thought process). Markers at (21,10) and (23,10) on its left vertical edge.\n    *   Vector between them is `(+2, 0)`.\n    *   The Color 8 frame (now attached) has unused markers at (5,13) and (7,13). Vector is `(+2, 0)`.\n    *   **Action:** Translate Color 3 frame by `(-16, +3)`.\n    *   Markers (21,10) and (23,10) snap to (5,13) and (7,13).\n    *   This adds new ports on its top edge, originally (20,12) and (20,15), which move to **(4,15)** and **(4,18)**.\n\n*   **Color 5 Frame (Top-Right Inverted U):**\n    *   Found in the middle-right.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Hollow Frames: Open rectangular shapes (arches/brackets) of variable primary colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 8) with endpoints marked by color 2.\n2. Solid Squares: 3x3 blocks of color 4, surrounded by four corner markers of color 2 located diagonally outward.\n3. Background: Uniform field of color 0.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nIdentify the `4` (3x3) square + its `2` markers as a fixed anchor. Translate each hollow frame (colors `1/3/5/6/8` with `2` markers) without rotation/reflection/recoloring, and reassemble them near the `4` square by aligning/overlapping their `2` marker cells with `2` markers on the square and/or other frames. Allow overlaps only on color `2`. Erase frames from their original locations to `0`, leaving only the assembled structure on a `0` background.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Verification**\n\nOkay, here's the situation. The user, who I assume is an expert, wants me to solve an ARC task that's essentially a puzzle with a set of rules. I need to take two examples and a test input and figure out how to transform the test input into the output. My initial task involves a thorough analysis of the object description provided by the user, verifying this description against the example inputs. I have to interpret \"hollow frames\" and \"solid squares,\" specifically, the role of the color 2 markers and the transformation rules. It's a matter of verifying, translating, and generating the correct output grid.\n\n**Analysis of \"Hollow Frames\"**\n\nSo, the user is talking about these rectangular shapes, or frames, which have a characteristic color 2 at the \"endpoints.\" I need to determine what this truly means by examining the example grids carefully. Are these markers at the corners or some interior point? I look at Example 1 and trace several shapes to decode the shape, trying to manually parse coordinates and spot the \"2\" markers, and how they correspond to the shape itself, that is, the shape's body (indicated by a number). I discover these markers are at the corners (or corners and endpoints), but there's an irregularity in the shape of the Teal frame that needs further exploration.\n\nI have to verify the \"2 markers\" description against these inputs, checking the coordinate positions and values to identify exactly what that means in this visual context. The important thing here is to recognize the transformation that involves reassembling these frames near the \"4\" square. The transformation says I must align / overlap the color 2 markers of these frames with the corresponding color 2 markers on the square, or other frames that might already be assembled.\n\n**Analysis of \"Solid Squares\"**\n\nNow, I look at the \"solid squares\" which are 3x3 blocks, always color 4, with color 2 corner markers diagonally outward. By examining Example 1 Input, I try to identify these markers relative to the 3x3, and discover that the markers are not truly at the *corners*. They are at the *edges*. This is important. These markers appear to act as a \"socket\" or \"hook,\" maybe where shapes are connected. It's not a direct connection on the diagonal corners but something irregular that depends on the positions of the 4s in the central structure and associated 2s. Now, it's not a straightforward \"corner\" marker as originally described. I must refine my understanding based on how these 2s relate to the 4s. I must carefully verify these details against Example 2 as well. These are the important structural components of the problem.\n\n**Transformation Hypothesis**\n\nBased on this, I hypothesize that: (1) there is a central structure (the 4-block) with \"2\"s. (2) There are detached shapes or frames with their own \"2\"s. (3) The goal is to move these shapes so that their \"2\"s align/overlap with the central structure's \"2\"s or existing shapes. It has to be a geometric connection. I need to understand if the geometry of how these \"2\"s are arranged on these frames matters when it comes to matching the central structure. It's all about geometric relationships.\n\n**Example 1: Connection Analysis**\n\nI'm now diving into Example 1 and tracing connections to verify my hypothesis. This is where I start seeing how it all works. I have to find a systematic way of identifying a shape, its origin, and its shift to its end position. I start with the \"Teal\" shape. Here, I'm trying to find the precise translation vector. It appears that the bottom \"2\" markers of the Teal shape are mapped to the top \"2\" markers of the \"4\" square. I compute a translation vector: (+6 rows, -7 cols) and check it again by verifying all the coordinates. This confirms the connection. I'm noting the bottom \"2\" corners of Teal must connect to top \"2\" corners of the square. I perform a series of calculations to get the translation that would map the starting point of Teal to the ending point. The 2s are very important. It's a sort of plug-and-play approach, with the \"2\" markers doing all the magic!\n\nI continue with the \"Blue\" shape. By examining the input and output, I work to establish the translation shift, it appears the key is to look at the '2's on the Blue shape, find what coordinate maps to (12,12), the right edge of the square, and make sure this transformation works for all the other shape points. After multiple checks and tracing, I compute a shift: (+7 rows, +10 cols). I make sure that the\n\nThe problem asks us to assemble a set of scattered \"hollow frame\" objects around a central \"anchor\" object. The transformation involves translating the frames so that their red markers (color `2`) overlap with the red markers of the anchor or other already-placed frames.\n\n**1. Object Analysis**\n\n*   **Anchor:** A 3x3 block of Yellow (`4`) squares located at `rows 10-12, cols 10-12` (note: the description says 3x3, and in the test input, the `4`s are in rows 10, 11, 12).\n    *   **Markers (Color `2`):**\n        *   Top-Left connection: `(10, 9)`\n        *   Top-Right connection: `(9, 12)`\n        *   Bottom-Right connection: `(12, 13)`\n        *   Bottom-Left connection: `(13, 11)`\n\n*   **Teal Frame (Color `8`):** Located at the top-left.\n    *   **Markers:** `(0, 3)`, `(1, 7)`, `(3, 7)`, `(5, 6)`, `(6, 3)`.\n    *   **Connection:** The markers at the bottom of this shape, `(6, 3)` and `(5, 6)`, match the geometry of the top markers of the Anchor, `(10, 9)` and `(9, 12)`.\n    *   **Transformation:** Shift `(6, 3)` to `(10, 9)` implies a translation of `rows +4, cols +6`.\n    *   **New Markers provided:** `(0, 3)` shifts to `(4, 9)`. `(1, 7)` shifts to `(5, 13)`. `(3, 7)` shifts to `(7, 13)`.\n\n*   **Blue Frame (Color `1`):** Located at the bottom-left/center (part of a cluster).\n    *   **Markers:** `(19, 4)`, `(20, 2)`, `(24, 2)`, `(24, 6)`.\n    *   **Connection:** The top markers `(19, 4)` and `(20, 2)` match the bottom markers of the Anchor `(12, 13)` and `(13, 11)`.\n    *   **Transformation:** Shift `(19, 4)` to `(12, 13)` implies a translation of `rows -7, cols +9`.\n    *   **New Markers provided:** `(24, 2)` shifts to `(17, 11)`. `(24, 6)` shifts to `(17, 15)`.\n\n*   **Green Frame (Color `3`):** Located at the bottom-left (right part of the cluster).\n    *   **Markers:** `(21, 10)`, `(23, 10)`, `(20, 12)`, `(20, 15)`.\n    *   **Connection:** The left markers `(21, 10)` and `(23, 10)` match the vertical markers on the right side of the shifted Teal frame: `(5, 13)` and `(7, 13)`.\n    *   **Transformation:** Shift `(21, 10)` to `(5, 13)` implies a translation of `rows -16, cols +3`.\n    *   **New Markers provided:** `(20, 12)` shifts to `(4, 15)`. `(20, 15)` shifts to `(4, 18)`.\n\n*   **Magenta Frame (Color `6`):** Located at the top-right.\n    *   **Markers:** `(3, 18)`, `(3, 22)`.\n    *   **Connection:** These top markers match the bottom markers of the shifted Blue frame: `(17, 11)` and `(17, 15)`.\n    *   **Transformation:** Shift `(3, 18)` to `(17, 11)` implies a translation of `rows +14, cols -7`.\n\n*   **Grey Frame (Color `5`):** Located at the middle-right.\n    *   **Markers:** `(15, 19)`, `(15, 22)`.\n    *   **Connection:** These top markers match the top markers of the shifted Green frame: `(4, 15)` and `(4, 18)`.\n    *   **Transformation:** Shift `(15, 19)` to `(4, 15)` implies a translation of `rows -11, cols -4`.\n\n**2. Assembly Construction**\n\nWe reconstruct the grid by applying these translations to the respective shapes. Overlaps occur on the connection markers (Color `2`), linking the structure into a single coherent unit.\n\n**3. Output Grid Description**\n\nThe final grid will contain the assembled structure on a background of 0.\n\n*   **Anchor (Yellow 4):** Center.\n*   **Teal (8):** Attached on Top.\n*   **Blue (1):** Attached on Bottom.\n*   **Green (3):** Attached to the Right of Teal.\n*   **Grey (5):** Attached to the Top of Green.\n*   **Magenta (6):** Attached to the Bottom of Blue.\n\n```csv\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Hollow Frames: Open rectangular shapes (arches/brackets) of variable primary colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 8) with endpoints marked by color 2.\n2. Solid Squares: 3x3 blocks of color 4, surrounded by four corner markers of color 2 located diagonally outward.\n3. Background: Uniform field of color 0.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nIdentify the `4` (3x3) square + its `2` markers as a fixed anchor. Translate each hollow frame (colors `1/3/5/6/8` with `2` markers) without rotation/reflection/recoloring, and reassemble them near the `4` square by aligning/overlapping their `2` marker cells with `2` markers on the square and/or other frames. Allow overlaps only on color `2`. Erase frames from their original locations to `0`, leaving only the assembled structure on a `0` background.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Hollow Frames: Open rectangular shapes (arches/brackets) of variable primary colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 8) with endpoints marked by color 2.\n2. Solid Squares: 3x3 blocks of color 4, surrounded by four corner markers of color 2 located diagonally outward.\n3. Background: Uniform field of color 0.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nIdentify the `4` (3x3) square + its `2` markers as a fixed anchor. Translate each hollow frame (colors `1/3/5/6/8` with `2` markers) without rotation/reflection/recoloring, and reassemble them near the `4` square by aligning/overlapping their `2` marker cells with `2` markers on the square and/or other frames. Allow overlaps only on color `2`. Erase frames from their original locations to `0`, leaving only the assembled structure on a `0` background.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### How the transformation works\n\n1. **Find the anchor**: the only **3\u00d73 block of `4`** (rows 11\u201313, cols 11\u201313 in the test). This block stays fixed. The `2` cells attached to it are its connection markers.\n\n2. **Treat every other colored object (colors 1/3/5/6/8) together with its attached `2`s as a \u201cframe piece.\u201d**  \n   These `2` cells are the *only* allowed overlap points.\n\n3. **Reassemble by translating pieces so that `2` markers coincide** (no rotation/reflection).  \n   In this test, the marker geometry forces a unique chain of connections:\n   - The **8-piece** has a pair of markers with the same offset as the **square\u2019s two upper/left markers**, so translate it to overlap those.\n     - Translation: **(+4, +6)**\n   - The **1-piece** has a marker pair matching the **square\u2019s right/bottom markers**, so translate it to overlap those.\n     - Translation: **(\u22127, +9)**\n   - The **6-piece** has two markers 4 columns apart; these match the remaining free marker pair on the moved **1-piece**, so translate it onto them.\n     - Translation: **(+14, \u22127)**\n   - The large **3-piece** has two markers 2 rows apart on its left side; these match the remaining vertical marker pair on the moved **8-piece**, so translate it onto them.\n     - Translation: **(\u221216, +3)**\n   - The **5-piece** has two markers 3 columns apart; these match the top marker pair on the moved large **3-piece**, so translate it onto them.\n     - Translation: **(\u221211, \u22124)**\n   - The small **3-piece** has one marker; translate it to overlap the last unused marker on the moved **8-piece**.\n     - Translation: **(\u221210, +5)**\n\n4. **Erase all original pieces** (set their old locations to `0`), leaving only the assembled structure.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid (27\u00d726)\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Hollow Frames: Open rectangular shapes (arches/brackets) of variable primary colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 8) with endpoints marked by color 2.\n2. Solid Squares: 3x3 blocks of color 4, surrounded by four corner markers of color 2 located diagonally outward.\n3. Background: Uniform field of color 0.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nIdentify the `4` (3x3) square + its `2` markers as a fixed anchor. Translate each hollow frame (colors `1/3/5/6/8` with `2` markers) without rotation/reflection/recoloring, and reassemble them near the `4` square by aligning/overlapping their `2` marker cells with `2` markers on the square and/or other frames. Allow overlaps only on color `2`. Erase frames from their original locations to `0`, leaving only the assembled structure on a `0` background.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### How the transformation works\n\n1. **Find the fixed anchor**: the only **3\u00d73 solid block of color `4`**. Keep it in place. It has several nearby **connector cells of color `2`** that are part of the anchor component.\n\n2. **Treat every other connected component made of a frame color (1/3/5/6/8) plus some `2`s as a movable piece.**  \n   Each such piece has one or more `2` \u201cconnector\u201d cells.\n\n3. **Reassemble by matching connector-pairs**:  \n   For each piece, look at the *relative vector* between two of its `2` cells (e.g. `(\u0394row, \u0394col)` between them).  \n   If another piece (or the anchor) has the **same connector-pair vector**, translate the piece so that the two `2` cells **overlap exactly**.  \n   (Overlaps are allowed only where the color is `2`.)\n\n4. **Apply the unique chain of matches in this test**:\n   - The **`8`-frame** has a `2`-pair with vector `(1,-3)` that matches the only such `2`-pair on the anchor \u21d2 translate `8` to overlap those.\n   - The **`1`-frame** has a `2`-pair with vector `(1,-2)` matching another anchor `2`-pair \u21d2 translate `1` to overlap those.\n   - The large **`3`-frame** has a `2`-pair with vector `(2,0)` matching an unused `2`-pair on the moved `8`-frame \u21d2 translate it to overlap.\n   - The **`5`-frame** has a `2`-pair with vector `(0,3)` matching the remaining top `2`-pair on the moved `3`-frame \u21d2 translate it to overlap.\n   - The **`6`-frame** has a `2`-pair with vector `(0,4)` matching the remaining `2`-pair on the moved `1`-frame \u21d2 translate it to overlap.\n   - The small **vertical `3` piece** has a single `2` connector; it attaches to the only remaining unpaired `2` on the moved `8`-frame.\n\n5. **Erase everything from the original locations**, leaving only the assembled structure on a `0` background.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n```csv\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Hollow Frames: Open rectangular shapes (arches/brackets) of variable primary colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 8) with endpoints marked by color 2.\n2. Solid Squares: 3x3 blocks of color 4, surrounded by four corner markers of color 2 located diagonally outward.\n3. Background: Uniform field of color 0.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nIdentify the `4` (3x3) square + its `2` markers as a fixed anchor. Translate each hollow frame (colors `1/3/5/6/8` with `2` markers) without rotation/reflection/recoloring, and reassemble them near the `4` square by aligning/overlapping their `2` marker cells with `2` markers on the square and/or other frames. Allow overlaps only on color `2`. Erase frames from their original locations to `0`, leaving only the assembled structure on a `0` background.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

                "response": "**Here's how I see the objects in these grids:**\n\nFirst, I notice two main object types. The first is a *multicolor rectangular frame*. These are essentially hollow rectangles, but they could be \"C\" shapes (open on one side), \"U\" shapes (open on the bottom), or even incomplete boxes.  The \"body\" of these frames is formed from one of the numbers: 1, 3, 5, 6, or 8. But here's the key thing: the endpoints or \"corners\" of these open shapes are always color 2.\n\nThe second object is a *solid square*. It's a 3x3 block, always the color 4.  And it's always \"accented\" with color 2 pixels. These accent pixels are located diagonally outward from each of the square's four corners.  Essentially, the square is 4x4 with the four corners removed.\n\nI see that the background or \"empty space\" in the grids is color 0.  I haven't been asked to describe any rules about positioning or relationships, just the objects themselves. That's a key observation. That's it, those are the objects I see.\n\n\nBased on the provided grids, the objects can be categorized into two distinct types based on their structure and color composition. The background is consistently color 0.\n\n**1. Hollow Rectangular Frames / Brackets**\n*   **Structure:** These objects appear as incomplete rectangular outlines. They form shapes resembling arches (inverted 'U'), buckets ('U'), or brackets ('C' facing left or right).\n*   **Primary Color:** The main body of these frames is composed of a single color, which varies between instances. Observed primary colors include 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   **Terminals:** The open ends or \"feet\" of these frames are consistently marked with color 2. For example, if the shape is an inverted 'U' of color 8, the bottom-most pixels of the two vertical columns are color 2.\n    *   **Orientation:** The orientation varies (opening up, down, left, or right), but the structural relationship between the primary color and the color 2 terminals remains constant.\n\n**2. Solid Squares**\n*   **Structure:** This object is a filled, solid square with dimensions of 3x3 pixels.\n*   **Primary Color:** The interior of the square is exclusively color 4.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   **Corner Markers:** Like the frames, these squares are associated with color 2. There are four pixels of color 2 located diagonally adjacent to the four corners of the 3x3 color 4 block. These markers do not touch the sides of the square but sit at the diagonal vertices.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Hollow Frames: Open rectangular shapes (arches/brackets) of variable primary colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 8) with endpoints marked by color 2.\n2. Solid Squares: 3x3 blocks of color 4, surrounded by four corner markers of color 2 located diagonally outward.\n3. Background: Uniform field of color 0.\n</objects_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Hollow Frames: Open rectangular shapes (arches/brackets) of variable primary colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 8) with endpoints marked by color 2.\n2. Solid Squares: 3x3 blocks of color 4, surrounded by four corner markers of color 2 located diagonally outward.\n3. Background: Uniform field of color 0.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nIdentify the `4` (3x3) square + its `2` markers as a fixed anchor. Translate each hollow frame (colors `1/3/5/6/8` with `2` markers) without rotation/reflection/recoloring, and reassemble them near the `4` square by aligning/overlapping their `2` marker cells with `2` markers on the square and/or other frames. Allow overlaps only on color `2`. Erase frames from their original locations to `0`, leaving only the assembled structure on a `0` background.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
