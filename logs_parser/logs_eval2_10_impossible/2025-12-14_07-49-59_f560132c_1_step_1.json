Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "Alright, so here's what I'm thinking about this ARC task. The user wants me to solve it based on a couple of examples. It looks like a pattern recognition problem, so I'm trying to figure out the underlying logic.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Hypotheses:**\n\nMy first thought is, \"Okay, let's break down these examples.\" I start by looking at Example 1. I notice that it's a 20x20 grid with several colored shapes. There's a red \"C\" shape, an orange block, a yellow shape, and a green block. The output is an 8x8 grid. I'm immediately noticing a downscaling operation happening here and the colors are different. I start connecting the dots: \"Input colors are somehow mapped to Output colors. Is there a simple color swap?\" Nope. Instead of focusing on simple transformations, I started to realize there's some kind of structure here.\n\nThe layout of the output gives me a clue: it seems to be quadrants corresponding to the shapes. The Input shapes seem to dictate the colors in output. I'm thinking, \"Is the output a downscaled version with a color mapping?\" No, there seems to be more. I looked closer. It looks like a scaled-up version of something inside the input shapes. I think I see a pattern: the colors inside the red frame are key. So, I realize that the holes inside the red frame are important. Those holes/noise have the values that are used as a mapping key.\n\nFor Example 2, I again analyze the Input and Output grids. This time, the key isn't in the top left, it's somewhere in the center. I see that the mapping is similar. I start noticing the Output colors correspond to colors inside the Key, and their position dictates how shapes are colored.\n\nThe key thing I am realizing is that it's all about **shapes and positions**. I need a way to combine shapes (from all the 4 quadrants) into the output grid.\n\n**Refining the Approach:**\n\nI start thinking \"Ah-ha! Key mapping!\". In both examples, there's a \"Key\" object (a shape with internal values) and other shapes in the different quadrants. I figure that those are the building blocks. I hypothesize, \"The key tells us how to recolor the other shapes!\"\n\nOkay, I need to figure out how the output is arranged. How are these different shapes combined to make the final output grid? I see the shapes are layered.\n\n**Focus on Dimensions & Layout:**\n\nI start to concentrate on grid dimensions. Both inputs are 20x20. But outputs are 8x8 and 10x10. I realized that the Output dimensions are related to the input shape extents. I'm imagining the input as a set of shapes, and the output is a rearrangement of those shapes. \"Do shapes overlap? Are they simply resized? What's the output size?\" I realized that my initial guess about dimensions wasn't correct. I came up with an idea: the \"Key\" object's dimensions dictate the Output. I realized that the Key's frame helps in setting the Output size.\n\n**The Solution Steps (Summarized):**\n\n1.  Identify the 4 main clusters of pixels.\n2.  Find the \"Key\" by identifying unique values inside a 2x2 hole or frame (2x2 of colors). Read those four colors (values).\n3.  Identify the location of the Key, and calculate each object's relationship to the Key's location.\n4.  Each value in the Key tells us which color to replace other clusters' pixels with.\n5.  Output Size depends on Input Extents (Key, and last color object).\n6.  Generate Output Grid.\n7.  Replace all values.\n8.  I will take the shapes from all 4 clusters and, with the key's help, put them together into a final output image.\n\nI'm thinking I've finally got it.  I can solve this! I am ready to move on to the code!\n\n\nTo solve this task, I will apply a transformation based on extracting shapes from the input grid and reassembling them into a new grid according to a specific \"Key\" found in the input.\n\n**Logic:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains four distinct clusters of colored pixels (shapes) against a black (0) background.\n2.  **Locate the Key:** One of these clusters is a \"Key Object\". It is distinguished by being a rectangular frame enclosing a 2x2 area of \"noise\" pixels. These 4 inner pixels are distinct colors and define the color mapping for the output.\n    *   The 2x2 inner region maps the four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) to specific colors:\n        *   `Key[0][0]` (Top-Left value) -> Target Color for the Top-Left Object.\n        *   `Key[0][1]` (Top-Right value) -> Target Color for the Top-Right Object.\n        *   `Key[1][0]` (Bottom-Left value) -> Target Color for the Bottom-Left Object.\n        *   `Key[1][1]` (Bottom-Right value) -> Target Color for the Bottom-Right Object.\n    *   In the Test Input, the Key Object is the Maroon (9) shape in the Top-Left quadrant. Its inner values are:\n        *   Top-Left: 3\n        *   Top-Right: 6\n        *   Bottom-Left: 4\n        *   Bottom-Right: 8\n3.  **Map Objects to Colors:**\n    *   **TL Object** (The Key itself): Maps to Color **3**.\n    *   **TR Object** (Grey 5 shape): Maps to Color **6**.\n    *   **BL Object** (Orange 7 shape): Maps to Color **4**.\n    *   **BR Object** (Red 2 shape): Maps to Color **8**.\n4.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**\n    *   The Output Grid width is the sum of the width of the Key Object's bounding box and the width of the Bottom-Right Object's bounding box.\n        *   Key Width = 10. BR Width = 6. Output Width = 16.\n    *   The Output Grid height is the sum of the height of the Key Object's bounding box and the height of the Bottom-Right Object's bounding box.\n        *   Key Height = 8. BR Height = 4. Output Height = 12.\n    *   Output Size: **16x12**.\n5.  **Construct the Output:**\n    *   **Background:** Fill the entire output grid with the color mapped to the Bottom-Right Object (Color **8**).\n    *   **Draw Bottom-Left Object:** Place the shape of the BL object (recolored to **4**) at the bottom-left of the layout structure, which corresponds to coordinates `(0, Key_Height)`. Crop any parts that fall outside the grid.\n    *   **Draw Top-Right Object:** Place the shape of the TR object (recolored to **6**) at the top-right of the layout structure, which corresponds to coordinates `(Key_Width, 0)`. Crop any parts that fall outside the grid.\n    *   **Draw Top-Left Object:** Place the shape of the TL object (recolored to **3**) at `(0, 0)`. The Key object is treated as a shape where non-zero pixels (frame + inner noise) are solid, and 0s are transparent (revealing the background).\n\n**Test Input Application:**\n\n*   **Output Size:** 16x12.\n*   **Fill:** Color 8.\n*   **Layer 1 (BL Object -> 4):** The Orange shape is placed at `(0, 8)`.\n    *   Row 0 maps to Output Row 8: `4,4,4`.\n    *   Row 1 maps to Output Row 9: `4,4,4`.\n    *   Row 2 maps to Output Row 10: `4,4,4`.\n    *   Row 3 maps to Output Row 11: `4`.\n*   **Layer 2 (TR Object -> 6):** The Grey shape is placed at `(10, 0)`.\n    *   Based on the shape analysis, it draws patterns of 6s on the right side (cols 10-15).\n*   **Layer 3 (TL Object -> 3):** The Maroon Key shape is placed at `(0, 0)`.\n    *   It draws the frame and inner pixels as 3s. Holes in the frame (0s) remain 8s.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,0,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,0,6,6,6,6,0\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,0,6,6,6,6,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,0,0,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,0,0,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,0,0,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,0,0,0,0\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,0,0,0,0\n\nWait, checking the TR object (Grey 5) alignment carefully:\nRow 6 (Input): `...5,5,5...` at indices 19-21.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Thoughts on ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here we go.  I'm presented with an ARC task. I need to figure out a pattern based on examples and apply it.  Let's break down the first example.  It's a grid with a bunch of shapes of different colors. The output is smaller, and it looks like a section of the input.  I'm noticing that the colors in the output don't seem to directly correspond to the colors of the main shapes in the input.  Hmm, this is interesting.\n\n**Uncovering the Core Pattern**\n\nI'm drawn to a \"red\" container-like shape in the input, and inside it are smaller colors. Bingo! These smaller, contained colors in the input, specifically their colors, seem to align with the output colors. This suggests the output is generated by focusing on the content *inside* certain input shapes.  The TL shape contains seeds. These seeds get mapped to the 4 quadrants of the output. I also realized that the other regions were not just placed as templates of the colors. \n\n**Mapping the Shapes**\n\nSo, the seed's position determines the destination output region. The shape's color inside that region must be used. Let's start thinking about what is causing each region's shape.  Analyzing the input grid's shapes themselves is key here. The output is also constructed to form some shape! They seem to be combined in a way that relates to the structure of the input, the shape and size.  I notice this might involve a clever rotation to fit within the 8x8 square.\n\n**Refining the Theory and Rotations**\n\nThe \"cycle\" mapping!  Not just which quadrant, but also *rotation*. Examining the Ex 2 case: it seems there's a specific order and some rotation going on.  The order is based on the input TL. What about Ex 2? The Ex 1 is a special case that doesn't follow a pattern, it seems. And Test Inputs will not be the same. The seed of the TL region and its arrangement drives where each element goes, and possibly by what angle or orientation the regions are placed.\n\n**Applying the Theory: Test Input**\n\nI need to apply this to the new test. I am thinking about how to visualize the shapes so they fit together.  Let's start by trying to place the largest shapes first. I'm focusing on the input arrangement to create the correct sized grid. I should check again the input sizes and then think about what the combined grids might look like. I should think about how to map them to an output and their shape.\n\n**Final Grid**\n\nThe logic appears to be to form a grid with parts of the original puzzle fitting. The frame appears to be the most important. The other elements are used to fill out the remaining parts. I have to make a best guess.\n\n\nThe ARC task presents a puzzle where the goal is to transform an input grid into an output grid based on a set of rules inferred from examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Input Segmentation**: The input grid contains four distinct colored clusters (shapes) located roughly in the four quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n    *   In the test input:\n        *   TL Cluster: Maroon (9)\n        *   TR Cluster: Grey (5)\n        *   BL Cluster: Orange (7)\n        *   BR Cluster: Red (2)\n\n2.  **Mapping Logic (Seed)**: Inside the Top-Left cluster (Maroon 9), there is a 2x2 block of \"intruder\" pixels that acts as a key for the output colors.\n    *   Test Input Seed (inside the 9s):\n        ```\n        3 6\n        4 8\n        ```\n    *   This 2x2 seed maps directly to the four quadrants of the output grid:\n        *   Output TL: Green (3)\n        *   Output TR: Magenta (6)\n        *   Output BL: Yellow (4)\n        *   Output BR: Light Blue (8)\n\n3.  **Shape Transformation & Assembly**: The output grid is formed by taking the shapes of the four input clusters and arranging them into a single rectangular block (puzzle fit). The shapes are transformed (moved and potentially rotated) to fit together.\n    *   **TL Input (9) $\\rightarrow$ Output TL (3)**: The TL shape is the \"anchor\" and is not rotated. It forms the left frame. Its shape (widths per row) is `9, 9, 4, 4, 2, 2, 7, 7`.\n    *   **Input BR (2) $\\rightarrow$ Output TR (6)**: Following the cycle pattern from Example 2 (BR $\\rightarrow$ TR), the BR shape (widths `3, 4, 5, 6`) is moved to the Top-Right. It fills the \"gap\" in the TL frame.\n        *   TL Gap at rows 2-5: Widths available are `5, 5, 7, 7`.\n        *   BR Shape `3, 4, 5, 6` fits perfectly into this gap.\n    *   **Input BL (7) $\\rightarrow$ Output BR (8)**: Following the pattern (BL $\\rightarrow$ BR), the BL shape (widths `3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1`) is moved to the Bottom-Right.\n        *   TL Gap at rows 6-7: Widths available are `2, 2`.\n        *   Wait, the TL shape at rows 6-7 has width 7, leaving a gap of 2 (assuming total width 9). The BL shape widths are `3,3...`. This doesn't fit directly.\n        *   However, looking at the assembled shapes in previous examples, the shapes are simply packed. The BL shape corresponds to the seed color 8 (BR position).\n    *   **Input TR (5) $\\rightarrow$ Output BL (4)**: The large shape corresponds to the remaining quadrant.\n\n    **Refined Assembly for Test Input**:\n    The output grid is constructed by taking the Anchor (TL shape, color 3) and filling its negative space with the other shapes.\n    *   **Frame (3)**:\n        Rows 0-1: Full width (9).\n        Rows 2-3: Width 4.\n        Rows 4-5: Width 2.\n        Rows 6-7: Width 7.\n    *   **Gap Filling**:\n        Rows 2-5 (Right side): The BR shape (converted to color 6) fits here.\n        Rows 6-7 (Right side): The remaining gap is small. The BL shape (converted to color 8) is placed here.\n        The layout of the output 8s and 4s is determined by the remaining fit. Given the seed `4 8` at the bottom, and the shapes available, the grid is constructed as a 9x8 block.\n\n**Output Grid Construction**:\n*   **Color 3 (Green)**: Follows the TL input mask.\n*   **Color 6 (Magenta)**: Fills the upper indentation (from Input BR).\n*   **Color 8 (Light Blue)**: Fills the lower indentation (from Input BL).\n*   **Color 4 (Yellow)**: Corresponds to the large input shape, but in the puzzle logic, it fills any remaining large background or is mapped to the specific corner indicated by the seed. In this specific compact puzzle assembly, the primary components are 3, 6, and 8 filling the 9x8 bounds.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,4,4\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4\n3,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,4\n3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**The Enigmatic ARC Task**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to solve an ARC task, and I'm looking at two example solutions to figure out the underlying logic. It seems we have two inputs, a 20x20 grid, and we need to output an 8x8 grid. The output is a smaller subset of the input data but still relies on it.\n\nLooking at Example 1, there are 4 distinct shapes, each in a different color.  One is especially interesting, it's this weird 'C' shaped thing with other colors inside, it's in the top left. The other three shapes are just blocks.  The output has colors and is a smaller grid. I need to figure out the connection.  It's the interior colors of that top-left shape: 1, 5, 8, 9, arranged as seeds that dictate the arrangement of the output.  The other shapes act as \"masks\" that dictate how the output is formed. They define the shape of regions, kind of.\n\nThe output looks like regions, partitioned using the colors from the red shape.\n\nLet's look closer, I see a pattern: the colors in the output grid are those that were found INSIDE the red shape.\n\nSo here's what I think: The key shape defines the colors and their relative arrangement. The other shapes define some geometry or \"mask\" the background color.\n\nThe output looks like a collision of regions. It seems like the output shapes have some relationship with the mask shapes.\n\nAfter looking at the first example, I'm thinking the colors are determined by the inner colors, but somehow the mask shapes are influencing the output shapes. I need to determine the influence.\n\nExample 2 reinforces the \"Legend\" and \"Mask\" concept. There's a legend shape again, this time magenta, and shapes of gray, maroon, and blue.\n\nThe goal seems to be to figure out the relationship between the colors in the legend, and the positions of the colors in the masks.\n\nNow I'm hypothesizing:  The output is essentially a scaled-up version of the legend's inner pixels, where the positions are influenced by the other shapes (like a Voronoi diagram but with more complex boundaries). The masks appear to influence the geometry of the final output. The boundaries between the output regions seem to be the intersections.\n\nMaybe it's about shape transformations.\n\nThe output size seems related to the bounding boxes of the shapes, it\u2019s all connected.\n\nI'm starting to think about this in terms of applying transformations to the shapes, where the Legend is used to map colors to their positions in the output. The input shapes are transformed and then superimposed to form the output grid.\n\nLet's test by confirming the first example. The Red Shape and its inner colors are acting as a map, telling me where to place things and what colors to use. I take the mask shapes, rotate them, and place them according to the legend's colors.  I think the rotations are the key to unlocking this puzzle.\n\nBased on the shape transformations, it seems that there are 4 main rules. They all relate to geometric transformations.\n\nI think I've cracked it.  It's about placing those shapes in a square grid and letting them collide. But what\u2019s that gap in the grid?  That must be determined by the shape. And if there is any unfilled area, it needs to be filled with something.\nI have a solid understanding of how it all works.\n\nThe solution involves identifying four distinct shapes in the input grid, determining a color mapping from a \"legend,\" transforming the shapes (rotation), and assembling them into a new, smaller grid.\n\n**1. Identify Shapes and Roles**\nThere are four quadrants of shapes in the input grid.\n*   **Top-Left (TL):** A \"Legend\" shape containing distinct inner colors. In the test input, this is the Maroon (9) shape. Inside it are pixels of colors 3, 6, 4, and 8.\n*   **Top-Right (TR):** A shape of a single color. In the test input, this is Cyan (5).\n*   **Bottom-Left (BL):** A shape of a single color. In the test input, this is Orange (7).\n*   **Bottom-Right (BR):** A shape of a single color. In the test input, this is Red (2).\n\n**2. Decode the Legend**\nThe Legend shape (Maroon 9) contains a 2x2 key of inner pixels:\n```\n3 6\n4 8\n```\nThis key maps the position of the input shapes to the colors they will become in the output:\n*   **TL Position** maps to **Color 3**.\n*   **TR Position** maps to **Color 6**.\n*   **BL Position** maps to **Color 4**.\n*   **BR Position** maps to **Color 8**.\n\nAdditionally, the color corresponding to the Bottom-Right shape (Color 8) serves as the **background color** for the output grid, filling any gaps.\n\n**3. Extract and Transform Shapes**\nWe extract the binary mask of each shape (bounding box) and apply specific geometric transformations:\n*   **TL Shape (Source 9 -> Target 3):** No rotation (Identity).\n    *   Input Bounding Box: 10 wide x 8 high.\n*   **TR Shape (Source 5 -> Target 6):** Rotate 90\u00b0 Clockwise.\n    *   Input Bounding Box: 10 wide x 12 high.\n    *   Rotated Size: 12 wide x 10 high.\n*   **BL Shape (Source 7 -> Target 4):** Rotate 90\u00b0 Counter-Clockwise.\n    *   Input Bounding Box: 3 wide x 6 high.\n    *   Rotated Size: 6 wide x 3 high.\n*   **BR Shape (Source 2 -> Target 8):** Rotate 180\u00b0. (This shape is the background color, so it merges with the fill).\n\n**4. Determine Output Grid Dimensions**\nThe output grid is a square. Its width is the sum of the widths of the top-row shapes:\n*   Width = Width(TL) + Width(Rotated TR) = 10 + 12 = **22**.\n*   Height = **22**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Output**\n*   Initialize a 22x22 grid with the background color **8**.\n*   **Place TL Shape (Color 3):** Anchored at (0, 0).\n    *   The shape has \"holes\" (from the 0s in the input loop), which remain as background (8).\n*   **Place TR Shape (Color 6):** Anchored at (0, 10). (Top-Right corner).\n    *   The shape is irregular, so background (8) remains where pixels are missing.\n*   **Place BL Shape (Color 4):** Anchored at (19, 0). (Bottom-Left corner).\n*   (BR Shape is conceptually placed at Bottom-Right, but since it is color 8, it is invisible against the background).\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Strategy: Shape Tiling with Color Mapping**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got to do: The user is challenging me with an ARC task, and my first step is to crack the code by examining a few examples and a test input. It looks like it's a grid puzzle where the input gets transformed into a smaller output. I see shapes and colors involved.\n\nMy thought process is starting with breaking down the shapes from the input grid. I see colorful regions and \"intruder\" pixels within some of them. In the first example, I see a red shape with other colors inside, and then this same arrangement is represented in the output in a smaller way. The intruders are the key. It looks like a mapping is happening. The sizes of the output seems related to the size of the shapes in the input.\n\nIt seems like there's a specific pattern with these \"intruders,\" their positions inside a primary shape (like the red shape in example 1), and their relation to the overall grid and output size. I start thinking this is an arrangement of the shapes. I realize there are shapes that represent the 4 quadrants of the output. The shape dictates the tile of the color in the output. The shapes are rotated, or resized to fit.\n\nAfter analyzing the examples, I can derive a hypothesis: I need to identify a \"Map\" (the shape containing the intruders). Then I check the layout of the other shapes in the input grid.  I need to figure out which position of these objects match the relative location of the intruder. The location of the object defines which color (aka intruder color) will go there.  The shapes are rotated by a certain degree.\n\nI am suspecting the grid is build with 4 shapes that are colored in according to the target colors, or intruder colors.\n\nI figured out a few things. Here's a summary of my transformation:\n\n1.  Find the \"Key Map\" (shape with intruder).\n2.  Find the object shapes that are used in the quadrant of the grid.  A color in the location matches the intruder locations.\n3.  Based on the mapping, I am looking for the tile that will be formed\n4.  Apply rotation (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees)\n5.  Tile the shapes.\n\nWith this knowledge, I can start applying this logic to the test case and build the required output, let's see how it goes.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects and Roles:**\n    *   The input grid contains four main distinct colored objects.\n    *   One of these objects (the **Map Object**) contains \"intruder\" pixels\u2014single pixels of colors different from the object itself.\n    *   The other three objects are solid shapes (or shapes with holes, but no intruders).\n\n2.  **Determine Mappings:**\n    *   The **Map Object** defines the target layout. The positions of the intruder pixels inside the Map Object correspond to the four quadrants of the output grid (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n    *   The **Intruder Colors** determine the color of the region in that quadrant of the output grid.\n    *   The **Source Shapes** for these output regions are the four objects in the input grid. The mapping from Input Object to Output Region is determined by their relative positions (Quadrants) in the input grid.\n    *   Analyzing Example 2 (which shares the mapping logic with the Test Input due to the swap pattern):\n        *   **TL Input Object** $\\rightarrow$ **TL Output Region** (Color defined by TL Intruder).\n        *   **BL Input Object** $\\rightarrow$ **TR Output Region** (Color defined by TR Intruder).\n        *   **TR Input Object** $\\rightarrow$ **BL Output Region** (Color defined by BL Intruder).\n        *   **BR Input Object** $\\rightarrow$ **BR Output Region** (Color defined by BR Intruder).\n\n3.  **Apply Transformations (Rotation and Tiling):**\n    *   The shapes are extracted, solidified (intruders/internal holes filled), and rotated to tile together into a square output grid.\n    *   **TL Source (Maroon)** $\\rightarrow$ **TL Target (Color 3)**: No rotation.\n    *   **BL Source (Orange)** $\\rightarrow$ **TR Target (Color 6)**: Rotated 90\u00b0 Clockwise.\n    *   **TR Source (Gray)** $\\rightarrow$ **BL Target (Color 4)**: Rotated to fit (likely 180\u00b0 or tailored to fill the gap).\n    *   **BR Source (Red)** $\\rightarrow$ **BR Target (Color 8)**: No rotation (or fits the remaining BR corner).\n    *   The dimensions of the output grid are the sum of the widths of the top-row shapes (TL width + TR width).\n        *   TL (Maroon) Width: 9.\n        *   TR (Orange, rotated) Width: 6.\n        *   Output Grid Size: 15x15.\n\n4.  **Construct the Output Grid:**\n    *   **Region 3 (Maroon Shape):** Placed at (0,0).\n        *   Rows 0-3: Width 9.\n        *   Rows 4-5: Width 2.\n        *   Rows 6-7: Width 7.\n    *   **Region 6 (Orange Shape):** Placed at Top-Right.\n        *   Rotated 90\u00b0 CW. Input was L-shape (3 wide, 6 high). Rotated is 6 wide, 3 high.\n        *   Fills the top-right corner gap. Row 0 matches full width (9+6=15). Rows 1-2 allow for an L-cutout.\n    *   **Region 8 (Red Shape):** Placed at Bottom-Right (relative to the shapes above).\n        *   Red shape is a triangle of widths 3, 4, 5, 6.\n        *   It fits under the Orange shape on the right side.\n    *   **Region 4 (Gray Shape):** Fills the remaining empty space (Bottom-Left and center gaps).\n\n**Generated Output Grid (15x15):**\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,8,8,8\n3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4",

In the test input, the 9s form the border with the pattern:\n   - Position (0,0): 3\n   - Position (0,1): 6  \n   - Position (1,0): 4\n   - Position (1,1): 8\n\n2. **Identify the three colored shapes** and count their cells:\n   - 5s shape: 62 cells (largest)\n   - 2s shape: 18 cells (middle)\n   - 7s shape: 12 cells (smallest)\n\n3. **Mapping based on cell count**:\n   - Smallest shape \u2192 template[1,0] = 4 (lower-left in output)\n   - Middle shape \u2192 template[0,1] = 6 (upper-right in output)\n   - Largest shape \u2192 template[1,1] = 8 (lower-right/diagonal in output)\n   - Remaining space \u2192 template[0,0] = 3 (upper-left in output)\n\n4. **Transform and combine shapes**: Each shape is rotated and placed in its designated quadrant. The shapes' boundaries create diagonal transitions where the largest shape fills the overlapping/central areas.\n\n5. **Output dimensions**: Based on the pattern, the output appears to be approximately 12\u00d712, combining the transformed shapes.\n\nConstructing the output with:\n- 6s (18 cells) in upper-right \n- 4s (12 cells) in lower-left\n- 8s (62 cells) filling lower-right and diagonal\n- 3s filling remaining upper-left space\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

Four colored shapes in the input that determine the output regions\n\n**Analyzing the examples:**\n- Example 1: The 2\u00d72 pattern `[1,5; 8,9]` is inside a border of 2s. Four shapes (2s, 7s, 4s, 3s) at different positions define output regions.\n- Example 2: The 2\u00d72 pattern `[2,4; 8,3]` is inside a border of 6s. Four shapes define the output regions.\n\nThe transformation appears to:\n1. Map each shape to a color from the 2\u00d72 pattern based on relative position\n2. Create an output where each quadrant is filled with the corresponding color\n3. Shapes determine diagonal boundaries between regions\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- The 2\u00d72 pattern at rows 5-6, cols 4-5 is: `[3,6; 4,8]`\n- Border shape: 9s (maps to color 3, top-left)\n- Shape at right (5s): maps to color 6 (top-right)\n- Shape at bottom-left (7s): maps to color 4 (bottom-left)  \n- Shape at bottom-right (2s): maps to color 8 (bottom-right)\n\n**Determining dimensions:**\n- 9s shape: 8 rows \u00d7 10 cols\n- 5s shape: 12 rows \u00d7 10 cols\n- 7s shape: 6 rows \u00d7 3 cols (diagonal from wide to narrow)\n- 2s shape: 4 rows \u00d7 6 cols (diagonal from narrow to wide)\n\nOutput dimensions: approximately 12 rows \u00d7 10 cols\n\n**Constructing the output:**\n- Top-left (3s): diagonal boundary going down-right\n- Top-right (6s): fills the top-right region\n- Bottom-left (4s): shaped by 7s pattern (narrow at bottom)\n- Bottom-right (8s): shaped by 2s pattern (wide at bottom), fills center\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,8,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,8,8,8,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6\n3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\nIn both examples, I notice:\n1. One shape contains a 2\u00d72 pattern of unique colors (the \"key\" shape)\n2. There are 3 other colored shapes in different quadrants\n3. The output fills regions with the 4 colors from the 2\u00d72 pattern\n4. Each shape's position (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) determines which pattern color fills it\n\n**Example 1:** The 2s shape contains pattern [1,5 / 8,9]. The output places:\n- 1 (top-left of pattern) \u2192 region from the 2s shape (top-left position)\n- 5 (top-right) \u2192 region from 7s shape (top-right)\n- 8 (bottom-left) \u2192 region from 4s shape (bottom-left)  \n- 9 (bottom-right) \u2192 region from 3s shape (bottom-right, fills gaps)\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nThe 9s shape (rows 4-11, cols 3-12) contains the 2\u00d72 pattern:\n```\n3,6\n4,8\n```\n\nOther shapes and their positions:\n- 9s shape (contains pattern): top-left region \u2192 color 3\n- 5s shape: right side of grid \u2192 color 6\n- 7s shape (rows 19-24, cols 3-5): bottom-left \u2192 color 4\n- 2s shape (rows 20-23, cols 17-22): bottom-right \u2192 color 8\n\n**Building the Output:**\n\nThe 9s shape is U-shaped (8 rows \u00d7 10 cols) with internal gaps. The 5s shape fills the right portion (12 rows). The 7s is L-shaped. The 2s is triangular.\n\nI'll combine these shapes:\n- Rows 0-7: 9s shape (color 3) with gaps filled by 6 (from 5s pattern position)\n- Rows 8-11: 7s L-shape (color 4) on left, 2s triangular (color 8) fills remaining\n- Color 8 fills overlapping/gap regions (as bottom-right color)\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3\n3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3\n3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",
