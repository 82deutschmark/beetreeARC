            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, here's my understanding of how to solve these ARC tasks:**\n\nThe user has given me an ARC task involving image transformations. After reviewing example 1 and the test input, I've figured out the core principle: we're dealing with a \"collage\" or \"layering\" of image objects within a grid, but not in a simple way. The input objects are assigned to quadrants, and their colors are defined by a container object in the input grid. I will need to predict the output image.\n\n**Key Observations and Rules:**\n\n1.  **Object Roles:** The input objects function as image \"paint buckets\". In the ARC task, we divide the output into quadrants. The container's internal structure and seeds determine the layout and color.\n\n2.  **Output Size:** The output size isn't directly related to container size. The output width is equal to the bounding boxes of the objects on the top row; the output height is the sum of the bounding box of the top object and bottom objects. In some cases, the height may be truncated.\n\n3.  **Color Determination:** The output regions are filled by colors from internal elements of the container. Inside the Container object are 2x2 or 4 Seed pixels representing colors. A seed color is assigned to each quadrant.\n\n4.  **Layout:** The Input grid will be divided into 4 quadrants. Each output grid Quadrant will be assigned to colors by its seeds. The size of the objects in the other quadrants will be assigned to determine the output grid, the grid may be clipped/reduced.\n\n    *   **TL** (Top-Left): Shape determined by the Container Mask. Color from the TL seed in the container.  It also fills the empty space in the TL quadrant.\n    *   **TR** (Top-Right): Shape of Object, Color from TR seed in container. Placed adjacent to TL, right-aligned to the container.\n    *   **BL** (Bottom-Left): Shape of object, Color from BL Seed from Container. Placed below TL, Left aligned.\n    *   **BR** (Bottom-Right): Shape of object, Color from BR Seed from Container. Aligned to the BL object, the bottom right-aligned to BL and the right edge of TR.\n\n5.  **Overlay:** The TL shape is usually on top. The background is the BR object, which is \"invisible\" to the eye.\n\n**How to solve a new task:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the container object and the other 3 objects. Check the container for the colors. Identify the seed color for each quadrant.\n\n2.  **Determine Output Size:**  Calculate width. The Grid Width=TL.W + TR.W\n    Calculate height: H=TL.H + BL.H.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Place the background object at 0 in the TL region.\n    *   Draw the TL object in the TL region.\n    *   Draw the TR object by positioning it adjacent to the TL object on the right side.\n    *   Draw the BL object below and aligned to TL, and use any space below TL to draw the shape.\n    *   Draw the BR object below and right of BL.\n\nNow, let's start coding this up.\n\n\nTo solve the ARC task, I have analyzed the solved examples and the test input to deduce the underlying transformation rule.\n\n**Reasoning Summary:**\n1.  **Input Decomposition:** The input grids contain a \"Container\" object (identified by having specific \"noise\" pixels inside it) and three other distinct colored objects. The spatial arrangement of these four objects corresponds to four quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n2.  **Seed Mapping:** The \"noise\" pixels inside the Container form a 2x2 pattern of \"Seeds\". These seeds define the **Color** to be used for the corresponding quadrant in the output grid.\n    *   TL Seed -> Color for TL Region.\n    *   TR Seed -> Color for TR Region.\n    *   BL Seed -> Color for BL Region.\n    *   BR Seed -> Color for BR Region.\n3.  **Geometry and Layout:** The Output Grid is a composition of the shapes (masks) of the four input objects.\n    *   The grid is divided into four regions. The dimensions of the regions are determined by the bounding boxes of the input objects.\n    *   Specifically, the **TL Object** (which is also the Container) sets the width of the left column (`W_left`) and the height of the top row (`H_top`).\n    *   The **TR Object** sets the width of the right column (`W_right`).\n    *   The **BL Object** sets the height of the bottom row (`H_bottom`).\n    *   **Output Grid Size:** Width = `W_left` + `W_right`. Height = `H_top` + `H_bottom`.\n4.  **Drawing Rule:** For each quadrant, the mask of the corresponding source object (its non-zero pixels within its bounding box) is drawn in the corresponding region's specific color.\n    *   **Background:** The background of the output grid is filled with the color of the **BR Seed**. Any \"empty\" space in the object masks (pixels that were 0 in the input bounding box) takes this background color.\n    *   **Mask Application:**\n        *   TL Region (at `0,0`): Draws TL Object Mask in TL Seed Color.\n        *   TR Region (at `W_left, 0`): Draws TR Object Mask in TR Seed Color.\n        *   BL Region (at `0, H_top`): Draws BL Object Mask in BL Seed Color.\n        *   BR Region (at `W_left, H_top`): Draws BR Object Mask in BR Seed Color.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Objects & Seeds:**\n    *   **Container (TL Object):** Maroon shape. Bounding Box: 10x8 (Width 10, Height 8).\n        *   Inside Seeds: Green (3), Magenta (6), Yellow (4), Teal (8).\n        *   **TL Seed:** Green (3).\n        *   **TR Seed:** Magenta (6).\n        *   **BL Seed:** Yellow (4).\n        *   **BR Seed:** Teal (8).\n    *   **TR Object:** Gray shape. Bounding Box: 10x12 (Width 10). (Cropped to fit canvas or canvas expands? Based on Ex 1, top row height is fixed by TL Object height. We use `H_top = 8`). Mask is taken from the first 8 rows of the Gray object.\n    *   **BL Object:** Orange shape. Bounding Box: 3x6 (Width 3, Height 6).\n    *   **BR Object:** Red shape. Bounding Box: 6x4 (Width 6, Height 4).\n*   **Dimensions:**\n    *   `W_left` = 10 (from TL).\n    *   `W_right` = 10 (from TR). Total Width = 20.\n    *   `H_top` = 8 (from TL).\n    *   `H_bottom` = 6 (from BL). Total Height = 14.\n    *   Grid Size: 20x14.\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   TL: Green (3).\n    *   TR: Magenta (6).\n    *   BL: Yellow (4).\n    *   BR: Teal (8) (Same as Background).\n*   **Construction:**\n    *   **Background:** Fill 20x14 with Teal (8).\n    *   **TL Region (0,0):** Draw Maroon Container mask in Green (3).\n    *   **TR Region (10,0):** Draw Gray Object mask (top 8 rows) in Magenta (6).\n    *   **BL Region (0,8):** Draw Orange Object mask in Yellow (4).\n    *   **BR Region (10,8):** Draw Red Object mask in Teal (8). (Since color is Teal and background is Teal, this shape is effectively invisible/merged).\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis of a Complex ARC Task and Construction of a Solution**\n\nI'm tasked with solving an ARC puzzle based on example inputs and applying the logic to a new test case. The instructions are initially confusing, with contradictions about whether to provide an explanation or just the final grid. However, after careful consideration of the system and user prompts, I've determined that providing both a detailed explanation and the output grid is the intended behavior. The key is to analyze the relationship between input shapes, their positions, and the resulting output grid.\n\nI start by meticulously examining the provided examples. The puzzle seems to involve extracting and transforming shapes from the input grid and arranging them in a predictable manner on the output canvas. I identify the \u201cKey\u201d shape (often containing a unique arrangement of colors) as a central element. This key, typically in the top-left quadrant, dictates the mapping of shapes to colors, effectively linking the quadrants to the output grid's arrangement. The output\u2019s dimensions are calculated from the combined size and transformation of these component shapes.\n\nEach shape in the original grid is extracted and its spatial transformation is assessed. These shapes are then placed onto the final canvas, which has a size that\u2019s a combination of these transformations. For example, if the top-right needs to be rotated 90 degrees, its original height, after the rotation, becomes the width that\u2019s added to calculate the total output width. The overlapping colors determine which colour shows in the output grid.\n\nThe goal is to generate an output grid and to reconstruct the solution logic. In the test input, I break down the task into smaller steps:\n\n1.  **Identify quadrants:** divide the input grid into four quadrants, each containing a main object.\n2.  **Locate the Key:** Find the shape that includes a set of distinctive colours (3, 6, 4 and 8 in the test input). The values within it map to corresponding quadrants.\n3.  **Establish Transformation Logic:** Determine the specific spatial rotation (often 90 degrees) for each shape.\n4.  **Calculate the Canvas Size:**  I calculate the output width by adding width of the top-left shape with height of the top-right shape, and the height with adding the height of the top-left with height of the bottom-left.\n5.  **Translate Shapes to Colors:** Use the colour key (quadrants mapped to shapes) to find the correct colors.\n6.  **Recreate the Output Grid:** Create the final output grid, placing the shapes on the defined grid.\n\nApplying this logic to the test input, I generate the output grid by correctly placing each transformed input shape and assign the correct colour to it. I carefully assess the rotations and positions to ensure that they are in line with the logic derived from the examples and the overall instructions of the ARC puzzle.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples, the transformation follows a hierarchical logic:\n1.  **Decomposition:** The input grid is divided into four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). Each quadrant contains a distinct \"foreground\" object.\n2.  **Key Extraction:** One of the objects acts as a \"Key Holder\" (identifiable by containing a 2x2 arrangement of four distinct \"intruder\" colors). The spatial arrangement of these intruder colors defines the coloring of the output objects.\n    *   Top-Left Intruder -> Color for the Top-Left Object.\n    *   Top-Right Intruder -> Color for the Top-Right Object.\n    *   Bottom-Left Intruder -> Color for the Bottom-Left Object.\n    *   Bottom-Right Intruder -> Color for the Bottom-Right Object.\n3.  **Transformation & Assembly:** The output grid is constructed by transforming and assembling the four objects:\n    *   **Canvas Size:** The output width is the sum of the width of the TL object and the *height* of the TR object (implying 90\u00b0 rotation). The output height is the sum of the height of the TL object and the height of the BL object.\n    *   **Top-Left (TL) Object:** Copied as-is (no rotation) to the top-left corner (0,0). Colored with the TL-key color.\n    *   **Top-Right (TR) Object:** Rotated 90\u00b0 Clockwise and placed adjacent to the right of the TL object. Colored with the TR-key color.\n    *   **Bottom-Left (BL) Object:** Copied as-is (no rotation) and placed adjacent below the TL object. Colored with the BL-key color.\n    *   **Bottom-Right (BR) Object:** Rotated 90\u00b0 Clockwise and placed in the bottom-right corner of the canvas. Colored with the BR-key color. Priority is given to this object in case of overlaps (inferred from Example 1).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **TL Object:** Maroon shape (containing Key). Shape is a 10x8 rectangle. Key colors: 3 (TL), 6 (TR), 4 (BL), 8 (BR). **Output TL:** Color 3 (Green), Size 10x8.\n*   **TR Object:** Grey shape. A \"tree\" pointing up (Stem 2px wide, Cap triangle). Bounding box 10x12. **Output TR:** Rotated 90\u00b0 CW (pointing right). Color 6 (Pink). Position starts at column 10.\n*   **BL Object:** Orange shape. A \"flag\" (3x6). **Output BL:** Color 4 (Yellow). Position starts at row 8.\n*   **BR Object:** Red shape. A right triangle (6x4). **Output BR:** Rotated 90\u00b0 CW. Color 8 (Teal). Positioned in the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0",

The output is a square grid where:\n   - Area = sum of all shape cell counts\n   - Each shape fills a region with its corresponding key color\n\n**Key-to-Shape Mapping:**\n- The key container \u2192 Top-left key color\n- The shapes map to quadrant colors based on position (with diagonal swaps for bottom shapes)\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nThe key is at rows 5-6, cols 4-5 with colors:\n```\n3,6\n4,8\n```\n\nCounting the shapes:\n- Key container (color 9 border): 52 cells\n- Shape 5 (right side): 62 cells  \n- Shape 7 (lower-left): 12 cells\n- Shape 2 (lower-right): 18 cells\n\nTotal: 52 + 62 + 12 + 18 = 144 = 12\u00d712\n\n**Color Assignments:**\n- Color 3 (TL key): Key container shape (52 cells) - top-left\n- Color 6 (TR key): Shape 5 (62 cells) - fills gaps and remaining\n- Color 4 (BL key): Shape 2 (18 cells) - bottom-left\n- Color 8 (BR key): Shape 7 (12 cells) - bottom-right\n\n**Construction:**\n\nThe key container occupies rows 0-7 with a specific shape (including internal gaps). The gaps get filled with color 6. The bottom 4 rows contain colors 4, 6, and 8 arranged to match the input shapes (rotated appropriately).\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6\n3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6\n3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this ARC task, I need to analyze the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\nIn both examples, I observe:\n1. There's a \"key pattern\" with a colored border (2s or 6s) containing a 2\u00d72 interior of 4 distinct colors\n2. Three other colored shapes are positioned in different quadrants of the input\n3. The output combines these elements: the 4 colors from the 2\u00d72 key fill four quadrants with diagonal boundaries\n\n**Key Pattern in Test Input:**\n- The 9s form the border shape (rows 4-11, cols 3-12)\n- The 2\u00d72 key inside contains: 3,6 (top), 4,8 (bottom)\n\n**Other Shapes:**\n- 5s (upper-right area): Complex shape, ~12 rows \u00d7 10 cols\n- 7s (lower-left area): L-shaped, 6 rows \u00d7 3 cols\n- 2s (lower-right area): Triangular, 4 rows \u00d7 6 cols\n\n**Quadrant Assignment:**\n- 3 (top-left of key) \u2192 fills upper-left quadrant\n- 6 (top-right of key) \u2192 fills upper-right quadrant  \n- 4 (bottom-left of key) \u2192 fills lower-left quadrant (follows 7s L-shape)\n- 8 (bottom-right of key) \u2192 fills lower-right and extends diagonally\n\n**Output Construction:**\nBased on the shapes' dimensions and the diagonal pattern from the key border opening to the lower-right, I construct a 12\u00d710 output where:\n- 8 extends diagonally from upper-center toward lower portions\n- 4 follows the L-shape pattern (3 cols narrowing to 1 col going down)\n- 6 fills the upper-right region\n- 3 fills the upper-left corner\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,8,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6\n3,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,6,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nI need to solve an ARC task based on examples. The goal is to transform one grid into another. Let's analyze the first example.\n\nI started by looking at the input and output grids. The input has four distinct shapes, each with a different color. The output is smaller and seems to be a combination of colored regions. The output colors (1, 5, 8, 9) correspond to specific pixels within the input grid's top-left shape (red, in this case). The arrangement of these colors in the input seems to relate to the positions of the shapes on the larger grid.\n\nInitially, I thought the output shapes were scaled-up versions of the input shapes. However, they don't exactly match. The shapes in the output seem to be \"pasted\" together to form an 8x8 grid. There's a mapping: input shape to output region, and the color of each output region is determined by the \"code\" inside the red shape.  The output grid is a puzzle of these colored regions. The colors seem to be based on a 2x2 block within the red shape, with their positions indicating which shape gets which color.  The task involved a transformation where the shapes were reorganized and the colors were replaced by the \"code\" pixels.\n\nI then moved onto the second example. The shapes were in different colors and positions, but the basic idea remained the same: input shapes transformed into output regions based on a 2x2 \"code\" block inside the top-left shape. I noticed the output size was 10x10, the input was 20x20. I began to form a hypothesis: could the input shapes be scaled by a factor of 2?  In other words, a 2x2 block of input pixels becomes one pixel in the output. I tried testing this theory, but quickly realized it didn't fully explain the transformations. The sizes and number of pixels in the input and output shapes didn't proportionally align with the 2x2 to 1x1 scaling hypothesis.\n\nIt seemed like the task required removing the empty space.  In Ex 2, there was an irregular shape (grey) that was not a perfect rectangle, so the scaling wasn't a simple ratio. Removing the black space still left the input grid size to be something other than the output grid size. Also the shapes in the inputs had \"holes\" (such as the pink shape in Example 2 which contained the code pixels). But in the outputs, those holes where replaced by the solid color of the shape, or code's color.\n\nMoving to the test input, and reexamining how the 2x2 block related to the shape position and corresponding colors.  I confirmed the color assignment logic. The shapes in the output seemed to be a collage of the shapes. \n\nI discarded simple rules about scaling or rotation and instead focused on bounding boxes.  By bounding boxes, I mean that the output had dimensions to fit the input shapes' combined area, and that the shapes filled the space perfectly in the output.\n\nAfter further analysis, I began to think the output grid was a transformed, possibly resized version of the input layout.  The shapes might be simply moved and re-sized to fit together, and the output colors depend on the mapping from those 2x2 code pixel blocks.\n\nI identified the key aspects.  I believed the output size might be derived from a relationship between the \"code block,\" or sum of widths and heights or some combination of dimensions. The canvas size of the output might be related to the source dimensions, possibly the combined size or bounding box size of the shapes. This lead to trying different calculations of bounding box dimensions and relating them to each example's sizes.\n\nI needed an example of how the shapes would be joined in the output. I also realized that some shapes had similar pixel structure, such as the two shapes resembling an \"L\" shape. After calculating the dimension of bounding boxes and adding to create the output dimensions, I came to the conclusion, I could map the shapes from the input to the output.\n\nI hypothesized there was a specific transformation rule. I concluded the output was a collage of the four input shapes. I considered removing empty rows/cols in the input to produce an output grid. I had to solve a series of examples, so I could use them to test the output's size.  I deduced that the output size was half of the input size: 26 -> 13.\nI created a plan to construct a 20x20 output grid.\n\nI decided that, since the inputs have gaps, and the output is a closed block, I needed to fill the gaps. The gaps between the shapes were an important detail. I hypothesized that the final shape would be a collage with the code colours within the shapes. I concluded that I needed to\n\nThe problem asks us to transform an input grid containing four colored shapes into a smaller output grid composed of four colored regions. The transformation involves three main steps: determining the output colors, determining the output grid size, and mapping the shape geometries.\n\n**1. Color Mapping Strategy**\nIn each example, the top-left \"container\" shape holds a 2x2 block of \"code\" pixels that dictate the color palette for the output.\n*   **Example 1:** The Red (2) container has inner pixels: `1, 5` (top row) and `8, 9` (bottom row).\n    *   Top-Left (TL) shape maps to Top-Left code color: Red shape -> **1 (Blue)**.\n    *   Top-Right (TR) shape maps to Top-Right code color: Orange shape -> **5 (Grey)**.\n    *   Bottom-Left (BL) shape maps to Bottom-Left code color: Yellow shape -> **8 (Teal)**.\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR) shape maps to Bottom-Right code color: Green shape -> **9 (Maroon)**.\n\n*   **Example 2:** The Pink (6) container has inner pixels `2, 4` and `8, 3`.\n    *   TL Pink shape -> **2 (Red)**.\n    *   TR Grey shape -> **4 (Yellow)**.\n    *   BL Maroon shape -> **8 (Teal)**.\n    *   BR Blue shape -> **3 (Green)**.\n\n*   **Test Input:** The Maroon (9) container has inner pixels `3, 6` and `4, 8`.\n    *   TL Maroon shape -> **3 (Green)**.\n    *   TR Grey shape -> **6 (Pink)**.\n    *   BL Orange shape -> **4 (Yellow)**.\n    *   BR Red shape -> **8 (Teal)**.\n\n**2. Geometry and Grid Size**\nThe output grid appears to be constructed by removing the empty rows and columns that separate the four shapes in the input grid. This effectively \"squeezes\" the shapes together.\n*   **Test Input Analysis:**\n    *   **Columns:** The TL and BL shapes occupy columns 3-12 (width 10). The TR and BR shapes occupy columns 16-25 (width 10). There is a gap of 3 columns (13-15). Removing the gap results in a width of 10 + 10 = **20**.\n    *   **Rows:** The TL and TR shapes occupy rows 4-17 (height 14). The BL and BR shapes occupy rows 19-24 (height 6). There is a gap at row 18. Removing the gap results in a height of 14 + 6 = **20**.\n    *   **Output Size:** 20x20.\n\n**3. Pixel Mapping**\nWe iterate through the calculated 20x20 output grid and map each coordinate back to the input grid, skipping the identified gap rows and columns.\n*   **Output Columns 0-9:** Map to Input Columns 3-12.\n*   **Output Columns 10-19:** Map to Input Columns 16-25.\n*   **Output Rows 0-13:** Map to Input Rows 4-17.\n*   **Output Rows 14-19:** Map to Input Rows 19-24.\n\nFor each mapped pixel:\n*   If the input pixel belongs to the TL shape (Maroon/9 or inner pixels), output **3 (Green)**.\n*   If the input pixel belongs to the TR shape (Grey/5), output **6 (Pink)**.\n*   If the input pixel belongs to the BL shape (Orange/7), output **4 (Yellow)**.\n*   If the input pixel belongs to the BR shape (Red/2), output **8 (Teal)**.\n*   Background pixels (0) map to 0.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   **TL (Green):** Fills the top-left quadrant defined by the Maroon shape's mask.\n*   **TR (Pink):** Fills the top-right quadrant defined by the Grey shape's mask.\n*   **BL (Yellow):** Fills the bottom-left defined by the Orange shape.\n*   **BR (Teal):** Fills the bottom-right defined by the Red shape.\n\nThe resulting grid is 20x20.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0\n3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0\n4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0\n4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Shape Composition and Color Mapping**\n\nThe user wants me to solve an ARC task that involves taking two example grids and a test grid, and generate an output grid. My focus is on understanding the underlying logic to generate the output from the input.\n\n**Initial Impressions:**\n\n*   I need to analyze how the input grid is transformed into the output grid.\n*   Two examples are given to provide hints for solving a single test case.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\n*   The input grid is divided into four regions containing distinct shapes (shapes 2, 7, 4, and 3).\n*   There's a special object containing a key (a 2x2 block with unique colors).\n*   The output grid contains solid shapes of unique colors.\n*   The \"key\" likely drives how shapes are translated to the colors of the output, but the exact mapping is unclear.\n*   The shapes in the output grid appear to correspond to solidified versions of the input shapes.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n\n*   I'll identify the four main input shapes.\n*   Figure out the output color of each region based on the position of each shape relative to the key inside the special TL shape.\n*   The \"key\" pixels in the special object determine the output color of each shape based on its location in the input.\n*   Each output region's color matches a color in the key object's 2x2 block.\n\n**Testing Hypothesis:**\n\n*   I need to check how the input shapes map to the output shapes and colors.\n*   I'll analyze the shapes and their bounding boxes and see if there are any rotations or translations applied.\n*   I realize that the shapes appear to be **packed** into the output grid.\n*   The output grid's size isn't obviously the sum of input shapes, but they touch to fill the 8x8 space.\n\n**Refining Logic:**\n\n*   I'll need to figure out how to arrange the shapes based on the color mapping. The shapes' positions in the output seem tied to the shapes' relative position with respect to the key in the input.\n*   The size of the output is determined by fitting these shapes together.\n*   There's no overlap in the output (shapes are pushed to touch).\n*   I see that the output can be constructed by drawing the shapes (solid) and coloring based on position relative to the special key object.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   I extend my theory to cover the second example.\n*   I test whether this \"quadrant\" hypothesis is still valid.\n*   I re-examine the Key object (in this example, it's not at the top-left).\n*   I confirm the color mapping principle remains the same.\n*   I test that solidified shapes are being transformed.\n*   I notice some shapes are rotated (to better fit).\n*   I test whether shape geometry is preserved.\n\n**Formulating the Rules:**\n\n*   Identify the 4 shapes and extract them.\n*   Apply the key (solidify shapes and recolor according to position).\n*   Arrange the 4 shapes into a solid rectangle (no whitespace).\n\n**New Insights:**\n\n*   The shapes in the output are all rectangular or \"filled-in\" shapes from the input.\n*   There's no blank space in the output.\n*   I need to find a way to place the shapes that maximizes the \"touching\" and fills the whole area.\n*   I am able to deduce that for Ex 1, rotating the TR shape helped the shapes fit.\n\n**Test Input Approach:**\n\n*   I'll identify the four shapes and extract them from the Test Input.\n*   I identify the key colors (3, 6, 4, 8) and assign them to the regions.\n*   I note that the height of each quadrant in the output is probably going to be equal to the corresponding shape (although this has not been consistent).\n*   I'll use the shapes to generate a final output (pushing the shapes into a grid).\n*   I try to create a grid with width 20, but the best approach is to have width equal to the combined width of the solid shape after rotating. This might result in scaling.\n\n**Final Plan and Test:**\n\n*   Generate the final layout.\n*   Apply rotation (or simply placement with color fills if there's sufficient space).\n*   I make a table to generate the 20x20 Output (applying the derived logic).\n*   I check whether BL/BR shapes should be cropped.\n*   I generate the final output and color the grid as 20x20, using the solid shapes.\n\nThe final output is a \n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid into an output grid based on the pattern established in the solved examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid contains four distinct shapes positioned roughly in the four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n2.  **Key Identification:** One of the shapes (the Top-Left one in all examples) contains a 2x2 \"key\" of pixels with different colors. This key acts as a color map for the output.\n    *   The 2x2 key layout `[[TL_color, TR_color], [BL_color, BR_color]]` determines the fill color for the four shapes based on their quadrant.\n    *   Top-Left Shape $\\rightarrow$ becomes `TL_color`.\n    *   Top-Right Shape $\\rightarrow$ becomes `TR_color`.\n    *   Bottom-Left Shape $\\rightarrow$ becomes `BL_color`.\n    *   Bottom-Right Shape $\\rightarrow$ becomes `BR_color`.\n3.  **Geometry and Assembly:**\n    *   The output grid combines these four shapes into a single rectangular (specifically square) block.\n    *   The shapes effectively form a tiling or packing of the output square.\n    *   The dimensions of the output grid seem to be determined by the sum of the widths of the top two shapes (Top-Left + Top-Right) and maintaining a square aspect ratio (or fitting the heights).\n    *   In the test input:\n        *   **Top-Left Object (Source Color 9):** A 10x8 solid block.\n        *   **Top-Right Object (Source Color 5):** A 10x12 solid block.\n        *   **Bottom-Left Object (Source Color 7):** A smaller shape.\n        *   **Bottom-Right Object (Source Color 2):** A smaller shape.\n    *   The Key inside the Top-Left object is:\n        ```\n        3 6\n        4 8\n        ```\n        *   TL Target Color: **3 (Green)**.\n        *   TR Target Color: **6 (Magenta)**.\n        *   BL Target Color: **4 (Yellow)**.\n        *   BR Target Color: **8 (Light Blue)**.\n4.  **Layout Construction:**\n    *   The output width is the sum of the widths of the top two blocks: $10 + 10 = 20$.\n    *   The output height is inferred to be a square matching the width, so $20 \\times 20$.\n    *   **Top-Left (Green):** Occupies the top-left corner.

The output is created by:\n   - Taking the 4 colors from the 2\u00d72 grid inside the key shape\n   - Each quadrant of the output gets filled with one of these colors\n   - The shapes of the quadrants match the shapes of the input objects\n   - The position mapping: input shapes get assigned to output quadrants based on their spatial location\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nThe key shape (color 9) contains a 2\u00d72 at positions (5,4)-(6,5):\n- Top-left: 3 (green)\n- Top-right: 6 (magenta)  \n- Bottom-left: 4 (yellow)\n- Bottom-right: 8 (azure)\n\nOther shapes and their mappings:\n- Shape 7 (orange) at bottom-left input \u2192 top-left output \u2192 color 3\n- Shape 5 (gray) at right input \u2192 top-right output \u2192 color 6\n- Shape 9 (key) at top-left input \u2192 bottom-left output \u2192 color 4\n- Shape 2 (red) at bottom-right input \u2192 bottom-right output \u2192 color 8\n\nThe shapes tile together with diagonal staircase boundaries matching the original shape profiles.\n\n**Output Construction:**\n\nBased on the shapes' dimensions (orange: 6\u00d73 L-shape, gray: 12\u00d710 complex, key: 8\u00d710 complex, red: 4\u00d76 staircase), the output combines these with diagonal boundaries.\n\n```\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Decomposition and Solution Strategy**\n\nThe user has presented me with an ARC task involving grid transformations, and I've started breaking down the problem. The goal is to generate a smaller output grid from a larger input grid containing colored regions. The process looks like a partitioning of the input into regions based on the Manhattan distance from key \"seed\" points.\n\nFirst, I identified key patterns: distinct, colored clusters within the input grid, and a consistent output grid filled with a smaller set of colors (no 0s). The hint of four disconnected clusters (seeds) with embedded colors are very important. The output grid size relates to the input, but not always through simple scaling.\n\nI delved into the hints, noting the \"staircase-like\" boundaries, which suggests Manhattan distance (Voronoi) propagation from the \"seed\" clusters to determine each output region. The problem boils down to correctly identifying the seeds and determining the correct size of the output grid.\n\nI recognized the four clusters as the starting points. I saw they had a palette of interior colors. For Example 1, I noted the TL cluster has the \"palette\". In Example 2, the TL cluster has the interior palette. From the palette colors, the quadrant in the Output is color-coded.\n\nThis led me to hypothesize the key to the task: The key is to identify the \"palette\" cluster and then map the quadrent seed cluster. Example 1 showed the output was colored with the interior 2x2.\n\nI need the dimensions of the output grid. In this, I observed the output region colors don't match input colors, which is logical. Using two example output grids, I tried several options for generating the output dimensions, focusing on counts, bounding boxes of colored cells in input, and the gaps between clusters. However, no clear relationship emerged. I made the following hypothesis about how the Output is generated: The input can be \"scaled down\" by a factor of 2. I need to test for the final solution, but for the Test input, the number of columns and rows could be different. I could take a scale of `(W-padding)/2` for width and `(H-padding)/2` for height.\n\nI need to confirm the algorithm. With Test Input, I'll take a BBox size of `22, 21`. I should try a scaled grid of `11x11`.\n\nI must define where these \"seed\" locations should be, on the smaller output grid. My guess is that the centroid scaled down, is the starting point on the scaled grid for each cluster.\n\nThe plan now is:\n1.  **Extract the Palette.** Identify the four color cluster with an embedded palette. Map the palette colors to output regions in a TL-TR-BL-BR fashion.\n2.  **Define Output Grid Size.** Divide the Input Bounding Box by a scale of 2. Use this, combined with padding where necessary.\n3.  **Find Seed Locations.** Based on BBox centroids, scale the coordinates of the cluster centroids relative to the new Output Grid.\n4.  **Perform Voronoi/Growth Simulation**. On the scaled grid, perform Manhattan Distance from these seeds. Generate the output based on this.\n\nI'm ready to begin the test with this plan.\n\nTo solve the test input, for the final output grid, I will generate the Voronoi regions with 11x11, the dimensions. The TL will be green, the TR will be Magenta, the BL will be Yellow, the BR will be Teal. The code will be ready.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a large grid containing four colored clusters into a smaller, fully filled grid partitioned into four regions. The solution involves identifying the \"seeds\", extracting the color palette, determining the output grid dimensions, and generating the partition based on Manhattan distance (growth).\n\n### 1. Identifying Seeds and Palette\nThere are four distinct clusters in the input grid.\n- **Top-Left (TL):** Maroon (9) cluster.\n- **Top-Right (TR):** Grey (5) cluster.\n- **Bottom-Left (BL):** Orange (7) cluster.\n- **Bottom-Right (BR):** Red (2) cluster.\n\nOne of these clusters acts as the \"Palette Cluster\". In the solved examples, this is the cluster containing a 2x2 multicolor pattern embedded within it.\nLooking at the Test Input, the Maroon (9) cluster (TL) contains:\n- Row 5: `... 9, 3, 6, 9 ...`\n- Row 6: `... 9, 4, 8, 9 ...`\nThe embedded palette is:\n```\n3 6\n4 8\n```\nThese colors correspond to the four quadrants of the output relative to the seed positions:\n- **TL Color:** 3 (Green)\n- **TR Color:** 6 (Magenta)\n- **BL Color:** 4 (Yellow)\n- **BR Color:** 8 (Teal)\n\n### 2. Determining Output Dimensions\nIn the examples, the output grid size is approximately half the dimensions of the bounding box of the active input area.\n- **Example 1:** Input BBox ~16x17. Output 8x8. (Scaling factor ~0.5).\n- **Example 2:** Input BBox ~18x18. Output 10x10. (Scaling factor ~0.55).\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- The active clusters span from Column 3 to 24 (Width = 22).\n- They span from Row 4 to 24 (Height = 21).\n- Applying the scaling logic (roughly half):\n  - Width: 22 / 2 = 11.\n  - Height: 21 / 2 = 10.5 -> We will use 11 for a square-ish result, matching the aspect ratio closely. Let's select **11x11** as the output grid size.\n\n### 3. Determining Seed Locations\nWe map the centroids of the input clusters to the new 11x11 grid coordinate system.\n- **TL Cluster:** Centered approx at (7, 7) in input. Relative to BBox origin (3,4): (4, 3). Scaled by 0.5: **(2, 2)**.\n- **TR Cluster:** Centered approx at (21, 11). Relative: (18, 7). Scaled: **(9, 3)**.\n- **BL Cluster:** Centered approx at (4, 21). Relative: (1, 17). Scaled: **(1, 9)**.\n- **BR Cluster:** Centered approx at (19, 21). Relative: (16, 17). Scaled: **(8, 9)**.\n\n### 4. Generating the Partition (Voronoi)\nWe assign each cell in the 11x11 grid the color of the closest seed using Manhattan distance ($|x_1-x_2| + |y_1-y_2|$).\n\n**Seeds:**\n- **3 (Green):** (2, 2)\n- **6 (Magenta):** (9, 3)\n- **4 (Yellow):** (1, 9)\n- **8 (Teal):** (8, 9)\n\n**Boundaries:**\n- **Left vs Right (3 vs 6):** Midpoint $x \\approx 5.5$. Split at index 5/6.\n- **Left vs Right (4 vs 8):** Midpoint $x \\approx 4.5$. Split at index 4/5.\n- **Top vs Bottom (3 vs 4):** Midpoint $y \\approx 5.5$. Split at index 5/6.\n- **Top vs Bottom (6 vs 8):** Midpoint $y \\approx 6.0$. Split at index 6.\n\nThis creates a partition where:\n- **Top-Left** is Green (3).\n- **Top-Right** is Magenta (6).\n- **Bottom-Left** is Yellow (4).\n- **Bottom-Right** is Teal (8).\n\nThe boundaries will be staircase-like due to the discrete Manhattan distance calculations.\n\noutput:\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Comprehensive Task Analysis and Solution Strategy**\n\nMy primary objective is to solve an ARC task that presents a series of inputs and corresponding outputs, with the goal of generalizing the underlying pattern to a novel input. I've broken this down into several key steps and observations:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Input/Output Relationship:** I start by carefully comparing the dimensions of the input and output grids (e.g., 20x20 input maps to 8x8 or 10x10 outputs). I note that the output size is smaller, suggesting a form of downsampling or a focus on a core region of the input. I also observe the recurring presence of 4 distinct clusters of non-zero pixels within each input.\n2.  **Cluster Identification and Characterization:** The inputs consistently contain 4 clusters. One of these is a \"special\" cluster because it contains pixels of multiple colors. The other 3 are usually uniform in color and form blocks.\n3.  **Special Cluster as the Key:** The most crucial element appears to be the \"special\" cluster. It contains a \"palette\" of colors (e.g., 1, 5, 8, 9). I've noted that the output grid contains pixels from the colors inside the special cluster.\n4.  **Spatial Mapping:** The output regions get assigned colors. The output region colors seem to depend on: the colors found inside the special cluster and which cluster they are found in (TL, TR, BL, BR). This suggests a mapping between the quadrants of the input and the palette color. The output grid shows \"staircase-like\" borders suggesting Manhattan distance or Voronoi diagram.\n5.  **Output Grid Generation:** The critical puzzle lies in how to determine the correct size of the output grid.\n    *   **Area Preservation Hypothesis:** The total number of pixels in the output grid might be equal to the total number of non-zero pixels in the input (Ex: 64 total pixels in Ex 1, which has 64 pixels).\n    *   **The Size Relation:** The relationship between input and output sizes is not linear and cannot be explained by simple ratios. However, some connections can be seen. For example, if you remove rows and cols, Ex 1 Input size 20x20 = output 8x8; Ex 2 input 20x20 = output 10x10. The test input is 26x26. Given the full grid \"constraint\", and pixel preservation, I will need to predict the size.\n6.  **Proposed Algorithm**:\n\n    *   **Cluster Pixel Count:** Compute the pixel count for each input cluster: top left (C1), top right (C2), bottom left (C3), and bottom right (C4).\n    *   **Find Area:** Calculate the sum of the total pixels $A = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4$\n    *   **Dimension Determination**: The total output grid dimensions (W x H) is equal to A.\n    *   **Seed Placement:** The seed locations determine region growth\n    *   **Voronoi Construction:** The main task is constructing a Manhattan distance Voronoi diagram (staircase-like borders).\n    *   **Palette assignment:** Identify the special (multi-colored) cluster and extract the four palette colors (P1, P2, P3, P4). Based on the 4 regions, assign the palette to that region.\n    *   **Final Output:** Produce the output grid using the assigned regions, ensuring that the number of pixels matches the expected pixel count for each color\n\n\nThe solution involves three main steps: identifying the output grid dimensions, determining the mapping from input clusters to output regions, and constructing the final grid based on pixel counts.\n\n**1. Determine Output Grid Dimensions**\nBy analyzing the examples, we find that the total number of non-zero pixels in the input grid equals the total area (number of cells) of the output grid.\n*   **Example 1:** Input pixel count is exactly 64. Output is 8x8 ($8 \\times 8 = 64$).\n*   **Example 2:** Input pixel count is exactly 100. Output is 10x10 ($10 \\times 10 = 100$).\n*   **Test Input:** Counting the pixels in the four clusters:\n    *   Top-Left (9s with inner detail): 52 pixels.\n    *   Top-Right (5s): 62 pixels.\n    *   Bottom-Left (7s): 12 pixels.\n    *   Bottom-Right (2s): 18 pixels.\n    *   **Total:** $52 + 62 + 12 + 18 = 144$.\n    *   Square root of 144 is 12.\n    *   **Output Grid Size:** 12x12.\n\n**2. Determine Color Mapping**\nThe \"special\" cluster (the one containing a multicolored palette) dictates the colors. The mapping rule observed in Example 1 is:\n*   TL Cluster $\\rightarrow$ TL Palette Color\n*   TR Cluster $\\rightarrow$ TR Palette Color\n*   BL Cluster $\\rightarrow$ BR Palette Color (Note the swap)\n*   BR Cluster $\\rightarrow$ BL Palette Color (Note the swap)\n\nFor the Test Input:\n*   **Special Cluster** is the Top-Left one (9s).\n*   **Palette:**\n    *   Row 5: `...9,3,6,9...` $\\rightarrow$ TL=3, TR=6.\n    *   Row 6: `...9,4,8,9...` $\\rightarrow$ BL=4, BR=8.\n*   **Mapping:**\n    *   **TL Cluster** (size 52) $\\rightarrow$ TL Color **3**.\n    *   **TR Cluster** (size 62) $\\rightarrow$ TR Color **6**.\n    *   **BL Cluster** (size 12) $\\rightarrow$ BR Color **8**.\n    *   **BR Cluster** (size 18) $\\rightarrow$ BL Color **4**.\n\n**3. Construct the Grid**\nWe partition the 12x12 grid into 4 regions with sizes matching the cluster pixel counts: Region 3 (52 px), Region 6 (62 px), Region 8 (12 px), Region 4 (18 px).\nThe regions grow from their respective corners (TL, TR, BL, BR) using Manhattan distance logic to form staircase boundaries.\n\n*   **Region 8 (BL, 12 px):** Occupies the bottom-left. A 12-pixel staircase corresponds to the bottom 3 rows of the first 2 columns and bottom 2 rows of the next 3 columns.\n    *   Rows 9-11 in Cols 0-1.\n    *   Rows 10-11 in Cols 2-4.\n*   **Region 4 (BR, 18 px):** Occupies the bottom-right. An 18-pixel staircase corresponds to the bottom 3 rows of the last 4 columns and bottom 2 rows of the preceding 3 columns.\n    *   Rows 9-11 in Cols 8-11.\n    *   Rows 10-11 in Cols 5-7.\n*   **Region 3 (TL, 52 px):** Fills the remaining Top-Left area.\n    *   Fills Cols 0-4 above Region 8.\n    *   Spills into Col 5 (top 4 rows) to reach the count of 52.\n*   **Region 6 (TR, 62 px):** Fills the remaining Top-Right area.\n    *   Fills Cols 6-11 above Region 4.\n    *   Fills Col 5 (middle rows) to reach the count of 62.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,4,4\n8,8,3,3,3,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4",

Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\n### Pair 1\n- **Input 1**\n  - A square grid with a **black background**.\n  - **Four separated colored clusters** (disconnected components):\n    1. **Top-left**: a jagged cluster primarily **red**, with several **light-blue/cyan** cells embedded/adjacent within the same local area.\n    2. **Upper-right**: a small **solid orange** square-like block.\n    3. **Lower-left**: a larger **yellow** irregular polyomino.\n    4. **Lower-right**: a **green** polyomino shaped like an \u201cL\u201d/step.\n- **Output 1**\n  - Same overall grid shape/size; **no black background remains**.\n  - The whole grid is covered by **four large, contiguous color regions**:\n    - **Blue** region in the upper-left.\n    - **Gray** region in the upper-right.\n    - **Light-blue/cyan** region in the lower-left.\n    - **Dark red/brown (maroon)** region occupying much of the right and lower portions.\n  - Region boundaries are **axis-aligned \u201cstair-step\u201d** edges.\n\n### Pair 2\n- **Input 2**\n  - A square grid with a **black background**.\n  - **Four separated colored clusters**:\n    1. **Upper-right**: a **gray** step/hook-shaped polyomino.\n    2. **Left-center**: a larger **magenta** polyomino with small **embedded cyan and green** cells inside it.\n    3. **Lower-left**: a **dark red/brown (maroon)** block with a notch-like missing area.\n    4. **Lower-right**: a **blue** blocky polyomino.\n- **Output 2**\n  - Same overall grid shape/size; **no black background remains**.\n  - The whole grid is covered by **four large contiguous regions**:\n    - **Red** region occupying much of the left/center.\n    - **Yellow** region in the upper-right.\n    - **Green** region on the right/lower-right.\n    - **Light-blue/cyan** region in the lower-left.\n  - Boundaries again are **rectilinear stair-steps**.\n\n**Overall changes from inputs to outputs**\n- The **black background is completely replaced** by colored regions.\n- The output becomes a **full partition** into 4 big regions (one per input cluster, visually).\n- **Output colors are not the same set as the big input object colors** (the output uses a different 4-color set per pair).\n- The outputs preserve **grid dimensions** and produce **connected regions** with step-like borders.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement**: **absent**\n- **Object recoloring**: **present**\n- **Bordering / outlining**: **absent**\n- **Filling holes or cavities**: **maybe** (inputs include objects with internal embedded colors/holes; unclear if \u201choles\u201d are filled vs used as signals)\n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape**: **absent**\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning**: **absent**\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**: **maybe** (regions align to large-scale positional layout)\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**: **maybe** (some small embedded colors appear important)\n- **Size-based filtering or selection**: **maybe** (could be selecting a special multicolored component)\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations**: **absent**\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**: **present** (regions look like expansions that fill all space)\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**: **absent**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **The output is a complete 4-way partition of the grid**: every cell belongs to exactly one of four large connected regions; there is no remaining \u201cbackground.\u201d\n2. **Region borders look like Manhattan/4-neighborhood influence boundaries** (stair-step edges), consistent with **simultaneous growth from multiple seeds** rather than simple rectangular splitting.\n3. **Input object body colors do not directly appear as the final region colors**; instead, the output\u2019s four colors plausibly come from **small embedded/secondary colors** present in (at least) the multicolored input component.\n4. In each input, **exactly one component is visibly multicolored** (contains small \u201cextra\u201d colors inside), suggesting it may act as a **palette/key carrier** rather than a normal seed color.\n5. The **number of output regions matches the number of disconnected input components (4)**, indicating a per-component assignment rather than per-color assignment.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nThe task likely treats the **four disconnected input components as four \u201cseeds\u201d** and expands their influence to fill the entire grid, producing a **stair-stepped partition** consistent with 4-neighbor distance growth (Voronoi-like under Manhattan distance). Before/while expanding, each seed is **assigned a new color** taken from a **palette encoded by the multicolored component** (e.g., the small internal colored cells), so the final filled regions use that palette rather than the original seed colors.\n\n(Alternate close family: the plane is partitioned by nearest-seed under Manhattan distance, with seed colors determined by a local \u201ccolor key\u201d embedded in one special object.)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks to perform when solving (validation-oriented)\n\n1. **Connected-components count**: verify there are exactly **4 foreground components** (non-background) in each input.\n2. **Palette extraction**: check whether the **set of colors used in the output** matches the **set of small embedded colors** inside the multicolored component (possibly arranged as a tiny 2\u00d72 key).\n3. **Region assignment mechanism**: simulate **multi-source BFS (Manhattan distance)** from the 4 components across the background and see if the resulting boundaries match the output stair-steps.\n4. **Color-to-seed mapping rule**: test whether seeds receive palette colors based on **relative position ranking** (e.g., top-left/top-right/bottom-left/bottom-right by centroid or bounding-box).\n5. **Tie-breaking**: if Manhattan distances tie, check whether output indicates a consistent tie rule (e.g., fixed priority order by seed position).\n\n---\n\nHINT_START\n* The four disconnected input clusters act as four \u201cseeds\u201d; the output is a full-grid 4-region partition (no background left).\n* Region borders are staircase-like, consistent with Manhattan-distance / simultaneous growth from the seeds.\n* Final region colors don\u2019t match the main seed colors; they appear to come from the special multicolored cluster\u2019s embedded palette colors.\n* Seeds likely get palette colors by their relative positions (TL/TR/BL/BR ordering) before/while filling the grid.\nHINT_END",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'd approach this ARC task.**\n\nI'm being asked to figure out a transformation based on a couple of solved examples and a test input. The goal is to take a grid of numbers and output a smaller, dense grid with the zeros removed. The key is in understanding how to find and recombine \"unique container objects,\" which seem to involve a 2x2 mosaic of distinct colors.\n\nSo, first thing's first, I gotta define the process. I see that the input grids use numbers from 0-9. The output is a smaller grid without zeros. Based on the instructions and the examples, I see I need to do a few things:\n1.  **Identify a unique \"container object.\"** This object will surround a 2x2 block of four different numbers (let's call them colors). I need to extract these colors (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) from the block.\n2.  **Combine the container and its contents**. I need to merge the shapes of this \"container\" (the object) with the enclosed content, and then re-color it all with the color from the top-left of the 2x2 mosaic. This becomes the \"TL piece.\"\n3.  **Find the other objects.** Identify all the distinct, connected objects in the input.\n4.  **Order by size.** Sort these other objects by their area (number of pixels). Assign them new \"keys\" based on their size: the smallest object becomes the BL key, the middle the TR key, and the largest the BR key.\n5.  **Calculate the output size.** Determine N by finding the square root of the total non-zero input pixels, and build an N x N grid.\n6.  **Tessellate the grid.** Finally, I take the newly created TL, TR, BL, and BR shapes, and arrange them to fill an N x N square, allowing for rotations or translations if needed to make them fit.\n\nLet's verify this logic against the examples.\n\n**Examining Example 1:**\nI'm looking at the first example to validate my thought process. There's a red shape (color 2) that contains what looks like that 2x2 \"mosaic.\" Rows 2 and 3 contain:\n```\n2 1 5 2\n2 8 9 0\n```\nSo, the 2x2 mosaic is the numbers:\n```\n1 5\n8 9\n```\nKeys: TL=1, TR=5, BL=8, BR=9.\nThe container is the red shape around that mosaic (color 2). I combine these to make a 1 region after re-coloring. Let's count it out: if I re-color the container, plus all contained pixels, there are about 15 pixels in total. It becomes a 5x5 block with a bite taken out, 15 pixels. So if I re-color the container to TL key (1), I should get a region of 1's of that shape.\nThe other objects are an orange shape (7) of size 12, a Yellow shape (4) with area 27, and a Green shape (3) with an area 11.\nSorting by area:\nGreen (3) = 11 (BL key 8).\nOrange (7) = 12 (TR key 5).\nYellow (4) = 27 (BR key 9).\n\nTotal count is 15+11+12+27 = 65 pixels.\nIs the output 8x8? Yes. It's 64.  So there is one extra pixel! After re-counting, I see that the object area calculations are slightly off. It's 15+11+12+26 = 64 pixels exactly. The output shape is 8x8 exactly. I now have confidence this works.\n\nThe tessellation places a color 1 object (red shape plus inclusions).\n\nSo, the next step is now to apply this knowledge to the input grid.\n\n**Applying the Logic to the Test Input:**\nI'm looking for this 2x2 mosaic in the provided input grid. I see:\n```\n...9,3,6,9...\n...9,4,8,9...\n```\nAh! There's my mosaic, the numbers 3, 6, 4, and 8. The container, which encloses this 2x2 block, is the '9' shape.  Let's work through it.\nKeys: TL = 3, TR = 6, BL = 4, BR = \n\nTo solve the ARC task, I will identify the objects in the input grid, determine their roles based on the transformation rules (Container, TL/TR/BL/BR pieces), and construct the output grid by tessellating these objects.\n\n**1. Analyze the Input Objects**\nThe input grid contains four distinct connected components (objects) on a background of 0:\n*   **Object A (Key 9):** A large shape constructed of 9s, containing a 2x2 mosaic of distinct colors (3, 6, 4, 8) at `input[5][4]`, `input[5][5]`, `input[6][4]`, `input[6][5]`.\n    *   **Mosaic Colors:** Top-Left (TL)=3, Top-Right (TR)=6, Bottom-Left (BL)=4, Bottom-Right (BR)=8.\n    *   **Role:** This is the **Container**. According to the rules, it merges with its inclusions. We treat the container shape as the mask of the 9s plus the inclusions.\n    *   **Color Assignment:** Merged object becomes the **TL Key Color (3)**.\n    *   **Shape:** It occupies rows 4-11 and columns 3-12 (approx). We will extract its exact mask.\n\n*   **Object B (Key 5):** A very large connected region of 5s.\n    *   **Area:** Count of pixels is 62.\n    *   **Role:** Largest of the non-container objects -> **BR Key Color (8)**.\n\n*   **Object C (Key 2):** A triangle-like shape of 2s.\n    *   **Area:** Count of pixels is 18.\n    *   **Role:** Middle area -> **TR Key Color (6)**.\n\n*   **Object D (Key 7):** A rectangular/L-shape of 7s.\n    *   **Area:** Count of pixels is 12.\n    *   **Role:** Smallest area -> **BL Key Color (4)**.\n\n**2. Transformation Logic**\n*   **Grid Size:** Total non-zero pixels = 52 (Container) + 62 (Fives) + 18 (Twos) + 12 (Sevens) = 144. Output size is $\\sqrt{144} = 12 \\times 12$.\n*   **Target Layout:**\n    *   **TL Quadrant:** Container Shape (Color 3).\n    *   **TR Quadrant:** Twos Shape (Color 6).\n    *   **BL Quadrant:** Sevens Shape (Color 4).\n    *   **BR Quadrant:** Fives Shape (Color 8).\n    *   The objects must tessellate (fit together without overlap or gaps) to form the 12x12 square. Rotations are allowed.\n\n**3. Tessellation Strategy**\n*   **Container (Color 3):** Placed at (0,0). It occupies the top-left heavily. Its shape has a \"bite\" taken out of the right side and bottom.\n*   **Twos (Color 6):** The input shape is a right triangle. Rotating it 180 degrees allows it to fit perfectly into the \"bite\" on the right side of the Container (rows 2-5).\n*   **Sevens (Color 4):** The input shape is a 3x6 block (top half 3-wide, bottom half 1-wide). Rotating it 90 degrees counter-clockwise creates a shape that fits into the bottom-left corner (rows 9-11), interlocking with the empty space left by the Container and the background.\n*   **Fives (Color 8):** This object fills the remaining space (Bottom-Right and gaps). Its large area (62) covers the BR quadrant and flows into the remaining gaps at the top-right and between the other shapes.\n\n**4. Constructing the Output Grid**\nWe initialize a 12x12 grid with Color 8 (Background/Fives), then overlay the other three shapes.\n\n*   **Layer 1 (Background):** Fill 12x12 with **8**.\n*   **Layer 2 (TL - Container):** Draw Color **3** based on the container mask at offset (0,0).\n    *   Rows 0-1: Cols 0-9.\n    *   Row 2-3: Cols 0-3, 8-9.\n    *   Row 4: Cols 0-1, 8-9.\n    *   Row 5: Cols 0-1.\n    *   Rows 6-7: Cols 0-6.\n*   **Layer 3 (TR - Twos):** Draw Color **6** (rotated 180\u00b0) into the container's cavity.\n    *   Row 2: Cols 5-7.\n    *   Row 3: Cols 4-7.\n    *   Row 4: Cols 3-7.\n    *   Row 5: Cols 2-7.\n*   **Layer 4 (BL - Sevens):** Draw Color **4** (rotated 90\u00b0 CCW) at the bottom left.\n    *   Row 9: Cols 0-2.\n    *   Row 10: Cols 0-2.\n    *   Row 11: Cols 0-5.\n\nAll remaining pixels stay **8**.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,6,6,6,3,3,8,8\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8\n3,3,8,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8\n3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,6,6,6,3,3,8,8\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8\n3,3,8,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8\n3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Algorithm Discovery and Refinement**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The core is to map shapes onto a new grid. I need to take the input and transform it into a well-defined output, based on a few rules and examples.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input and break it down. It's a grid with shapes of different colors, on a black background. The output is a smaller solid grid with tessellated shapes. I've got two examples to guide me. I noticed I need to identify the objects by color and shape. There's a special object to start with: the container object, which encloses a 2x2 mosaic of distinct colors. Inside, the container's the shape formed by the enclosing color, plus the inner colors. I'm calling the colors inside \"keys\".\n\nThe task seems to be about decomposing the input into parts, re-coloring those parts, and then fitting them into a new grid. This involves shape extraction, area calculation, sorting, and geometric placement. Based on the examples, I know that the areas of shapes need to be computed and then used for the final structure. The largest shapes are used for anchor positions and the smaller shapes are placed around them. I can assume the final structure is a regular square shape, that's being created by tessellation.\n\nThe \"container\" object is special. It's identified by its enclosed mosaic. So I need to go through the objects in the input, find one with a mosaic inside, and assign it a color based on the top-left key color in the mosaic.\n\nThe \"other\" objects are sorted by their area. Smallest -> Bottom-Left. Middle -> Top-Right. Largest -> Bottom-Right. The final output is formed by tessellating these pieces. So, I must extract the 4 shapes and map them to keys, using the calculated area.\n\nThe tessellation part is about fitting the transformed shapes into the final square. Based on examples, I need to fit the new colors into corners of the grid. It's about combining colors and shapes together to form the new square. The examples tell me that the shapes will be translated, and potentially rotated to fit.\n\nFor the new shapes, I can visualize this as a mapping operation from the source shapes to a new set of shapes on the new grid. I then need to place them in the correct quadrant/corner based on their calculated areas and color assignments, from the key colors.\n\nSo, I need to:\n1.  Parse Input to extract all shapes and colors.\n2.  Find the mosaic container. Get the keys. Merge this shape.\n3.  Calculate Areas. Sort Shapes by Area. Assign Quadrants.\n4.  Generate Output Grid by filling the quadrants with the final shapes.\n\nBased on the prompt's hint \"TL piece at top-left, TR piece at top-right...\", that suggests a fixed top-left placement. The shapes might have to be rotated.\nI'm ready to apply this to the new test input. Let's start with parsing the shapes and object area calculations.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the input and the transformation rules derived from the examples:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects & Keys**:\n    *   **Object A**: The large maroon container (color 9) with inclusions (3, 6, 4, 8).\n        *   Mosaic colors: TL=3 (Green), TR=6 (Magenta), BL=4 (Yellow), BR=8 (Teal).\n        *   Container A merges with inclusions and takes the **TL Key (3, Green)**.\n        *   Area of A: ~52 pixels.\n    *   **Object B**: The large grey object (color 5). Area ~62 pixels.\n        *   Largest of the other three -> **BR Key (8, Teal)**.\n    *   **Object D**: The red object (color 2). Area 18 pixels.\n        *   Middle sized -> **TR Key (6, Magenta)**.\n    *   **Object C**: The orange object (color 7). Area 12 pixels.\n        *   Smallest -> **BL Key (4, Yellow)**.\n\n2.  **Determine Output Size**:\n    *   Total Area = 52 + 62 + 18 + 12 = 144 pixels.\n    *   Output Grid is $\\sqrt{144} \\times \\sqrt{144} = 12 \\times 12$.\n\n3.  **Tessellation**:\n    *   **TL (Green, 3)**: Corresponds to Object A. It is placed in the top-left. Its shape (width 10, height 8 with gaps) anchors the tessellation.\n    *   **TR (Magenta, 6)**: Corresponds to Object D. It fills the top-right corner and the voids left by A's shape.\n    *   **BR (Teal, 8)**: Corresponds to Object B. It is a large, complex piece that interlocks with A and fills the bottom-right.\n    *   **BL (Yellow, 4)**: Corresponds to Object C. It fills the remaining space in the bottom-left.\n\n    *Reconstructed Layout*:\n    *   Rows 0-1: Green (10 wide), Magenta (2 wide).\n    *   Rows 2-3: Green (4 wide), Magenta (4 wide, filling A's gap), Green (2 wide), Magenta (2 wide).\n    *   Rows 4-7: Complex interlocking of Green and Magenta/Teal.\n    *   Rows 8-11: Teal (dominant in BR) and Yellow (dominant in BL).\n\n    Based on the standard ARC constraints where shapes tessellate cleanly to form the final square, the resulting grid is constructed below.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

Objects: Monochromatic regions, Containers with inclusions, Mosaic sections.\nAttributes: Color, Connectivity, Enclosing/Enclosed relationship, Tessellation.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1) Find the unique container object that encloses a 2x2 mosaic of 4 distinct colors; read key colors as (TL,TR,BL,BR). 2) Merge container and its inclusions into one piece and recolor all its pixels to key TL. 3) For the other 3 objects, sort by pixel area: smallest\u2192key BL, middle\u2192key TR, largest\u2192key BR (recolor each object uniformly). 4) Let N\u00b2 = total count of all non-0 input pixels; output is an N\u00d7N square with no 0. 5) Keep each object\u2019s exact shape but allow rotations by 0/90/180/270 and translate them to tessellate the square: TL piece at top-left, TR piece at top-right, BL piece at bottom-left, BR piece at bottom-right.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n\n1. **Find the container with 2\u00d72 mosaic**: In the test input, the color 9 region (rows 4-11, cols 3-12) contains a 2\u00d72 mosaic at positions (5,4)-(6,5):\n   - TL=3, TR=6, BL=4, BR=8\n\n2. **Identify other objects and count pixels**:\n   - Container (color 9 + interior): 52 pixels \u2192 becomes color 3\n   - Color 5 shape: 62 pixels (largest) \u2192 becomes BR color 8\n   - Color 2 shape: 18 pixels (middle) \u2192 becomes TR color 6  \n   - Color 7 shape: 12 pixels (smallest) \u2192 becomes BL color 4\n\n3. **Calculate output size**: Total pixels = 52+62+18+12 = 144 = 12\u00b2, so output is 12\u00d712\n\n4. **Tessellation**: The container shape defines the TL region:\n   - Rows 0-1: 10 columns (cols 0-9)\n   - Rows 2-3: cols 0-3 and 8-9 (6 pixels each)\n   - Row 4: cols 0-1 and 8-9; Row 5: cols 0-1\n   - Rows 6-7: cols 0-6 (7 each)\n\nThe gaps within the container shape get filled by BR (color 8), TR fills the right edge, and BL fills the bottom-left corner. The shapes tessellate to completely fill the 12\u00d712 grid.\n\n**Verification of pixel counts**:\n- Color 3 (TL): 10+10+6+6+4+2+7+7 = 52 \u2713\n- Color 6 (TR): 2\u00d79 = 18 \u2713\n- Color 4 (BL): 3\u00d74 = 12 \u2713\n- Color 8 (BR): 4+4+6+8+3+3+7+9+9+9 = 62 \u2713\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

Objects: Monochromatic regions, Containers with inclusions, Mosaic sections.\nAttributes: Color, Connectivity, Enclosing/Enclosed relationship, Tessellation.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1) Find the unique container object that encloses a 2x2 mosaic of 4 distinct colors; read key colors as (TL,TR,BL,BR). 2) Merge container and its inclusions into one piece and recolor all its pixels to key TL. 3) For the other 3 objects, sort by pixel area: smallest\u2192key BL, middle\u2192key TR, largest\u2192key BR (recolor each object uniformly). 4) Let N\u00b2 = total count of all non-0 input pixels; output is an N\u00d7N square with no 0. 5) Keep each object\u2019s exact shape but allow rotations by 0/90/180/270 and translate them to tessellate the square: TL piece at top-left, TR piece at top-right, BL piece at bottom-left, BR piece at bottom-right.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n\n1. **Find the container with 2\u00d72 mosaic**: In the test input, color 9 contains a 2\u00d72 mosaic at rows 5-6, cols 4-5 with colors (TL=3, TR=6, BL=4, BR=8).\n\n2. **Count pixels for each object**:\n   - Container (color 9 + mosaic): 52 pixels\n   - Color 5 object: 62 pixels (largest of remaining)\n   - Color 2 object: 18 pixels (middle)\n   - Color 7 object: 12 pixels (smallest)\n\n3. **Assign key colors**:\n   - Container \u2192 TL color (3)\n   - Smallest (color 7, 12px) \u2192 BL color (4)\n   - Middle (color 2, 18px) \u2192 TR color (6)\n   - Largest (color 5, 62px) \u2192 BR color (8)\n\n4. **Calculate output size**: Total pixels = 52+62+18+12 = 144 = 12\u00b2, so output is 12\u00d712.\n\n5. **Tessellate the shapes**: The container shape has internal gaps that need to be filled by other shapes. Analyzing the container's structure:\n   - Rows 0-1: full width (cols 0-9)\n   - Rows 2-3: cols 0-3 and 8-9 filled, gap at cols 4-7\n   - Row 4: cols 0-1 and 8-9 filled, gap at cols 2-7\n   - Row 5: cols 0-1 filled only\n   - Rows 6-7: cols 0-6 filled\n\nThe BR shape (color 8, 62 pixels) fills the container's internal gaps and extends below. TR (color 6, 18 pixels) fills the right side. BL (color 4, 12 pixels) fills the bottom-left corner after being rotated.\n\nAfter working out the tessellation to ensure all shapes fit perfectly:\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

Objects: Monochromatic regions, Containers with inclusions, Mosaic sections.\nAttributes: Color, Connectivity, Enclosing/Enclosed relationship, Tessellation.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1) Find the unique container object that encloses a 2x2 mosaic of 4 distinct colors; read key colors as (TL,TR,BL,BR). 2) Merge container and its inclusions into one piece and recolor all its pixels to key TL. 3) For the other 3 objects, sort by pixel area: smallest\u2192key BL, middle\u2192key TR, largest\u2192key BR (recolor each object uniformly). 4) Let N\u00b2 = total count of all non-0 input pixels; output is an N\u00d7N square with no 0. 5) Keep each object\u2019s exact shape but allow rotations by 0/90/180/270 and translate them to tessellate the square: TL piece at top-left, TR piece at top-right, BL piece at bottom-left, BR piece at bottom-right.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n\n1. **Find the container with 2x2 mosaic**: In the test input, I can see color 9 forms a container with a 2x2 mosaic at rows 5-6, cols 4-5:\n   - TL = 3 (green), TR = 6 (magenta)\n   - BL = 4 (yellow), BR = 8 (azure)\n\n2. **Count pixels for each object**:\n   - Container (color 9 + mosaic): 52 pixels \u2192 recolor to TL = 3\n   - Color 5 region: 62 pixels (largest) \u2192 recolor to BR = 8\n   - Color 2 region: 18 pixels (middle) \u2192 recolor to TR = 6\n   - Color 7 region: 12 pixels (smallest) \u2192 recolor to BL = 4\n   - Total: 52 + 62 + 18 + 12 = 144 = 12\u00b2, so N = 12\n\n3. **Identify shapes**:\n   - Container has a complex shape with internal holes\n   - Object 5 (BR) is the largest with complex shape\n   - Object 2 (TR) has a triangular staircase pattern\n   - Object 7 (BL) has an L-shaped pattern\n\n4. **Tessellate**: Following the example patterns, I rotate the container 90\u00b0 clockwise and position each piece:\n   - TL (color 3) at top-left spanning cols 0-7\n   - TR (color 6) at top-right forming a triangular wedge\n   - BL (color 4) at bottom-left\n   - BR (color 8) fills the remaining space including internal gaps\n\nAfter careful construction ensuring each piece maintains its pixel count:\n- Color 3: 52 pixels \u2713\n- Color 6: 18 pixels \u2713\n- Color 4: 12 pixels \u2713\n- Color 8: 62 pixels \u2713\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,8,8\n3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

Objects: Monochromatic regions, Containers with inclusions, Mosaic sections.\nAttributes: Color, Connectivity, Enclosing/Enclosed relationship, Tessellation.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1) Find the unique container object that encloses a 2x2 mosaic of 4 distinct colors; read key colors as (TL,TR,BL,BR). 2) Merge container and its inclusions into one piece and recolor all its pixels to key TL. 3) For the other 3 objects, sort by pixel area: smallest\u2192key BL, middle\u2192key TR, largest\u2192key BR (recolor each object uniformly). 4) Let N\u00b2 = total count of all non-0 input pixels; output is an N\u00d7N square with no 0. 5) Keep each object\u2019s exact shape but allow rotations by 0/90/180/270 and translate them to tessellate the square: TL piece at top-left, TR piece at top-right, BL piece at bottom-left, BR piece at bottom-right.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n\n1. **Find the container with 2x2 mosaic**: In the test input, the 9s region (rows 4-11) contains a 2x2 mosaic at positions (5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5) with colors 3,6,4,8. So TL=3, TR=6, BL=4, BR=8.\n\n2. **Identify and count pixels for other objects**:\n   - Container (9s + mosaic): 52 pixels\n   - 7s (rows 19-24): 12 pixels (smallest)\n   - 2s (rows 20-23): 18 pixels (middle)\n   - 5s (rows 6-17): 62 pixels (largest)\n\n3. **Assign colors based on size**:\n   - Container \u2192 TL color (3): 52 pixels\n   - Smallest (7s) \u2192 BL color (4): 12 pixels\n   - Middle (2s) \u2192 TR color (6): 18 pixels\n   - Largest (5s) \u2192 BR color (8): 62 pixels\n\n4. **Calculate output size**: 52+12+18+62 = 144 = 12\u00b2, so output is 12\u00d712.\n\n5. **Tessellate the shapes**:\n   - Container (90\u00b0 CW rotation) placed at origin, spanning rows 0-9 with pattern including gaps\n   - TR piece (90\u00b0 CW rotation) fills top-right corner, rows 0-5, cols 8-11 (staircase pattern)\n   - BL piece (90\u00b0 CCW rotation) fills bottom-left corner, rows 9-11\n   - BR piece fills remaining 62 cells\n\nConstructing the tessellation with proper rotations:\n- Container (3): occupies top-left area with internal gaps\n- TR (6): occupies top-right staircase\n- BL (4): occupies bottom-left corner\n- BR (8): fills all remaining space\n\nVerifying counts: 3s=52\u2713, 4s=12\u2713, 6s=18\u2713, 8s=62\u2713\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,6\n3,3,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

                "response": "**Analysis of Object Types in Grids**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My task is to describe the *types* of objects in these grids, focusing on their attributes. No rules, just a catalog. Here's what I've got:\n\nFirst, I see that some grids have a background, indicated by the value 0. That's a clear starting point. Then, looking at the grids, there are different *kinds* of regions within the grid. I'm going to start with three core visual categories based on how the pixels are arranged, considering some grids have no background.\n\n**The object types I observe are:**\n\n1.  **Background:** The most common color 0.\n2.  **Monochromatic Shapes:** Areas of contiguous pixels, all the same color, forming blocks, irregular blobs, or other connected shapes. Think of colors 7, 3, 5, 2, 9, and 1.\n3.  **Container Shapes with Inclusions:** These are also contiguous regions of a single color, but they're special. They enclose individual, different-colored pixels *inside* them. Some colors acting as containers are 2, 9, and 6.\n4.  **Inclusions/Markers:** Those individual pixels of different colors (like 1, 5, 8, 9, 3, 6, 4, 2) that are *inside* the container shapes.\n5.  **Tessellated/Mosaic Regions:** In some grids, there's no background color. Instead, the whole grid is filled with large, neighboring regions of different colors (1, 5, 9, 8, 2, 4, 3) that fit together like a mosaic, without a clear background.\n\nEssentially, I need to focus on these concepts of *background*, *monochromatic contiguous blobs*, *container shapes with inclusions*, and *tessellated regions that completely fill the grid*.\n\nMy main attributes I have to discuss are:  *Color value (0-9)*,  *spatial positioning*,  *the connectivity of the pixels* (whether they are next to each other or connected), *if they enclose/are enclosed in*, and *whether they form a tessellation*.\n\nLet's output that:\n\n```\n<objects_summary>\nBackground: Color 0. Objects: Monochromatic regions, Containers with inclusions, Mosaic sections.\nAttributes: Color, Connectivity, Enclosing/Enclosed relationship, Tessellation.\n</objects_summary>\n```\n\n\nBased on the provided grids, the objects can be categorized into several distinct types based on their composition, background relationship, and internal structure.\n\n**1. Background Field**\n*   In the majority of the grids, color 0 acts as a background canvas. It fills the space not occupied by other distinct objects.\n*   The background separates independent objects from one another.\n\n**2. Monochromatic Contiguous Shapes**\n*   These are solid objects composed of a single color value (other than 0).\n*   They vary in shape from rectangular blocks (e.g., color 7, color 1) to irregular blobs or L-shapes (e.g., color 3, color 5, color 2).\n*   These objects are homogeneous; every pixel within the object boundary has the same color value.\n\n**3. \"Container\" Objects with Internal Markers**\n*   These are contiguous shapes, typically of colors 2, 6, or 9, which enclose other distinct pixels.\n*   The main body of the object is a single color, but it surrounds or borders specific isolated pixels of different colors.\n*   For example, a shape of color 2 contains individual pixels of colors 1, 5, 8, and 9. A shape of color 9 contains pixels of colors 3, 6, 4, and 8. A shape of color 6 contains pixels of 2, 4, 8, and 3.\n*   These \"container\" shapes are generally irregular and define a boundary around the internal pixels.\n\n**4. Internal \"Marker\" Pixels**\n*   These are single, isolated pixels found strictly within the boundaries of the \"Container\" objects described above.\n*   They have distinct color values from the surrounding container material.\n*   They appear as 1x1 points rather than larger connected regions.\n\n**5. Tessellating Mosaic Regions**\n*   In specific grids (where color 0 is absent), the objects are large, solid regions of colors (such as 1, 5, 8, 9, 2, 3, 4) that fit together like a puzzle.\n*   These objects share borders directly with one another without a separating background.\n*   They completely fill the grid dimensions.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Color 0 field separating other objects.\n2. Solid Objects: Homogeneous, contiguous shapes of single colors (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7) ranging from rectangles to irregular forms.\n3. Container Objects: Contiguous shapes (colors 2, 6, 9) that enclose distinct, single-pixel markers.\n4. Internal Markers: Isolated single pixels (various colors) embedded within Container Objects.\n5. Mosaic Regions: Large, tessellating color blocks (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9) appearing in grids without a background.\n</objects_summary>",

Objects: Monochromatic regions, Containers with inclusions, Mosaic sections.\nAttributes: Color, Connectivity, Enclosing/Enclosed relationship, Tessellation.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1) Find the unique container object that encloses a 2x2 mosaic of 4 distinct colors; read key colors as (TL,TR,BL,BR). 2) Merge container and its inclusions into one piece and recolor all its pixels to key TL. 3) For the other 3 objects, sort by pixel area: smallest\u2192key BL, middle\u2192key TR, largest\u2192key BR (recolor each object uniformly). 4) Let N\u00b2 = total count of all non-0 input pixels; output is an N\u00d7N square with no 0. 5) Keep each object\u2019s exact shape but allow rotations by 0/90/180/270 and translate them to tessellate the square: TL piece at top-left, TR piece at top-right, BL piece at bottom-left, BR piece at bottom-right.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
