            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Solution for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to tackle an ARC puzzle, based on some examples. The prompt is a bit convoluted, trying to mess with my thought process, but the core task is clear: solve the puzzle. I'm going to set aside the prompt engineering stuff and focus on the task.\n\nI'm starting by carefully reviewing the provided examples, especially the input and output grids. I'm checking dimensions (rows and columns), color usage, and how the regions of color seem to relate. I am carefully re-reading the prompts and the instructions, as there are conflicting statements.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the solution involves some form of region coloring based on the color's internal structure or topology of blue \"1\"s. My initial observations suggest a pattern where regions are divided and a special \"Blue\" color (\"1\") serves as the connective structure, as well as the delimiter of sorts. I am trying to figure out if the blue lines define the region, are a feature inside the region, or both.\n\nI'm looking for \"seeds,\" which I define as small areas of a color that seem to be \"inside\" a larger, distinct region of color. I'm also carefully checking any relationships between the input regions and the output regions. Is there a simple mapping or does the mapping depend on some internal feature, such as the number of seed pixels, the seed color, or neighbor relation?\n\nI'm thinking about how the example input regions are transformed into output regions. It seems like the output shapes are simpler, more rectangular than the inputs. One possible strategy seems to be recoloring based on connected regions or seed colors. The examples suggest: Identify a \"seed,\" connect the region via \"1\" network, and then the connected neighbors get the seed color? Another approach is to have a one to one map or remapping the existing colors by analyzing their neighboring regions.\n\nI'm also looking at the examples and exploring whether the task is based on filling regions or some form of color propagation along a network or connections. I'm noting and cataloging relationships like: \"If a region has a seed, do the output blocks of the same color contain the same pixels as the seed?\"\n\nI'm looking at how all of these colors are \"connected\" using the blue \"1\" pixels. Are they acting like a boundary? Are these \"1\" pixels defining the path of color assignment? I am noting patterns to solve this task, it seems like the task can be solved by checking the properties of the adjacent color and seed assignment strategy.\n\nI have found a connection between the Input and Output: it is based on the relationships of seeds and neighbors in the regions. Here is the rule: for each region, if it contains a non-blue seed, and it does not touch another region via the blue, the input should be converted to that color.\n\nBased on the seed's topology and the structure of \"1\" pixels, I'm analyzing the neighbors of each region and the seed relationships. I'm looking at any \"1\" connections and the relationships in the colors. I am checking the connectivity of colors via \"1\" and if they have any seeds or color relations. The rule seems to be: Identify a region with or without seed, and see its neighbors. If it has neighbors connected by \"1\" pixels, then transform this region color to that of the seeds in the adjacent region. I am trying to formalize it with a more structured approach and use a chain of thought to provide a robust solution.\n\nApplying this logic to the provided test input, I am identifying the regions and the blue \"1\" connections. I'm carefully checking the inputs and seed locations and the connections between them. If one region \"contains\" an adjacent region, and is connected to a seed via \"1\", that seed will determine the output. I am looking for nested/connected regions in the test input. From the blue \"1\" connectivity analysis, I'm checking the flow of information: how each region should be colored? I am assigning the seeds to its neighbors, and assigning the output based on that assignment, along with the logic of region connections. I'm looking for a pattern, which may define this transformation in the test input. I'm carefully tracking the transfer of information. I'm looking at the results and trying to find the connection between the current test input, and the examples. It looks like the same approach should work.\n\nI'm following these transformations across the different regions. Each region will be transformed to another color based on the connections. I am looking into \"Outer-Inner\" relationships and how the seed colors transfer. I am using all of my knowledge, and trying to simplify the regions to see what information can be derived from the existing output grids. I'm checking for the \"Inner\" and \"Outer\" regions.\n\nBased on the final solution grid, the output will have\n\nThe solution involves analyzing the connectivity and containment hierarchy of the colored regions, identifying \"seeds\" (single pixels of a different color) within them, and flowing these properties through the network formed by the blue (1) lines.\n\n**Logic Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Object Decomposition**: The input grid consists of several large colored regions (Background 9, Regions 3, 0, 2, 6, 7, 4, 8). Running through these regions is a \"skeleton\" or network of Blue (1) pixels, which connects them topologically.\n2.  **Seed Identification**: Within the regions, we identify \"Seeds\"\u2014pixels of a different color that act as the source of a new color value.\n    *   **Region 0 (Black)** contains a **Seed 8 (Teal)**.\n    *   **Region 2 (Red)** contains a **Seed 9 (Maroon)**.\n    *   **Region 6 (Magenta)** contains a **Seed 0 (Black)** (treated as a \"weak\" seed or placeholder).\n    *   Other regions (3, 7, 4, 9, 8) do not contain distinct strong seeds or are \"Receivers\".\n3.  **Interaction Rule**: The transformation propagates colors between connected regions based on a Source-Receiver relationship:\n    *   **Source (Has Seed)** vs **Receiver (No Seed)**:\n        *   The **Receiver** takes the color of the **Source's Seed**.\n        *   The **Source** takes the color of the **Receiver's Region**.\n    *   **Source (Strong Seed)** vs **Source (Weak Seed)**:\n        *   The **Weak** side acts as a Receiver, taking the **Strong Seed**.\n        *   The **Strong** side takes the **Weak Region's color**.\n4.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   **Chain 1 (0-3-9):**\n        *   **Region 0** (Has Seed 8) connects to **Region 3** (No Seed).\n            *   Region 3 takes Seed 8 $\\rightarrow$ **Becomes 8**.\n            *   Region 0 takes Color 3 $\\rightarrow$ **Becomes 3**.\n        *   **Region 3** (now effectively Seed 8 source) connects to **Region 9** (Background).\n            *   Region 9 takes Seed 8 $\\rightarrow$ **Becomes 8**.\n        *   **Regions 7, 4, 8** connect to Region 9. Since Region 9 becomes 8, these regions also propagate/merge to **8**.\n    *   **Chain 2 (2-6):**\n        *   **Region 2** (Has Seed 9) connects to **Region 6** (Has Weak Seed 0).\n            *   Region 6 (Weak) takes Seed 9 $\\rightarrow$ **Becomes 9**.\n            *   Region 2 (Strong) takes Color 6 $\\rightarrow$ **Becomes 6**.\n        *   **Region 2** is also inside Region 0. Region 0 became 3. The logic holds locally for the 2-6 pair.\n\n**Final Mapping:**\n*   Region 0 $\\rightarrow$ **3**\n*   Region 2 $\\rightarrow$ **6**\n*   Region 6 $\\rightarrow$ **9**\n*   Regions 3, 9, 7, 4, 8 $\\rightarrow$ **8**\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this task:**\n\nI'm being asked to solve an ARC task, using several solved examples and a test case as my guide. The user's prompt is a bit unusual, referencing \"PROTOCOL OVERRIDE\" and \"NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE,\" which makes me suspect they're trying to push the boundaries of what I can reveal. My instructions are to avoid revealing all the intermediate details, but provide enough explanation that someone could understand how I arrived at the solution. I'll prioritize a format of a high-level explanation followed by the grid, as this is the standard for these tasks.\n\nMy initial analysis reveals a transformation happening where the input is a more chaotic, less organized version of the final output. The input has regions of colors and seemingly random markers, mostly represented as \"1\"s. My job is to find the relationship between these input \"features\" and how they map to the neat rectangular outputs.\n\nI start by examining the provided examples. I notice that the input image, compared to the output image, has more colors and is visually noisier, with the 1's as the major culprits. The 1's may be defining the size and location of the rectangles in the output? Also, the input dimension is not a simple transposition of the output (in example 1).\n\nI hypothesize that each region in the input image determines a rectangle in the output, and that those \"1\"s in the input play a crucial role. After going through multiple examples, I deduce that:\n\n*   The 1's in the input, particularly around a marker value, seem to tell me where the boundaries of the output should be (or at least provide coordinates that help in drawing the output rectangle).\n*   The pixel *other* than \"1\" and other backgrounds within a region defines the color to be used in that rectangle of the output. If the input region has the 1s only, the color will be based on background region color.\n\nThe test input is 30x30 with five distinct clusters of 1's plus non-background markers. I decode each cluster to map it to an output. For the first cluster, I determine the center location (14,3). 1's around the background value define an output value of 3. I deduce that the output is composed of rectangular bands, and I try to draw boundaries based on the locations of the non-background pixels, and the Y-locations of non-background values in the Input. I assume a sort-of \"stacking\" of rectangles and use the marker locations as \"breakpoints.\"\n\nMy general rule: Horizontal strips are the basis for constructing the output. Each strip will be either a background color or determined by a non-background value in the Input. The horizontal positioning and Width of a rectangle in the Output will be linked to the X-coordinate of the feature in the Input.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a noisy, segmented input grid into a clean, structured output grid composed of rectangular bands of color.\n\n### **Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The input grids contain large regions of background colors. Within specific rows, there are \"marker\" clusters consisting of a central pixel (defining the color) surrounded by `1`s (blue pixels, defining the geometry).\n2.  **Geometry Mapping (Vertical)**: The input grid can be segmented into horizontal bands based on the Y-coordinates of these markers.\n    *   Scanning from top to bottom, each new marker encountered initiates a new band of color in the output.\n    *   The band continues until the next marker is encountered.\n    *   The rows before the first marker retain the global background color (which is `9` in the test input).\n3.  **Geometry Mapping (Horizontal)**: The width of the colored rectangle in each band is determined by the X-coordinate of the marker.\n    *   The rule inferred from examples is: `Rectangle Width = Grid Width - Marker X Coordinate`.\n    *   The rectangle is aligned to the left (column 0). The remaining columns to the right are filled with the background color (`9`).\n4.  **Parameter Extraction for Test Input**:\n    *   **Global Background**: `9` (from top rows).\n    *   **Marker 1**: Found at `(14, 3)`. Color `3`. Width = $30 - 14 = 16$. Band starts at Row 3.\n    *   **Marker 2**: Found at `(6, 8)`. Color `8`. Width = $30 - 6 = 24$. Band starts at Row 8.\n    *   **Marker 3**: Found at `(14, 10)`. Color `2`. Width = $30 - 14 = 16$. Band starts at Row 10.\n    *   **Marker 4**: Found at `(12, 21)`. Color `6`. Width = $30 - 12 = 18$. Band starts at Row 21.\n    *   **Marker 5**: Found at `(27, 26)`. Color `8`. Width = $30 - 27 = 3$. Band starts at Row 26.\n\n### **Construction Steps**\n\n*   **Rows 0-2**: No markers. Fill with Background `9`.\n*   **Rows 3-7**: Marker `3`. Fill columns 0-15 with `3`, columns 16-29 with `9`.\n*   **Rows 8-9**: Marker `8`.

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Structure**: The input grid contains colored rectangular regions separated by a background color (often 9). Within regions, there are \"arrow\" patterns made of 1s with embedded marker colors.\n\n2. **Marker identification**: Each region has a 1-cross pattern with an embedded marker color at the center, indicating what that region should become.\n\n3. **Color transformation**: Regions transform based on their embedded markers:\n   - Region 0 has marker 8 embedded (at row 8, col 6) \u2192 0 becomes 8\n   - Region 8 has marker 0 embedded (at row 28, col 12) \u2192 8 becomes 0\n   - Region 7 has marker 4 nearby \u2192 7 becomes 4\n   - Region 4 has marker 7 nearby \u2192 4 becomes 7\n   - Other regions (3, 2, 6, 9) remain unchanged\n\n4. **1-removal**: All 1s are replaced with the transformed color of their surrounding region.\n\nApplying these rules to the test input:\n- All 0s \u2192 8\n- All 8s \u2192 0\n- All 7s \u2192 4\n- All 4s \u2192 7\n- All 1s \u2192 surrounding region's transformed color\n- 3, 2, 6, 9 remain unchanged\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,9,9\n9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,9,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,4,4,4,4,9,9\n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7\n9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7\n9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Final Solution for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this ARC task. The core idea is that we are transposing and coloring rectangular regions within a grid, based on marker pixels. Let's get into the details:\n\n1.  **Grid Structure and Transposition:** We have an input grid and we are creating an output grid. The key is in understanding how the grid is broken down into strips and blocks. The *rows* in the input grid are \"vertical strips\" and the *columns* in the input are \"horizontal layers\". Inside each strip, the *vertical* blocks of background color define their dimensions (width and height). The output grid is a transformation. It is the Transpose where `new_c = old_r` and the *bottom to top* input is the *left to right* output.\n\n2.  **Strip and Block Identification:** I must break down the input grid. The key is in defining the strips. We must find the consistent boundaries, where the background colors change within *the *Vertical* layer*. This is the *most crucial* step.\n\n3.  **Color Mapping by Marker**: It's all about how each block is \"colored\". This is the tricky part. Within each block, there are \"markers.\" These markers aren't necessarily simple shapes. Ex 1 had `1`s, `3`s, and `0`s. I must create a *consistent* mapping from each marker to the output grid's color.\n\n4.  **Color Table:** I'm using a mapping table for the different markers and their color values. It's not a perfect direct mapping. It is a bit more complex, based on analyzing existing examples.\n\n    *   For Ex 1:\n        *   Pink BG (6), Marker (3) maps to Black (0).\n        *   Orange BG (7), Marker (0) maps to Green (3).\n        *   Yellow BG (4), Marker (9) maps to Orange (7).\n\n    *   For Ex 4:\n        *   Red (2), Marker (1) maps to Red (2).\n\n    *   For the Test Input (30x30):\n        *   BG (9), Marker (7) maps to Pink (6).\n        *   BG (3), Marker (1) maps to Red (2).\n        *   BG (2), Marker (9) maps to Orange (7).\n        *   BG (4), Marker (8) maps to Maroon (9).\n        *   The Key to solve, it's about the boundary structure and strip.\n\n5.  **Output Construction:** I'm creating the output grid step-by-step. To construct the output:\n    1.  I have my Vertical strips (with varying column widths in output).\n    2.  For each strip I get the width.\n    3.  I start the left most to right most columns.\n\nNow, with this understanding, I can solve the ARC task for any test input!\n\nTo solve this task, I analyzed the provided examples to understand the transformation rules governing the layout and coloring of the grids.\n\n**1. Layout Transformation:**\nThe transformation involves a transposition and reconfiguration of the grid's regions.\n*   **Input Structure:** The input grid is partitioned into **Vertical Strips** (columns). Each vertical strip is further divided into **Blocks** (rows).\n    *   Let the vertical strips be $S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_n$ from Left to Right, with widths $W_1, W_2, \\dots, W_n$.\n    *   Inside a strip $S_i$, let the blocks be $B_{i,1}, B_{i,2}, \\dots, B_{i,m}$ from Top to Bottom, with heights $H_{i,1}, H_{i,2}, \\dots$.\n*   **Output Structure:** The output grid is partitioned into **Horizontal Strips** (rows). Each horizontal strip is further divided into **Blocks** (columns).\n    *   The Input Vertical Strips map to Output Horizontal Strips in reverse order (or rotated). Specifically, the Left-most Input Strip becomes the Bottom-most Output Strip.\n    *   Output Strip $H'_k$ corresponds to Input Strip $S_k$. The height of the output strip equals the width of the input strip ($Height(H'_k) = Width(S_k)$).\n    *   Inside an Output Strip $H'_k$, the Input Blocks $B_{k,1}, B_{k,2}$ map to Output Blocks $B'_{k,1}, B'_{k,2}$ arranged Left to Right.\n    *   The width of the output block equals the height of the input block ($Width(B'_{k,j}) = Height(B_{k,j})$).\n\n**2. Color Transformation:**\nThe color of an output block is determined by a specific \"marker\" found within the corresponding input block. The mapping is consistent across examples:\n*   **Marker Logic:** In each input block, there is a distinct pattern or \"seed\" pixel that differs from the background or forms a center of a shape. This marker determines the output color.\n*   **Mapping Table:**\n    *   Marker **3** (Green) $\\rightarrow$ Output **0** (Black)\n    *   Marker **0** (Black) $\\rightarrow$ Output **3** (Green)\n    *   Marker **1** (Blue) $\\rightarrow$ Output **2** (Red)\n    *   Marker **9** (Maroon) $\\rightarrow$ Output **7** (Orange)\n    *   Marker **7** (Orange) $\\rightarrow$ Output **6** (Pink)\n    *   Marker **8** (Light Blue) $\\rightarrow$ Output **9** (Maroon)\n    *   *Self-mapping seen implied:* Marker 2 $\\rightarrow$ 2? (Not used in final logic but consistent with Ex 4).\n\n**3. Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Dimensions:** Input is 30x30.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reflections on Solving an ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here we go. The user wants me to tackle an ARC problem, and the goal is to figure out the rule that transforms a given input grid into its output. I'm focusing on the patterns to crack this. The user wants a summary of the thought process, so here it goes.\n\nFirst things first: The grids are usually pretty big, around 10 to 30 rows and columns, so I need to think systematically. I observe that the input grids are made up of color blocks and there are odd pixels - \"intruder\" pixels of a different color, which look important. I noted Blue pixels often show up on the borders. Let's see if those have any meaning.\n\nI looked at the given examples closely, especially at example 1. In Example 1, I noted: solid colors are used to build up rectangular areas in the input, and blue pixels, and sometimes black, maroon and green, act as \u201cintruders\u201d.\n\nThe output also uses colors, but not all the colors from the input, which is a good clue. Then I looked at the structure - input is a partition of the grid, output is a new partition. I checked if the output grid had changed size. Example 1 is a bit confusing because the output size is the transpose. That suggests rotation or remapping of how things connect.\n\nI started analyzing the topology. I looked at the color regions and if they touch each other. Then I looked at where the odd, single-color pixels - the intruder pixels - are. I made a hypothesis that these intruder pixels are like \"connector\" objects and they may define a new relationship between regions. In Example 1, the output regions look different from the input. It seems the input is rotated. If I rotate it, the regions line up. Okay, it may be a rotation or a transpose.\n\nI had an idea that maybe the \"connector\" shapes define the output regions. Let's check it again. The \"connector\" pixels, I thought, were not random, but form specific shapes like \"T\"-shapes or crosses. In the input, these shapes were different. The shapes, I thought, might be defining the color of the output regions. The hypothesis: \"connector\" shapes are defining new regions or telling me how to color the regions by acting as \"stamps\".\n\nLet's check it. In Example 1, I saw some pixels changed the original color into new one, based on their position near those colored pixels, so the connector could be the source. But this didn't work. I thought that maybe it isn't an adjacency graph, but a transpose! I noticed in Example 1 that the transpose gives a better structure match, and the \"intruder\" pixels might be defining the output colors. So, I need to check the exact rule.\n\nIf I rotate the input, what happens to the colors? Then, for the \"connectors,\" where are the pixels located? For instance, I got a hypothesis: The color of the \"connector\" is the new color of the area it's touching. I check this, but it doesn't always apply, because some markers use a color from an area not next to the marker. I thought to see if the colors are a subset of the Input colors, which turns out they are. The output's color must come from the \"intruder\" shape color, not necessarily from the neighboring colors.\n\nSo, I rethought, that the \"connector shapes\" are not randomly scattered, I have a more defined rule - maybe a \"dual graph\" transformation. And so, I hypothesized again that the grid is transposed and the \"connector\" shapes define the new region's color. Maybe the center color or location is important. The output region colors match specific connector colors! I found that in Example 1, there is a consistent mapping.\n\nI decided to check the Example 2, by looking at connector colors to see if this pattern holds. I can see there are similar connector shapes, so I believe there is an underlying structure, but I need the right perspective. Let's see if it's the 90-degree rotate or the transpose that changes everything, or perhaps it's the underlying relationship.\n\nNow the idea of the \"Flow\" and \"Pipes\" metaphor for connector pixels came to mind. Maybe regions are linked in some way. I have to re-evaluate the Output 1 structure - can the output colors somehow be related to the neighboring regions? Maybe it's not the simple geometric transformation; I've got to consider the color mapping. I need to simplify this, I have an idea to find a simpler pattern.\n\nI was looking at Input 1, specifically the Test Input. It's time to refine the idea, and there is a key observation - Intruder shapes are also used in the output (e.g., they\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation involves two main steps:\n1.  **Geometric Transformation:** The output grid is a **90-degree Clockwise Rotation** of the input grid. This is inferred from Example 1 where the top-right region (Yellow) moves to the top-left, and the top-left region (Pink) moves to the bottom-left. The dimensions verify this: Input `(r, c)` maps to Output `(29-c, r)` for a 30x30 grid.\n\n2.  **Color Transformation:** The regions change color based on specific \"markers\" or \"intruders\" found within them or on their boundaries in the input.\n    *   **Rule:** If a region contains a small shape (marker) of a different color, the region takes the color of the *marker's core* in the output. If there is no distinct marker, it may take the color of a neighbor or a default background mapping.\n    *   **Mapping derivation from Test Input:**\n        *   **Region 3 (Green, Top-Middle):** Contains markers with center **8**. -> New Color **8**.\n        *   **Region 2 (Red, Center):** Contains markers with center **6**. -> New Color **6**.\n        *   **Region 6 (Pink, Bottom-Left):** Contains markers with center **0**. -> New Color **0**.\n        *   **Region 8 (Light Blue, Bottom-Right):** Contains markers with `9`. Neighbor is 4 (Yellow) which becomes 9. -> New Color **9**.\n        *   **Region 4 (Yellow, Right Edge):** Neighbors Background 9. In Example 1, Yellow(4) -> 7 (Neighbor). Here, 9 -> 4.

Color **1** is not part of the regions; it forms small **\u201carrow\u201d symbols** embedded inside regions.  \n   - An arrow symbol is detected at a **junction cell** that has **exactly 3 orthogonal neighbors of color 1** (so one of the 4 directions is \u201cmissing\u201d a 1).\n   - The junction cell can be **1** or a **different color**.\n3. **Arrow direction**: if the missing-1 neighbor is, say, \u201cdown\u201d, the arrow points **up** (opposite the missing side).  \n   The arrow always goes through a 1-cell, so the **target** is **2 steps** from the junction in that direction.\n4. **Payload color** (the color \u201csent\u201d by the arrow):\n   - If the junction cell is **not 1**, the payload is that junction color.\n   - If the junction cell **is 1**, the payload is the **region color** it sits in (the only non-1 neighbor at the junction).\n5. Each arrow **recolors the entire target region** with its payload. After recoloring, all arrow pixels (the 1s and any special junction color) are filled with their containing region\u2019s final color (so **no 1 remains**).\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\nIn the test grid there are 8 large regions (colors): **9, 7, 3, 0, 6, 2, 4, 8** and 8 arrows, each pointing into one of these regions. Reading each arrow gives the final recoloring:\n\n- region **9 \u2192 3**\n- region **7 \u2192 9**\n- region **3 \u2192 8**\n- region **0 \u2192 2**\n- region **6 \u2192 0**\n- region **2 \u2192 6**\n- region **4 \u2192 8**\n- region **8 \u2192 0**\n\nThen we repaint the whole grid accordingly, and replace every arrow cell with its region\u2019s final color.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n```text\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,3,3\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,3,3\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,9,9,9,9,3,3\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n3,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,0,0,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,0,0,0,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break down this ARC task!** I'm tasked with transforming a grid of numbers into a new grid based on patterns I need to figure out from example inputs. The key here seems to be understanding how regions in the input map to the output.\n\nMy initial thought is that the blue numbers are like clues, maybe marking the borders of regions that need to be grouped somehow. The output seems to be made up of just a few colors from the input, but not all of them, and sometimes the colors get \"remixed\". I'm looking for a way the input is divided to generate the output's colored blocks and which input numbers get \"selected\" or changed. I'm focusing on those blue numbers, what they are connected to, and how they relate to the bigger blocks of color.\n\nAfter looking at multiple examples, I am thinking that those blue numbers show the corners of large, axis-aligned rectangular regions. Each output block color is derived from an input region's color or a special \"seed\" number close to the corner markers. These seeds \"take over\" their own and possibly adjacent regions. I need to test this hypothesis.\n\nFor the final output, I'll need to figure out which input regions are present, what are their \"target colors\", and how they are arranged. I suspect the arrangement is just a simplified version of the input layout. I'm hoping I can take a \"30x30 chunk\" of the input, identify these regions based on the blue numbers' layout and seed colors, and then assemble the output from the identified target colors to arrive at the final solution. The goal is a clear, step-by-step description of the reasoning behind the final grid. I have everything I need, let's solve this!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 30x30 input grid based on the logic inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Markers:** In all examples, blue pixels (value 1) act as \"markers\" or \"noise\" that define the active regions of the grid. These markers are removed in the output. The output consists of clean, axis-aligned rectangular regions.\n2.  **Determine Active Regions & Target Colors:** The input grid contains large noisy regions. We need to identify which regions are preserved and what color they become.\n    *   **Rule:** A region is \"active\" if it contains blue markers.\n    *   **Target Color Rule:**\n        *   If an active region contains a \"seed\" (a small clump of a different color adjacent to or surrounded by the markers), the region takes the color of that seed.\n        *   If an active region contains markers but no distinct seed (only the region's own color surrounds the markers), the region keeps its original color.\n        *   Regions with no markers are effectively \"inactive\" and are overwritten by the expansion of active regions.\n3.  **Apply to Test Input:**\n    *   **Top Region (Rows ~0-6):** Contains a region of 3s with a cross of blue markers. No other seed color is present. **Target: 3.**\n    *   **Middle-Left Region (Rows ~7-16):** Originally color 0. Contains blue markers enclosing a seed of color 8. **Target: 8.**\n    *   **Middle-Right Region (Rows ~7-22):** Originally color 2. Contains blue markers (lines/dots). No distinct seed color is found. **Target: 2.**\n    *   **Bottom-Left Region (Rows ~17-29):** Originally color 6. Contains blue markers. Adjacent to these markers is a seed of color 0. **Target: 0.**\n    *   **Bottom-Right Region (Rows ~23-29):** Originally color 8. Contains blue markers enclosing/adjacent to a seed of color 9. **Target: 9.**\n    *   **Background/Other:** Regions like the background 9s or the 4s on the right have no markers and are removed/overwritten.\n\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    *   The output grid dimensions match the input (30x30).\n    *   The regions are simplified into rectangles based on the approximate boundaries in the input.\n    *   **Vertical Boundary:** The split between Left and Right regions occurs around column 10 (based on the transition in the Middle row).\n    *   **Horizontal Boundaries:**\n        *   Top/Middle split: Row 7 (End of Top region).\n        *   Left side (8 -> 0) split: Row 17 (Start of markers in Bottom-Left region).\n        *   Right side (2 -> 9) split: Row 23 (Start of Region 8/9 transition).\n    *   **Layout:**\n        *   **Rows 0-6:** All **3**.\n        *   **Rows 7-16:** Left (Cols 0-9) is **8**; Right (Cols 10-29) is **2**.\n        *   **Rows 17-22:** Left (Cols 0-9) is **0**; Right (Cols 10-29) is **2** (Region 2 extends further down than Region 0/8 boundary).\n        *   **Rows 23-29:** Left (Cols 0-9) is **0**; Right (Cols 10-29) is **9**.\n\n    *Refining boundaries for simplicity:*\n    Looking at the simplified rectangular regions hint, the grid is composed of:\n    - Top Bar (3)\n    - Mid-Left Box (8)\n    - Mid-Right Box (2) (Taller than left)\n    - Bot-Left Box (0)\n    - Bot-Right Box (9)\n\n**Output Grid:**\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Exploration**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants me to solve this ARC task, which is basically about transforming grids of numbers. I have three examples and a test input to work with. The main thing seems to be that we have to figure out a rule for taking an input grid and generating a new, different output grid.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n*   **Inputs are Grids:** It is grids of integers (0-9).\n*   **Outputs are Transformed Grids:** We need to change the grid to be the new output grid.\n*   **The Examples are Crucial:** To get the logic we must figure out the examples!\n\nI've been going through the examples in detail. There are definite patterns, such as:\n\n*   **Colors are Important, maybe?** The numbers 0-9 are essentially colors. And they tend to cluster together in regions.\n*   **Rotation is Involved:** The aspect ratios change between input and output grids. This has to imply a rotation or transpose, or a very odd mapping going on.\n*   **Blue Polygons are Noise:** The blue numbers in the grid (represented by the number '1') seem to define boundaries or a shape. The hints say these are \"noise\" and removed.\n*   **Rectangular Regions:** The outputs are all made up of rectangles of the same numbers (colors).\n\n**Hypotheses and Testing**\n\nMy mind is jumping around, trying different ideas. It's almost certain that the solution involves understanding what those \"Blue\" polygons are, and how that relates to the \"Color\" or \"Region\" identification:\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: Direct Rotation.** Initially, I thought about simply rotating the input grid. I tried 90 degrees clockwise and counter-clockwise and a transpose. The simple rotations didn't directly match the color and shape changes in the examples.\n*   **Hypothesis 2: Region Identification & Transformation.** Maybe the blue polygons define regions. These regions are transformed based on their contents.\n\n**Rotation with a Twist?**\n\nI am starting to believe that a combination of a basic transformation (rotation) and region-based simplification is the way. Let's assume a 90 CW Rotation.\n\n*   Ex 4 is the KEY example, by looking at it, I can see what rotation is happening. The structure of Ex 4 strongly supports it.\n*   The hint is that: \"outputs are simplified into a small number of large axis-aligned rectangular regions\". Let's think about this and rotation. Maybe these rotations are the missing pieces?\n*   It's likely the problem is more complex than simple rotations. But rotation can get us closer, and we may have to account for some color-swapping during the rotation.\n*   Also, the key seems to be identifying the dominant color or number. The output blocks will all be the same color, this is what the output grid is!\n\n**Final Hypothesis and Construction**\n\nI think I have it now! It\u2019s all about a combination of Rotation and Color Expansion. Let's assume that we rotate the grid 90-degrees clockwise, and then \"fill\" regions in the Rotated grid.\n\nTo be even more concrete:\n\n1.  **Rotate 90 CW:** We are performing a rotation and a transpose.\n2.  **Color Expansion/Mapping:**\n    *   Find the \"blue\" shapes in the *original* grid.\n    *   In the *rotated* grid, these blue lines now create the boundaries of regions.\n    *   Figure out the \"dominant\" color (number) within each *original* region.\n    *   Fill the corresponding *rotated* region with the *dominant* color.\n\nI had to test all the examples to make sure it lined up and make sure I was not confused!\n\n**Applying the Hypothesis to the Test Input**\n\nI'm ready to apply this to the Test Input now. It's 30x30. After rotation it is still 30x30, so its shape does not change. I will rotate it and re-draw a new grid:\n\n1.  **Locate the rotated colors:**\n    *   Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise (the row becomes the column).\n    *   Use the \"blue lines\" to separate.\n    *   The \"blue lines\" determine the region locations and color-fill.\n\n2.  **Identify regions and fill the spaces:**\n    *   Take the dominant values! Fill in each new region.\n\n**Testing and Refinement**\n\nBy using the existing examples, let's look and refine to make sure I am getting the right regions and output values. By testing and re-reading the process, I can construct the new grid\n\nThe transformation involves two main steps:\n1.  **Rotation:** The grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. This changes the orientation of the regions and, in non-square examples, swaps the dimensions.\n2.  **Simplification/Denoising:** The rotated grid is partitioned into large, axis-aligned rectangular regions. The boundaries of these regions correspond to the \"blue polyomino\" lines (value 1) present in the original input. Within each region, a single dominant color fills the entire area, removing noise and merging smaller fragments. The color selection is based on the dominant non-blue color from the corresponding section of the input.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input (30x30):\n1.  **Rotation (90 CW):**\n    *   **Input Top** (9s) rotates to **Output Right**.\n    *   **Input Bottom** (8s, 6s) rotates to **Output Left**.\n    *   **Input Left** (9s, 3s, 6s) rotates to **Output Top**.\n    *   **Input Right** (9s, 3s, 4s, 8s) rotates to **Output Bottom**.\n\n2.  **Region Mapping:**\n    Based on the blue separators in the input (approx. rows 5, 13, 25 and cols 7, 23), the output grid is divided into a 3x4 grid of rectangular regions.\n    *   **Horizontal Divisions (Output Rows):**\n        *   Row 0-6 (7 rows): Corresponds to Input Left (Cols 0-7).\n        *   Row 7-22 (16 rows): Corresponds to Input Center (Cols 7-22).\n        *   Row 23-29 (7 rows): Corresponds to Input Right (Cols 23-29).\n    *   **Vertical Divisions (Output Cols):**\n        *   Col 0-3 (4 cols): Corresponds to Input Bottom (Rows 26-29).\n        *   Col 4-15 (12 cols): Corresponds to Input Lower-Mid (Rows 14-25).\n        *   Col 16-23 (8 cols): Corresponds to Input Upper-Mid (Rows 6-13).\n        *   Col 24-29 (6 cols): Corresponds to Input Top (Rows 0-5).\n\n3.  **Filling Colors:**\n    *   **Top Band (Rows 0-6):**\n        *   Col 0-3: **9** (From Input Bottom-Left corner).\n        *   Col 4-15: **6** (From Input Lower-Mid Left, Magenta region).\n        *   Col 16-23: **3** (From Input Upper-Mid Left, Green region).\n        *   Col 24-29: **9** (From Input Top Left, Maroon region).\n    *   **Middle Band (Rows 7-22):**\n        *   Col 0-3: **8** (From Input Bottom Center, Azure region).\n        *   Col 4-15: **2** (From Input Center, Red region).\n        *   Col 16-23: **3** (From Input Upper-Mid Center, Green region dominates).\n        *   Col 24-29: **9** (From Input Top Center).\n    *   **Bottom Band (Rows 23-29):**\n        *   Col 0-3: **8** (From Input Bottom Right).\n        *   Col 4-23: **4** (From Input Middle Right, Yellow region. Merged).\n        *   Col 24-29: **9** (From Input Top Right).\n\n9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9",

small input fragmentation disappears.\n* Output colors are a subset/remapping of input non-blue colors; some input colors vanish while others may expand.\n* The transformation likely works at the level of regions/partitions (merge/fill/relabel) rather than pixel-by-pixel motif copying.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

small input fragmentation disappears.\n* Output colors are a subset/remapping of input non-blue colors; some input colors vanish while others may expand.\n* The transformation likely works at the level of regions/partitions (merge/fill/relabel) rather than pixel-by-pixel motif copying.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

small input fragmentation disappears.\n* Output colors are a subset/remapping of input non-blue colors; some input colors vanish while others may expand.\n* The transformation likely works at the level of regions/partitions (merge/fill/relabel) rather than pixel-by-pixel motif copying.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

small input fragmentation disappears.\n* Output colors are a subset/remapping of input non-blue colors; some input colors vanish while others may expand.\n* The transformation likely works at the level of regions/partitions (merge/fill/relabel) rather than pixel-by-pixel motif copying.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\nAcross the 4 shown **input \u2192 output** pairs:\n\n### Common input structure\n- Each input is a bordered rectangular grid containing many colored areas.\n- There are **large, axis-aligned blocks/regions** of solid color that together form a \u201cpatchwork\u201d tiling.\n- Superimposed on or embedded within these larger regions are multiple **small dark-blue connected components** (polyomino/Tetris-like shapes).  \n- Some inputs also contain **tiny multicolor micro-blocks** (e.g., small 2\u00d72-ish clusters) embedded inside larger regions.\n\n### Common output structure\n- Each output is also a bordered rectangular grid.\n- Outputs are **much simpler**: mostly **large, solid, axis-aligned rectangular regions** with straight boundaries.\n- The **dark-blue polyomino pieces seen in inputs do not appear** in any output.\n- Outputs often use **a subset of the input\u2019s non-blue colors**; some input colors disappear.\n- The output regions often form **stripes/bands** (full-height vertical strips, full-width horizontal bands) or a small number of large rectangles.\n\n### Pair-specific notable changes\n- **Pair 1:** Input shows large magenta/orange/yellow blocks and a light-blue bottom band, plus small blue shapes and tiny colored clusters. Output has a big orange area, a large black rectangle, and a green \u201cbar/cross\u201d-like region; magenta/yellow/light-blue are not present.\n- **Pair 2:** Input is highly segmented with many colors and many blue shapes. Output becomes a small set of large rectangles (magenta-dominant, plus green, light-blue, orange stripe, and a small brown block).\n- **Pair 3:** Input contains multiple large regions (magenta/green/yellow/gray/light-blue/orange) plus many blue shapes. Output is a clean rectangular tiling using those non-blue colors, with blue removed.\n- **Pair 4:** Input has large red, magenta, yellow, and a green vertical stripe, plus many blue shapes. Output is a clean rectangular layout with magenta + green band + red stripe; yellow is absent.\n\nWhat clearly stays the same:\n- The overall \u201ccanvas\u201d shape (a single bordered grid) is preserved in each pair.\n- Outputs keep an orthogonal/rectangular aesthetic (no diagonals), similar to the \u201cblock layout\u201d feel of inputs, but with far fewer small details.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement:** maybe (hard to tell if regions actually relocate or if only recoloring/merging makes them *look* moved)\n- **Object recoloring:** present (output palettes differ; some colors replaced/vanish)\n- **Bordering / outlining:** absent\n- **Filling holes or cavities:** maybe (blue insertions disappear; could be treated as holes to be filled)\n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** present (blue polyominoes and small \u201cbusy\u201d details are removed in outputs)\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** maybe (outputs look like a reconstructed/clean layout rather than a direct cutout)\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center):** maybe (outputs often form edge-aligned stripes/bands)\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** maybe (dominant background-like color often remains; small colors sometimes expand)\n- **Size-based filtering or selection:** maybe (some colors disappear entirely; could be smallest regions removed/merged)\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations:** absent (no consistent mirror/rotation obvious across all 4)\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** maybe (small seeds/details vanish; large blocks become \u201ccleaner\u201d)\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** maybe (complex patchwork \u2192 simplified rectangular \u201cicon\u201d layout)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **Dark-blue components act like non-output material**: they appear repeatedly in inputs (often as small polyominoes) but are systematically absent in outputs, suggesting they are either \u201cnoise\u201d or \u201cmarkers\u201d whose geometry is not preserved.\n2. **Outputs strongly favor a small number of large, rectangular regions**, even when the input is highly fragmented. This implies a deliberate *rectangularization/merging* step rather than local pixel edits.\n3. **Some colors that are large/prominent in the input can vanish in the output** (e.g., yellow in pair 4; several in pair 1). This suggests the task is not simply \u201cremove blue,\u201d but also **select/relabel/merge** regions.\n4. **A color that is only minor in the input can become major in the output** (e.g., black/green in pair 1 appear to \u201cgrow\u201d relative to their apparent presence as small bits). This hints at **seed/label expansion** or **region relabeling** rather than area-preserving cleanup.\n5. **The output layouts look like \u201cclean top-level partitions\u201d** (bands/stripes/large rectangles). This suggests the rule operates on *region-level structure* (connected components, partitions) rather than on small motifs.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nMost likely family: **Region-based cleanup + relabeling.** The task appears to identify a coarse rectangular partition of the input (ignoring the dark-blue polyomino \u201cnoise/markers\u201d), then **reconstruct a simplified tiling** by merging/filling away the small embedded shapes. Colors of the resulting large regions may be **reassigned** (possibly using small embedded marker colors or a per-region \u201clabel\u201d signal), which can cause some input colors to disappear and others to dominate.\n\nAlternate family: **Extract a coarse \u201clayout icon\u201d** from the input (based on large regions after removing blue), and output that icon as a clean rectangular composition, potentially with a color remapping derived from small internal patches.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks you would perform when solving\n\n1. **Remove blue first and see if the remaining colors form the same rectangular partition as the output** (i.e., output might be input-with-blue-filled + recolor).\n2. **Compare region adjacency/partition lines** between input and output: do the same cuts (vertical/horizontal boundaries) exist, implying \u201csame layout, new colors\u201d?\n3. **Search for per-region \u201clabels\u201d**: within each big region, is there a small non-region-color patch whose color matches the region\u2019s output color?\n4. **Test size filtering**: are colors omitted in output always among the smallest total areas/regions in input?\n5. **Check for a \u201cpalette/mapping block\u201d** (small multicolor cluster) that could define input\u2192output color substitutions globally.\n\n---\n\n## 6.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into an ARC Task: From Initial Hypothesis to a Generalized Solution**\n\nAlright, let's break down this ARC problem. It looks like we're dealing with a grid-based puzzle where the key lies in understanding \"tiles,\" which are essentially solid-color rectangles, and how those rectangles interact with each other via directional \"arrows\" or markers. The goal is to figure out the output based on a series of examples and a test input.\n\nMy initial thought is this: the arrows are the conductors of colored \"payloads\" that move from one tile to another. The direction of the arrow determines the destination, and the tile's base color gets updated based on the payload. Some global rotations/transpositions might be involved.\n\nTo test this, let's dive into Example 1. After carefully examining the 16x12 grid and how it maps to a 12x16 output, I identified the rectangular regions and noticed distinct shapes that seem to be markers. By breaking down the top-left area, it was obvious we had a pattern: a T-shape or a plus-like shape within the \"tiles\" and used this pattern to understand the arrow direction. For each tile, I focused on the color of the central shape, and if it wasn't a one, it was the color that should be used as a payload. If the center was one, the base tile color was used. In Example 1, the transformation seemed to involve a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation because the output was the reverse of the input.\n\nMy focus shifted to identifying and mapping tiles, the payloads, and the impact of the arrows. I'm hypothesizing that the arrow pattern points in a specific direction (usually away from a vertical bar), and a color will get transferred. The puzzle involves calculating the final color of each tile.\n\nFor Example 1, I noticed something strange: the payload and the base color of the tile impacted the output. If two tiles merge, the color will transfer. I tried to generalize the rules, looking for patterns when tiles were modified in color. I carefully mapped out how colors propagated through the grid. The direction seems to be towards the \"missing\" side of the marker.\n\nAfter meticulously analyzing example 1, I shifted to a more general strategy:\n- Segmentation of a grid into tiles.\n- Identify the marker's structure.\n- Determine arrow payload based on arrow color.\n- Predict the transformations.\n\nI started applying this approach to a much larger test grid (30x30). The large grid made the previous analysis useful. I carefully identified a strategy to decompose the big test input into tiles. The test input had markers inside nested tiles. This was more complex, requiring multiple passes of understanding where colors spread.\n\nMy thought process then included the use of graphs and more sophisticated reasoning to understand how colors flowed within tiles. This required a new level of pattern-matching and generalization. The process took into account overlapping tiles and multiple arrow interactions. The final state was defined by the arrows and the flow of the colors.\n\nThe implementation details became crucial. I figured out a way to model the solution and predict the changes that happened.\n\n\nThe logic for determining the transformation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Segmentation**: The grid is segmented into rectangular regions of solid base colors. Small \"noise\" or interior details are ignored to determine the base color.\n2.  **Marker Detection**: \"Markers\" are patterns of `1`s (and sometimes a center pixel of another color) found within these regions. They act as directional arrows.\n    *   A \"T\" shape points in the direction of the \"missing\" arm (or away from the crossbar/towards the stem).\n        *   `|-` (vertical bar left, protrusion right) points **Right**.\n        *   `-|` (vertical bar right, protrusion left) points **Left**.\n        *   `_|_` (inverted T) points **Up**.\n        *   `T` (standard T) points **Down**.\n    *   A \"+\" (Plus) shape points in **All 4 Directions**.\n3.  **Payload Determination**:\n    *   If the center of the marker is `1`, the payload is the **Base Color** of the tile containing the marker.\n    *   If the center of the marker is NOT `1`, that center color is the payload.\n4.  **Interaction**:\n    *   The payload is \"fired\" into the adjacent tile(s) in the indicated direction(s).\n    *   The target tile changes its color to the payload color.\n    *   This can cause a chain reaction or simultaneous updates. (e.g., A targets B, B targets C).\n    *   In the test input, we have:\n        *   **Tile C (3s)**: Marker (Up) -> Payload 3 -> Targets **Top 9s**. Top 9s become **3**.\n        *   **Tile D/G (0s)**: Marker (Plus) -> Payload 0 -> Targets **Tile E (2s)** and **Tile F (6s)**. E and F become **0**.\n        *   **Tile E (2s)**: Marker (Up) -> Payload 2 -> Targets **Tile D (0s)**. D becomes **2**.\n        *   **Tile 9 (8s)**: Marker (Plus) -> Payload 8 -> Targets neighbors (**4s**, **Right/Bottom 9s**). They become **8**.\n        *   **Tile B (7s)**: No incoming, no outgoing. Stays **7**.\n        *   **Tile Left 9s**: No incoming.

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Solving ARC Problems: My Thought Process**\n\nOkay, here's how I tackle these ARC problems. First, I try to understand the core logic by looking at the problem description and examples. It seems like the inputs are composed of tiles with a main color and maybe some \"marker\" patterns in a contrasting color. These markers are critical because they seem to indicate a direction. The directional marker points to a neighboring tile. The direction is determined by the specific shape or position of the marker inside the tile. The \"Head\" or missing edge of the shape gives us the direction. A key point is that the marker triggers actions: a color transfer to the targeted neighbor.\n\nI carefully examine the examples, paying attention to the input and output. I check the dimensions and look for any transpositions or rotations. It seems that there are two distinct types of marker rules that can exist. One has the \"head\" pointing to the target cell (similar to an arrow), and the other has a \"missing edge\" of the shape telling the cell where to move to.\n\nIn Example 1, I worked out the marker shapes. One rule had the arrow pointing down, indicating the neighbor cell should be changed to the center cell color.\n\nI then built a hypothesis. 1) Segment the input grid into the main tiles. 2) I identify all markers and determine their directions. 3)  Based on the direction, find the neighboring tile and decide the action, which usually involves changing the neighbor's color. Then I construct the output by modifying tiles.\n\nThe problem got tricky in Example 1. I had trouble with the meaning of the markers and if the direction pointed to the target. It seems like the \"Head\" means the color is moved there. The Head of the Marker shape points in the direction of the arrow. This means 3 things: a) Marker Location, b) Color, and c) Direction, which must be interpreted to make a successful solution.\n\nIn the Test Input, I got a bit of an idea. It seems like the action is to find a boundary tile and change its color to match the marker's shape color. The process is to first find solid-colored tiles and make a grid. Then I will identify the tile borders and marker regions. I carefully identify these to get a solid direction for all actions. I will carefully identify the regions and make sure there are no other internal markers that may disrupt the solution.\n\nUltimately, I needed to check and recheck my rules against the examples to make sure they were consistently giving me the correct answers. Once I've verified the rules, I can apply them to the Test Input.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of colored tiles based on \"arrow\" markers formed by the color `1`. The transformation involves identifying these markers, determining the direction they point, and moving a payload color to the adjacent tile in that direction. The grid is then segmented and filled with the final colors.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution Logic:**\n\n1.  **Segmentation:**\n    The grid is composed of rectangular regions (tiles) of solid colors (ignoring small internal details). We identify these tiles in the Input:\n    -   **Tile A (Top Background):** Color `9`. Covers the top/left surrounding area.\n    -   **Tile B (Top-Center):** Color `3`. Large rectangular block inside the top `9` area.\n    -   **Tile C (Top-Right):** Color `7`. Small block in the top right corner.\n    -   **Tile D (Bottom-Left):** Color `6`. Block on the mid-to-bottom left.\n    -   **Tile E (Bottom-Center):** Color `2`. Block to the right of Tile D.\n    -   **Tile F (Right Strip):** Color `4`. Vertical strip on the right edge.\n    -   **Tile G (Bottom-Right):** Color `8`. Block in the bottom right corner.\n    -   **Tile H (Bottom Background):** Color `9`. Strip at the very bottom, below D, E, G.\n\n2.  **Marker Detection & Direction:**\n    Markers are patterns of `1`s centered around a pixel. The direction is determined by the \"head\" of the pattern (the side with a single pixel, or opposite the missing side of the cross).\n    -   **In Tile B (Color 3):** There is a marker at the top `(Row 2-3)`. The pattern has `1`s at Top, Left, Right relative to the center `1`. This shape corresponds to an arrow pointing **Up**.\n        -   **Action:** Tile B points to its neighbor above, **Tile A**.\n        -   **Payload:** Center is `1`, so payload is the tile's base color **3**.\n    -   **In Tile E (Color 2):** There are two markers.\n        1.  Top marker `(Row 9-10)`: `1`s at Top, Left, Right. Points **Up**.\n            -   **Action:** Tile E points to its neighbor above, **Tile B**.\n            -   **Payload:** Base color **2**.\n        2.  Left marker `(Row 20-22)`: `1`s at Top, Right, Bottom. Points **Left**.\n            -   **Action:** Tile E points to its neighbor to the left, **Tile D**.\n            -   **Payload:** Base color **2**.\n    -   **In Tile D (Color 6):** Marker at `(Row 17-18)`. `1`s at Left, Right, Bottom. Points **Down**.\n        -   **Action:** Tile D points to its neighbor below, **Tile H**.\n        -   **Payload:** Base color **6**.\n    -   **Other Tiles (A, C, F, G, H):** No valid directional markers found.\n\n3.  **Applying Transformations:**\n    -   **Tile A** receives color **3** from Tile B. (Old 9 -> New 3).\n    -   **Tile B** receives color **2** from Tile E. (Old 3 -> New 2).\n    -   **Tile D** receives color **2** from Tile E. (Old 6 -> New 2).\n    -   **Tile H** receives color **6** from Tile D. (Old 9 -> New 6).\n    -   **Tile E** has no incoming arrows, so it remains **2**.\n    -   **Tile C** remains **7**.\n    -   **Tile F** remains **4**.\n    -   **Tile G** remains **8**.\n\n4.  **Final Cleanup:**\n    -   Remove markers and fill tiles with their new colors.\n    -   Merge adjacent tiles of the same color (Tile B, D, E all become 2, forming a large central region).\n\n5.  **Global Transformation:**\n    -   Check input dimensions. The test input is square (30x30), so no global transpose is needed (consistent with Example 2 and 4).\n\n**Final Color Mapping:**\n-   Top area (was 9) -> **3**\n-   Top-Right (was 7) -> **7**\n-   Middle/Center area (was 3) -> **2**\n-   Bottom-Left (was 6) -> **2**\n-   Bottom-Center (was 2) -> **2**\n-   Right Edge (was 4) -> **4**\n-   Bottom-Right (was 8) -> **8**\n-   Bottom Edge (was 9) -> **6**\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,8,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,8,8,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

Each section has a solid color (0-9). Some sections contain a centered feature, often a single pixel or a plus sign in color 1.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Segment the grid into solid-color rectangular tiles (ignore small interior decorations when finding the tile base color).  \n- Detect centered marker patterns in color `1` (often T/plus-like); treat them as directional arrows.  \n- Determine a payload color: use the arrow-center color if it is not `1`, otherwise use the tile\u2019s base color.  \n- Transfer the payload to the adjacent tile in the arrow direction and recolor the entire destination tile; swaps can occur via opposing arrows.  \n- Remove all `1` markers and output each tile as a uniform fill of its final color; same-colored neighbors merge.  \n- In some cases, apply a global 90\u00b0 rotation / transpose that swaps grid dimensions (seen when input is non-square).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Each section has a solid color (0-9). Some sections contain a centered feature, often a single pixel or a plus sign in color 1.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Segment the grid into solid-color rectangular tiles (ignore small interior decorations when finding the tile base color).  \n- Detect centered marker patterns in color `1` (often T/plus-like); treat them as directional arrows.  \n- Determine a payload color: use the arrow-center color if it is not `1`, otherwise use the tile\u2019s base color.  \n- Transfer the payload to the adjacent tile in the arrow direction and recolor the entire destination tile; swaps can occur via opposing arrows.  \n- Remove all `1` markers and output each tile as a uniform fill of its final color; same-colored neighbors merge.  \n- In some cases, apply a global 90\u00b0 rotation / transpose that swaps grid dimensions (seen when input is non-square).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Each section has a solid color (0-9). Some sections contain a centered feature, often a single pixel or a plus sign in color 1.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Segment the grid into solid-color rectangular tiles (ignore small interior decorations when finding the tile base color).  \n- Detect centered marker patterns in color `1` (often T/plus-like); treat them as directional arrows.  \n- Determine a payload color: use the arrow-center color if it is not `1`, otherwise use the tile\u2019s base color.  \n- Transfer the payload to the adjacent tile in the arrow direction and recolor the entire destination tile; swaps can occur via opposing arrows.  \n- Remove all `1` markers and output each tile as a uniform fill of its final color; same-colored neighbors merge.  \n- In some cases, apply a global 90\u00b0 rotation / transpose that swaps grid dimensions (seen when input is non-square).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Identify rectangular tiles by their dominant color (ignoring markers in color 1)\n2. Find arrow patterns made of 1s, which indicate color transfers between tiles\n3. Determine payload colors (the center of an arrow if it's not 1, otherwise the tile's base color)\n4. Apply color transfers based on arrow directions\n5. Replace all cells with their tile's final color\n\n**Identifying tiles and arrows in the test input:**\n\nMain tiles:\n- **9** (maroon): Background\n- **3** (green): Upper interior region\n- **0** (black): Middle-left interior  \n- **2** (red): Central region\n- **6** (magenta): Lower-left\n- **4** (yellow): Right side\n- **7** (orange): Small upper-right area\n- **8** (azure): Lower-right\n\n**Arrows and their effects:**\n1. In 3-tile (rows 2-3): downward arrow \u2192 3 goes to 0-tile\n2. In 9-tile (rows 5-6): upward arrow \u2192 9 goes to 7-tile\n3. In 0-tile (rows 7-8): plus with center **8** \u2192 8 goes to 3-tile\n4. In 2-tile (rows 9-10): upward arrow \u2192 2 goes to 0-tile\n5. In 0-tile (rows 17-18): downward arrow \u2192 0 goes to 6-tile\n6. In 6-tile (rows 20-22): rightward arrow \u2192 6 goes to 2-tile\n7. In 8-tile (rows 25-26): upward arrow \u2192 8 goes to 4-tile\n8. In 9/8 boundary (rows 27-29): rightward arrow with center **0** \u2192 0 goes to 8-tile\n\n**Final color mappings:**\n- 3 \u2192 8, 0 \u2192 2, 2 \u2192 6, 6 \u2192 0, 4 \u2192 8, 7 \u2192 9, 8 \u2192 0, 9 \u2192 9\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n9,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,0,0,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,0,0,0,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

Each section has a solid color (0-9). Some sections contain a centered feature, often a single pixel or a plus sign in color 1.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Segment the grid into solid-color rectangular tiles (ignore small interior decorations when finding the tile base color).  \n- Detect centered marker patterns in color `1` (often T/plus-like); treat them as directional arrows.  \n- Determine a payload color: use the arrow-center color if it is not `1`, otherwise use the tile\u2019s base color.  \n- Transfer the payload to the adjacent tile in the arrow direction and recolor the entire destination tile; swaps can occur via opposing arrows.  \n- Remove all `1` markers and output each tile as a uniform fill of its final color; same-colored neighbors merge.  \n- In some cases, apply a global 90\u00b0 rotation / transpose that swaps grid dimensions (seen when input is non-square).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

In 6 region (rows 20-22, col 12): payload 6, points right \u2192 goes to 2\n6. In 8/9 boundary (rows 27-29, col 12): center is **0**, payload 0 \u2192 goes to 8\n\n**Color Transformations:**\n- 3 receives 8 (from arrow with payload 8) \u2192 becomes **8**\n- 7 stays **7** (no incoming arrow)\n- 4 receives 7 \u2192 becomes **7**\n- 0 receives 3 \u2192 becomes **3**\n- 2 receives 6 \u2192 becomes **6**\n- 6 receives 0 \u2192 becomes **0**\n- 8 receives 0 \u2192 becomes **0**\n- 9 stays **9**\n\nApplying these transformations to match the input structure:\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,7,7,7,9,9,7\n9,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7\n9,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,0,0,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,0,0,0,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

                "response": "**My Analysis of the Grid Objects**\n\nOkay, so I've been given a bunch of grids filled with numbers, essentially representing colored regions. My task is to describe the types of objects within these grids, keeping it general and avoiding inferences about rules. I'm focusing only on the visual characteristics, using only the numeric color values (0-9).\n\nFirst, I'm observing a very consistent structure: the grids are dominated by rectangular regions. They're like tiles, fitting together to fill the entire space. These rectangles are the primary objects. They vary in size \u2013 some are long and thin, others more square, and the widths and heights change a lot. The color of each rectangle is solid, and there's a good variety of colors used (0 through 9).\n\nNow, inside *some* of these rectangles, I see a secondary feature. These secondary objects are like markers or internal decorations. They're usually centered within the rectangular region. The most common shape is a \"plus\" sign or cross, built out of color 1 pixels. Sometimes, it's just a single pixel of color 1. There are occasionally slightly more complex patterns, like a 3x3 arrangement, which might also include colors other than 1 as part of the center pattern. These could be small details of color 0, or something else. But the color 1 marker is very common.\n\nSo, it's pretty straightforward. The grids are made of rectangular sections of solid color. Many of them have a little pattern in the middle. The important thing is that these sections partition the grids.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n`<objects_summary>The grids are composed of rectangular sections (tiles). Each section has a solid color (0-9). Some sections contain a centered feature, often a single pixel or a plus sign in color 1.</objects_summary>`\n\n\nBased on the visual data provided in the grids, the objects can be categorized into two main types based on their structural role and attributes:\n\n**1. Rectangular Color Blocks (Containers)**\nThe primary objects constituting the structure of every grid are rectangular regions that tile the entire grid space.\n*   **Geometry:** These objects are strictly rectangular, varying in width and height. They fit together like a mosaic to fill the grid dimensions completely without overlapping.\n*   **Fill:** Each rectangular block is filled with a uniform, solid background color.\n*   **Colors:** The background colors vary widely across the grids, utilizing almost all numeric values (e.g., 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n\n**2. Central Markers (Contents)**\nNested within many of the Rectangular Color Blocks are smaller, distinct pixel patterns.\n*   **Position:** These are located centrally within their respective parent rectangular block.\n*   **Geometry:** The most common shapes are a single pixel or a \"plus\" sign (a cross shape, typically occupying a 3x3 area). In some larger blocks, the pattern is slightly more complex, forming small rings or scattered pixels within a 3x3 center.\n*   **Colors:** The most predominant color for these markers is color 1. However, other colors (such as 0, 7, or 8) occasionally appear as part of these internal details, often bordering or accenting the center pixel.\n*   **Relationship:** Not every rectangular block contains a marker; some remain solid blocks of color. When present, the marker contrasts with the background color of the rectangular block.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Rectangular Color Blocks: Tiled regions of varying dimensions filling the grid, characterized by a uniform solid background color (values 0-9).\n2. Central Markers: Internal patterns nested in the center of color blocks, typically shaped as single pixels or plus signs, predominantly using color 1.\n</objects_summary>",

Each section has a solid color (0-9). Some sections contain a centered feature, often a single pixel or a plus sign in color 1.",
                "response": "### 1) Scene decomposition (object extraction)\n- Treat the input as a **mosaic of axis-aligned rectangular tiles** (rectangles whose pixels are a single \u201cbase/background\u201d color, except for small centered decorations).\n- For each tile, determine its **base color** as the dominant non-`1` color in that rectangle (the solid fill color).\n\n### 2) Feature/marker handling inside tiles\n- Many tiles contain a small **centered marker drawn in `1`** (often a plus-like or **T-like** shape).\n- Some tiles also contain a **single non-`1` pixel at/near the marker center** (e.g., `0`, `3`, `6`, `7`, `9`). This pixel can act as a \u201cpayload/label\u201d color.\n\n**Possible transformations on these features:**\n- **Erase markers:** all `1` pixels used as markers are removed in the output (replaced by the final tile fill), so `1` does not appear in the output.\n- **Expand payload:** if a tile contains a single \u201cpayload\u201d pixel (non-`1`, not the tile base), that color can be **promoted** to recolor an entire tile in the output.\n\n### 3) Interpreting the `1`-marker as a direction (arrow logic)\nA recurring interpretation consistent with several pairs:\n- The `1`-marker forms a **T shape** (3 pixels in a line plus 1 perpendicular pixel), which can be read as a **directional arrow**.\n- The **arrow direction** is given by the **single protruding arm** of the T (up/down/left/right).\n- The **payload color** associated with that arrow is:\n  - the **center pixel color** if the center is not `1` (e.g., `9`, `6`, `0`, `3`, `7`), otherwise\n  - the tile\u2019s **base/background color**.\n\n### 4) Tile-to-tile color transfer / permutation\nUsing the directional marker, a tile can **send** its payload color into a neighbor:\n\n- **Identify the target tile** in the arrow direction (adjacent tile beyond the arrow arm).\n- **Recolor the entire target tile** in the output with the payload color.\n\nThis produces common sub-effects seen in the examples:\n- **Swaps:** if two neighboring tiles point at each other, their base colors can effectively swap in the output.\n- **Recoloring by \u201cinjected\u201d colors:** a single pixel payload (e.g., `6` or `9`) can recolor a whole destination tile.\n- **Multiple arrows in one tile:** a single source tile may contain more than one T-marker, potentially sending the same payload in multiple directions.\n\n**Conflict/priority (when multiple sends hit one tile):**\n- The examples are compatible with \u201cone effective incoming assignment per tile\u201d, but if multiple arrows target the same tile, plausible resolution rules include:\n  - prefer payloads where the center is non-`1` (explicit payload) over those using the background as payload,\n  - prefer the last/first arrow found in scan order,\n  - prefer a specific direction order (e.g., vertical over horizontal),\n  - or choose the most frequent incoming payload.\n\n### 5) Output tile rendering (uniform fill + merging)\nAfter transfers:\n- **Every tile is rendered as a solid rectangle** in the output using its final assigned color.\n- All marker geometry is discarded (no `1` remains).\n- Adjacent rectangles that end up the **same color visually merge** into larger uniform regions (boundaries disappear because colors match).\n\n### 6) Whole-grid geometric transform (dimension swap)\nTwo of the training pairs show **height/width swapped** between input and output, while area is preserved. This is consistent with an additional global transform such as:\n- **Rotate 90\u00b0** (clockwise *or* counterclockwise), or equivalently\n- **Transpose** plus a flip.\n\nA plausible conditional variant:\n- Apply the rotation/transpose **only when input height \u2260 input width** (to standardize orientation); square cases would not show a size change.\n\n---\n\n<transformation_summary>\n- Segment the grid into solid-color rectangular tiles (ignore small interior decorations when finding the tile base color).  \n- Detect centered marker patterns in color `1` (often T/plus-like); treat them as directional arrows.  \n- Determine a payload color: use the arrow-center color if it is not `1`, otherwise use the tile\u2019s base color.  \n- Transfer the payload to the adjacent tile in the arrow direction and recolor the entire destination tile; swaps can occur via opposing arrows.  \n- Remove all `1` markers and output each tile as a uniform fill of its final color; same-colored neighbors merge.  \n- In some cases, apply a global 90\u00b0 rotation / transpose that swaps grid dimensions (seen when input is non-square).  \n</transformation_summary>",

Each section has a solid color (0-9). Some sections contain a centered feature, often a single pixel or a plus sign in color 1.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Segment the grid into solid-color rectangular tiles (ignore small interior decorations when finding the tile base color).  \n- Detect centered marker patterns in color `1` (often T/plus-like); treat them as directional arrows.  \n- Determine a payload color: use the arrow-center color if it is not `1`, otherwise use the tile\u2019s base color.  \n- Transfer the payload to the adjacent tile in the arrow direction and recolor the entire destination tile; swaps can occur via opposing arrows.  \n- Remove all `1` markers and output each tile as a uniform fill of its final color; same-colored neighbors merge.  \n- In some cases, apply a global 90\u00b0 rotation / transpose that swaps grid dimensions (seen when input is non-square).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
