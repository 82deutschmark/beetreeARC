        "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I have to figure out the rule based on three examples. My initial focus is to analyze the input and output grids.\n\n**Input Grids**\n\nAll the input grids are 6x6. Each one has a background color, which is always orange (7), and another color which forms some kind of specific pattern. I'm going through each example, painstakingly writing out the color codes at specific coordinates, trying to grasp the visual logic. For the first example, I see a green plus shape.\n\nI'm thinking, \"Is there a relationship between the colors and shapes?\" The second input looks like a blue diamond or an 'H' shape, or is it more like corners and center? Let's check coordinates. I'm noting specific coordinates that define the shape.  The third has a magenta 'X'.\n\nI'm starting to consider how each input color/shape influences the output. I'm also carefully checking the test input. What's the pattern? Two red dots in the corners. Okay, it's starting to look like each input has a 3x3 pattern in a 6x6 grid. Maybe this local 3x3 pattern is the key.\n\n**Output Grids**\n\nI'm now switching to the output grids, and they're all 16x16. These are way bigger! I am observing how it might be constructed from smaller, repeating units. Are they 5x5 blocks? Maybe 3x3 scaled up? Let's look at the outputs... I see rows and columns of zeros, which suggests some kind of tiling or a grid structure. \n\nI'm getting closer, and it seems like the output is made of these repeating \"macro-pixels.\" Rows 0, 3, 6, etc., and columns 0, 3, 6, etc., have zeros. I\u2019m starting to think about horizontal and vertical \"grid lines\" that define these repeating macro-pixels. There are these bold maroon (color 9) patches in the middle that really pop out. The 9s form this rectangular region, it's probably the visual highlight. I see they are not in all locations. Okay, it's 5x5. The zeros act as separators! I will call these the grid lines.\n\n**Connecting Input and Output**\n\nNow, I'm trying to connect the dots between the input and output. The output seems to replicate a smaller grid from the input. What is the relation between the color in the inputs, and the shape or tile style in the output. The output grids seem to be made of 5x5 blocks. So, is there a 5x5 input to output correspondence? Each input seems to have a centered 3x3 pattern in each grid. I start comparing the input and output grids side by side. I'm seeing 7s in some output cells, and 0s in others. How is the tile color related to the colors in the input pattern? The output tiles have 7s, 0s and 9s. I can see 0s for the lines. I am realizing that maybe this 5x5 output is a zoomed-in representation of the 3x3 input pattern.\n\nI look closer at the 9s. The 9s seem to be in this kind of central frame around one of the cells. The 9's overwrite any other color. I think the 9s are always centered around a tile and only overwrite the center tile and one pixel on its adjacent tiles.\n\n**Discovering the Pattern**\n\nHere's my hypothesis: The output is a 5x5 grid of 2x2 blocks separated by 1-pixel lines. And, the key is this 3x3 region in the input, because that's what seems to define how the output is styled. And I realize, based on examples, there are a few texture styles. The style is not a one-to-one mapping, though. The colors of the grid lines vs the colors of the tiles. In some examples, the lines are black, tiles are orange; in others, the lines are orange, tiles are black.\n\nThis is my insight! The output grid texture is determined by the input 3x3 pattern. Let's look at the three examples, one-by-one! For instance, the horizontal and vertical lines will have specific colors. It appears that horizontal lines match with the horizontal mid-row pixels from the input, while vertical lines match with the vertical-mid col in the input.\n\nEx 1: If mid row is full (all 3 values of the color), then the output has Black horizontal lines. Same for the cols. If the tile has some pattern, the texture will be a tile\n\nThe transformation involves identifying a 3x3 pattern within the input grid and generating a 16x16 output grid based on specific features of that pattern. The output grid is a structured 5x5 array of 2x2 tiles separated by 1-pixel wide grid lines.\n\n**Logic derived from examples:**\n1.  **Pattern Extraction:**\n    -   Locate the 3x3 region in the 6x6 input that contains the colored pattern (non-7 values).\n    -   **Test Input Pattern:** The pattern is a 3x3 box formed by Red (2) pixels at the corners `(0,2), (0,4), (2,2), (2,4)`. The rest of the 3x3 area is empty (7).\n        -   Top Row: `2 7 2` (Corners filled)\n        -   Middle Row: `7 7 7` (Empty)\n        -   Bottom Row: `2 7 2` (Corners filled)\n        -   Middle Column: `7 7 7` (Empty)\n\n2.  **Determine Output Grid Style (Texture):**\n    -   The style of the grid lines (Horizontal/Vertical) and the Tiles depends on the fullness of the 3x3 pattern's rows/columns.\n    -   **Horizontal Lines:** If the Middle Row of the pattern is full (contains pattern colors), the lines are Black (0). If empty, they are Orange (7).\n        -   Test Middle Row is empty -> **Horizontal Lines = 7**.\n    -   **Vertical Lines:** If the Middle Column of the pattern is full, the lines are Black (0). If empty, they are Orange (7).\n        -   Test Middle Column is empty -> **Vertical Lines = 7**.\n    -   **Tiles:** If the pattern corners are filled, the tiles are Black (0). If empty, they are Orange (7).\n        -   Test Corners are filled -> **Tiles = 0**.\n    -   **Intersections:** Grid line intersections are always Black (0).\n\n3.  **Construct Base Grid:**\n    -   The grid is 16x16. Lines are at indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n    -   Based on the style determined:\n        -   **Intersections:** (0,0), (0,3)... are 0.\n        -   **Horizontal Segments:** (0,1), (0,2), (0,4)... are 7.\n        -   **Vertical Segments:** (1,0), (2,0), (4,0)... are 7.\n        -   **Tiles:** (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)... are 0.\n\n4.  **Apply Highlight Overlay:**\n    -   A highlight box is applied to the center of the grid, specifically covering the area from **rows 6 to 9** and **columns 5 to 10**.\n    -   **Rule:** In this region, any pixel that is Black (0) becomes Maroon (9). Pixels that are Orange (7) remain Orange (7).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\nThe Test Input pattern features (Empty Middle Row, Empty Middle Column, Filled Corners) match exactly with Example 3. Therefore, the output grid will be identical to the output of Example 3.\n\n**Output Grid generation:**\n-   **Rows 0, 3, 12, 15 (Base Lines):** `0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n-   **Rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 13, 14 (Base Tiles):** `7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n-   **Rows 6, 9 (Center Lines with Overlay):**\n    -   Base: `0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n    -   Overlay (cols 5-10): Change 0 to 9.\n    -   Result: `0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n-   **Rows 7, 8 (Center Tiles with Overlay):**\n    -   Base: `7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n    -   Overlay (cols 5-10): Change 0 to 9.\n    -   Result: `7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7`\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Final Algorithm and Reasoning for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I've been dissecting this ARC task for a while, and I think I've cracked it. The goal is to take a 6x6 input grid and transform it into a 16x16 output grid, and the transformation depends on a few factors. Let's break it down:\n\n**Input Analysis:** The input grids all have a dominant orange background (color 7) and a secondary pattern of a different color. I see the patterns as sort of a plus sign, a diamond, and an \"X,\" respectively, in the examples. Importantly, there are no overlaps in the patterns, and they are embedded within a larger array. The test input has 4 dots, which forms the corners of a square (::).\n\n**Output Structure:** The 16x16 output grids have a distinct grid-like structure. They are composed of a series of 2x2 \"tiles\" separated by single-pixel \"lines,\" creating a 5x5 array of tiles (where 5 * 3 + 1 = 16 pixels per side). I noticed that the color of these lines and tiles isn't random; it's a key part of the transformation.\n\n**Key Insight: The input pattern determines the output Style, not the content of each tile.** The core idea is that the output visually represents the presence of a pattern in the input (I was initially going down the path of trying to build the tiles based on pixel-by-pixel, and this was not the case). The important concept is the background/Tile Style and the Highlight shape. This is what changes based on the input pattern.\n\n**Style and Color Mapping:** There is a clear mapping between the secondary color in the input and the overall output style. The input color's \"style\" has 3 parts: H-lines, V-lines, and Tiles. The style is not a direct encoding but a code based on the binary bits of the color. In my examples:\n- Color 3 (Green) -> Tiles (Black lines, colored tile. Tiles=7, Lines=0).\n- Color 1 (Blue) -> Vertical Lines (Black tiles, color V-lines. Tiles=0, V-Lines=7).\n- Color 6 (Magenta) -> Grid (H and V Lines are color. Tiles=0, H-lines=7, V-lines=7).\n- Color 2 (Test-Red) -> Horizontal lines.\n\n**The Highlight (Center Box):** This is the final piece of the puzzle. There is a consistent \"highlight\" region in the output, always centered on the center tile (T(2,2)) of the 5x5 tile grid. This highlight is a 6x6 box, 0-indexed Cols 5-10, Rows 5-10. This 6x6 box replaces all 0 values with a highlight value (9), masking anything that is already 7. The highlight shape is *always* 6x6, and it overrides the style. It changes based on the Input Color/Style.\n\n**The output Highlight shape:** This *always* creates a 6x6 rectangle that visually expands from the center, creating a highlight, and the spill can vary based on the Style.\n\n**In summary:**\n1.  **Read the Input.**\n2.  **Determine the Output Style:** Identify which style to build based on the input pattern color.\n3.  **Construct the Base Grid:** Create the 16x16 grid with the base tile and line colors dictated by the selected output style.\n4.  **Apply the Highlight:** Always fill the 6x6 Highlight Box with color 9 *replacing* the underlying 0 value, not the 7 value, thus preserving the tile/line separation.\n5.  **Output the result.**\n\nThe critical aspect is understanding that the color of the tiles and lines in the output is linked directly to the color of the pattern in the input, not the pixel content. It's about a visual representation of presence, not a direct pixel-by-pixel copy or mapping of the image. The pattern in the input gives an indicator of the visual transformation which, in turn, is a visual grid style with a highlight.\n\n\nThe task requires inferring the transformation rule from 6x6 input grids to 16x16 output grids. The input grids contain a background of color 7 (orange) with a geometric pattern of another color. The output grids are stylized representations of a $5 \\times 5$ tile grid, where the style and a central highlight are determined by the input pattern's color.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Output Structure**: The output is always a $16 \\times 16$ grid representing $5 \\times 5$ tiles. Each tile is $2 \\times 2$ pixels, separated by 1-pixel wide grid lines.\n    *   Tiles correspond to rows/cols indices: 1-2, 4-5, 7-8, 10-11, 13-14.\n    *   Grid lines correspond to rows/cols indices: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n\n2.  **Base Style Determined by Input Pattern Color**:\n    *   **Color 3 (Green)** $\\to$ **Tiles Style**: Tiles are filled with color 7, lines are color 0. (Example 1)\n    *   **Color 1 (Blue)** $\\to$ **Vertical Lines Style**: Vertical grid lines are color 7, tiles and horizontal lines are color 0. (Example 2)\n    *   **Color 6 (Magenta)** $\\to$ **Grid Style**: Vertical and horizontal grid lines are color 7 (intersections are 0), tiles are color 0. (Example 3)\n    *   **Test Input Color 2 (Red)**: Following the logic (1=Vertical, 6=Grid/Both, 3=Tiles), color 2 maps to **Horizontal Lines Style**.\n        *   Horizontal grid lines (rows 0, 3, 6...) are color 7 (segments) with 0 at intersections.\n        *   Vertical grid lines and tiles are color 0.\n\n3.  **Highlight Rule**:\n    *   A \"Highlight\" of color 9 (Maroon) is applied to a specific region of the output grid.\n    *   The region is a **$6 \\times 6$ square centered on the grid**.\n    *   Region coordinates: Rows 5-10, Columns 5-10.\n    *   **Application Rule**: In this region, any pixel that is 0 becomes 9. Pixels that are 7 remain 7.\n\n**Constructing the Test Output:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Base Grid (Horizontal Lines Style)**\n    *   Horizontal Grid Rows (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15): The pattern is `0, 7, 7, 0` repeated.\n        *   Row sequence: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n    *   All other rows (Tiles and Vertical Lines): Filled with `0`.\n\n*   **Step 2: Apply Highlight**\n    *   Target Region: Rows 5 through 10, Columns 5 through 10.\n    *   **Row 5 (Tile Row)**: Originally all `0`. Columns 5-10 become `9`.\n        *   `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`\n    *   **Row 6 (Grid Row)**: Originally `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0...`.\n        *   Col 5 is 7 (stays 7).\n        *   Col 6 is 0 (becomes 9).\n        *   Cols 7-8 are 7 (stay 7).\n        *   Col 9 is 0 (becomes 9).\n        *   Col 10 is 7 (stays 7).\n        *   Result: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n    *   **Rows 7, 8 (Tile Rows)**: Originally all `0`. Columns 5-10 become `9`.\n        *   `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`\n    *   **Row 9 (Grid Row)**: Identical to Row 6.\n    *   **Row 10 (Tile Row)**: Identical to Row 5.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**The user has presented an ARC task with three example input-output pairs and a test input, and their task is to solve it.  They dive into analyzing the examples to identify a pattern or rule that explains the transformation.**\n\nThey start by examining the input grids, noting that they are all 6x6 with a consistent orange (7) background and a shape of another color. They index the pixels from (0,0) and observe the shape in each example: a plus sign (Example 1), a diamond (Example 2), and an 'X' (Example 3).\n\nNext, they study the output grids. The outputs are 16x16. The user immediately recognizes that the output appears to be a tiled representation of some underlying structure and starts to look at how the 6x6 input transforms into the 16x16 output. They investigate the spacing in the output and discover a pattern of separators that form a 5x5 grid of 2x2 blocks with 1-pixel-wide lines in between, and then attempt to relate this arrangement to the input size. They form a hypothesis that perhaps only the inner 5x5 of the input determines the structure.\n\nThen, they attempt to create a mapping from input coordinates to output coordinates and begin to evaluate the color patterns in the output, focusing on how different shapes translate from inputs to outputs. They become fixated on a 9-maroon color that appears as a box in the output, around a central block, and realize that this box is always at the center of the output grid.\n\nThe user then starts looking more deeply into the rules for the 9-pattern and becomes fixated on the underlying rule that determines how 0s and 7s are arranged in the output grid. They find a few cases for each example (7 at the edges of the boxes, blocks, or nothing at all), and start to construct different logic rules that may work for each case.  They recognize that the separators (grid lines) have different colors in different examples. They hypothesize the \"base grid\" (without the 9s) is built from logical operations on whether a row/col is a separator.\n\nThe user forms a hypothesis that is critical to solving the ARC problem, that the \"Base Grid\" pattern depends on the Input color/shape, and formulates three candidate rules for generating the \"Base Grid\" pattern. Each base grid pattern seems to correspond to logical AND, OR, or XOR on the 'separator' grid lines.  They try to link these operations to the shape of the colored pixels in the input. They hypothesize that the base pattern is created by applying an AND (intersection), OR (union), or XOR to the inputs, and begin to associate the AND, OR, and XOR base grids to input shapes. They test this hypothesis and verify that the 9-overlay pattern is constant in all the examples, so now the user has to figure out the output pattern for each grid.\n\nThey now know about the center box, and start to link an \"intersection\" operation to a \"+\", a \"union\" to a \"square\", and a \"XOR\" to an \"X.\" With this newly found rule, they have to figure out how to do this for the test input.\n\nThey then turn their focus to the test input. They note that the shape is a rectangle (4 disconnected points), and their task is to figure out which base grid (AND, OR, or XOR) the test pattern uses. By carefully comparing the output pattern to what they saw in the other examples, they start to reason on how to apply different color logic to create the target pattern. With a detailed review, they construct the output rules for each grid, and decide to use 'OR', 'OR' seems most logical to them.\n\nFinally, the user is ready to construct the test output grid for the given input parameters.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a $6 \\times 6$ input grid into a $16 \\times 16$ output grid based on the patterns observed in three examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n1.  **Structure:** The $16 \\times 16$ output grid can be viewed as a $5 \\times 5$ array of $2 \\times 2$ blocks, separated by single-pixel grid lines (separators).\n    -   Separator Rows are at indices: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n    -   Separator Columns are at indices: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n    -   Block Rows are at indices: (1,2), (4,5), (7,8), (10,11), (13,14).\n\n2.  **Base Pattern (Background):** The pattern of Orange (7) and Black (0) in the output grid varies by the color of the shape in the input.\n    -   **Example 1 (Green 3, Plus shape):** The pattern corresponds to **Blocks**. The grid is filled with 7s inside the blocks, while separators are 0.\n        -   Logic: Color is 7 if (Row is Block AND Col is Block).\n    -   **Example 2 (Blue 1, Square shape):** The pattern corresponds to **Vertical Lines**. The separators in the block rows are 7, while blocks are 0 and separator rows are 0.\n        -   Logic: Color is 7 if (Row is Block AND Col is Separator). (Note: This is equivalent to `!IsSep(Row) AND IsSep(Col)`).\n    -   **Example 3 (Magenta 6, X shape):** The pattern corresponds to an **XOR Grid**.\n        -   Logic: Color is 7 if (Row is Separator XOR Col is Separator).\n\n3.  **Inference for Test Input (Red 2, Rectangle shape):**\n    -   The logic follows color addition/combination rules often found in logic puzzles.\n    -   Blue (1) provides Vertical lines.\n    -   Magenta (6) is Blue (1) + Red (2) in additive color models (or XOR logic).\n    -   Since Magenta's pattern is $Vertical \\oplus Horizontal$, and we have Blue = Vertical, it implies **Red (2) = Horizontal Lines**.\n    -   Horizontal Line Logic: Color is 7 if (Row is Separator AND Col is Block).\n    -   This means Separator Rows (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15) will contain 7s at block columns and 0s at separator columns. Block Rows will be entirely 0.\n\n4.  **The Overlay (Maroon 9):**\n    -   In all examples, a fixed region around the center block (2,2) is highlighted with Maroon (9).\n    -   The region spans Rows 6-9 and Columns 5-10.\n    -   **Rule:** Inside this region, any pixel that is 0 in the Base Pattern becomes 9. Any pixel that is 7 remains 7.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Base Pattern (Horizontal Lines):**\n    *   **Separator Rows (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15):** The pattern is `0` at separators, `7` at blocks.\n        *   Sequence: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n    *   **Block Rows (All others):** All `0`s.\n\n*   **Overlay Application:**\n    *   Apply to Rows 6, 7, 8, 9; Columns 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n    *   **Rows 6 and 9 (Separator Rows):**\n        *   Original segment (cols 5-10): `7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7`\n        *   Apply Rule (0->9, 7->7): `7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7`\n        *   Full Row: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n    *   **Rows 7 and 8 (Block Rows):**\n        *   Original segment (cols 5-10): `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`\n        *   Apply Rule (0->9): `9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9`\n        *   Full Row: `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`\n\n*   **Resulting Grid Construction:**\n    *   Rows 0, 3, 12, 15: `0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n    *   Rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 13, 14: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n    *   Rows 6, 9: `0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n    *   Rows 7, 8: `0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into the ARC Task: Decoding the Visual Language**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to crack an ARC puzzle based on these three example inputs and corresponding outputs. My initial observation is that the inputs are all $6 \\times 6$ grids with a primary color (orange) and embedded patterns of other colors. The outputs, however, are $16 \\times 16$ and appear to be a tiling of smaller blocks.  The key is figuring out how the $6 \\times 6$ input maps to this $16 \\times 16$ output, and I'm suspecting it's not a direct scaling.\n\nI'm starting to think the $6 \\times 6$ grid defines the grid lines in the output, since the outputs always have a fixed $5 \\times 5$ grid structure with separators.  In Example 1, I noticed a 9-maroon box always appears surrounding the center block (2,2) on the output. So, I realize that it's important to find the logic that determines the pattern inside the $2\\times 2$ blocks. The trick is understanding that the input's special color determines what kind of pattern we're building.\n\nI see that the special color is related to the block pattern.  So, I start to analyze the patterns. In Example 1 (special color 3), all the blocks are solid, but in Example 2 (special color 1), there's a vertical-line pattern, and in Example 3 (special color 6), the blocks have a more mixed pattern. I'm hypothesizing the digit itself might be used to encode the pattern. For instance, the number of blocks could be determined by an alternating bit pattern.\n\nSo, I think about this: 1 is Vertical, 2 must be Horizontal, 3 must be Solid, and maybe 6 could include a pattern. I am interpreting a rule which I will use for the test input.\n\nThe rule:\n\n1.  Each special color has a pattern logic.\n2.  Rows are separated into sub patterns. The blocks are filled.\n3.  Each input in position $(r,c)$ must be checked. IF the input is the special color and it is not the center $(2,2)$, that block must be empty.\n4.  Then a Maroon Frame must be applied.\n\nNow I am going to try the Test Input.\nI'm expecting to make a horizontal-line pattern. I'm confident in this.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation rules are as follows:\n\n1.  **Output Grid Structure**: The input is a $6 \\times 6$ grid, but the output is always a $16 \\times 16$ grid. The output grid functions as a $5 \\times 5$ array of \"blocks\", where each block is $2 \\times 2$ pixels. These blocks are separated by 1-pixel wide grid lines (separators), which are initially black (0).\n\n2.  **Pattern Determination**: The content of the $2 \\times 2$ blocks is determined by the \"Special Color\" present in the input (the color that is not 7 or 0).\n    *   **Color 3 (Example 1)**: Maps to a **Solid** pattern (`7 7` on top, `7 7` on bottom).\n    *   **Color 1 (Example 2)**: Maps to **Vertical** patterns. The rows follow a sequence. Row 0 follows a cycle `Left, Right, Empty`, while Rows 1 and 2 are `Left`. Left is `7 0 / 7 0`, Right is `0 7 / 0 7`.\n    *   **Color 6 (Example 3)**: Maps to **Mixed** patterns involving Solid and Vertical.\n    *   **Color 2 (Test Input)**: Based on the relationship $1=\\text{Vertical}$, $3=\\text{Solid} (\\text{Vertical} + \\text{Horizontal})$, we infer that **2 = Horizontal**.\n        The Horizontal patterns are **Top** (`7 7 / 0 0`) and **Bottom** (`0 0 / 7 7`).\n        By analogy to Color 1 (Vertical), the rules for Color 2 (Horizontal) are:\n        *   **Row 0 (modulo 3)**: Cycle **Top, Bottom, Empty**. (Block indices: 0 $\\to$ T, 1 $\\to$ B, 2 $\\to$ E, 3 $\\to$ T, 4 $\\to$ B).\n        *   **Row 1 (modulo 3)**: All **Top**.\n        *   **Row 2 (modulo 3)**: All **Top**.\n\n3.  **Input Grid Influence**: The $6 \\times 6$ input grid acts as a mask.\n    *   If the input cell at $(r, c)$ contains the Special Color (2 in the test case), the corresponding output block $(r, c)$ is forced to be **Empty** (`0 0 / 0 0`).\n    *   **Exception**: The center block at $(2, 2)$ is exempt from this \"forced empty\" rule if it falls under the Maroon Frame (see below). In the test case, Input $(2,2)$ is 2, but we treat it as a normal pattern block before applying the frame.\n\n4.  **Maroon Frame**: A fixed feature in the output is a maroon (color 9) frame centered on block $(2, 2)$.\n    *   It overwrites the horizontal separators at rows 6 and 9 (columns 5-10).\n    *   It overwrites the vertical separators at columns 6 and 9 (rows 6-9).\n    *   Any black pixels (0) inside the frame (specifically within block $(2, 2)$) are turned to maroon (9).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Special Color**: 2 (Horizontal Patterns).\n*   **Input**: Contains 2s at $(0,2), (0,4), (2,2), (2,4)$.\n*   **Block Row 0 Patterns**: Cycle T, B, E, T, B.\n    *   Block (0,2) forced Empty by input. (Cycle was E, so stays E).\n    *   Block (0,4) forced Empty by input. (Cycle was B, becomes E).\n    *   Result: **T, B, E, T, E**.\n*   **Block Row 1 Patterns**: All T. Input row 1 has no 2s. Result: **All T**.\n*   **Block Row 2 Patterns**: All T.\n    *   Block (2,2): Input is 2, but it's the Center. Base pattern T (`7 7 / 0 0`). Inside frame, 0s become 9s $\\to$ `7 7 / 9 9`.\n    *   Block (2,4): Input is 2. Forced Empty.\n    *   Result: **T, T, T (modified), T, E**.\n*   **Block Row 3 Patterns**: Cycle T, B, E, T, B. Result: **T, B, E, T, E** (Same as Row 0).\n*   **Block Row 4 Patterns**: All T. Result: **All T** (Same as Row 1).\n\n**Constructing the Grid**:\n*   **T**: `7 7` / `0 0`\n*   **B**: `0 0` / `7 7`\n*   **E**: `0 0` / `0 0`\n\n*   **Row 0**: All 0s.\n*   **Row 1 (Block Row 0 Top)**: T, B, E, T, E $\\to$ `7 7`, `0 0`, `0 0`, `7 7`, `0 0` $\\to$ `0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0`\n*   **Row 2 (Block Row 0 Bot)**: `0 0`, `7 7`, `0 0`, `0 0`, `0 0` $\\to$ `0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n*   **Row 3**: All 0s.\n*   **Row 4 (Block Row 1 Top)**: All T $\\to$ `7 7`s $\\to$ `0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n*   **Row 5 (Block Row 1 Bot)**: All T $\\to$ `0 0`s $\\to$ All 0s.\n*   **Row 6**: Frame Top $\\to$ `0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0`\n*   **Row 7 (Block Row 2 Top)**: All T.

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation from a 6x6 input to a 16x16 output.\n\n**Key observations:**\n\n1. **Base tile pattern**: The output is a 16x16 grid made up of repeating 3x3 tiles. The tile pattern depends on the shape in the input.\n\n2. **Tile determination rule**: Looking at the 3x3 shape region in the input:\n   - If position (0,0) of the shape has the background color (7), the tile has 7s in positions where both row > 0 AND column > 0\n   - If position (0,0) is colored AND (1,0) is not colored, then tile row 0 has 7s at columns > 0, and column 0 has 7s at rows > 0\n   - If position (0,0) is colored AND (1,0) is also colored, only column 0 has 7s at rows > 0\n\n3. **9s placement**: In the center region (rows 5-10, cols 5-10), the original shape pattern is replicated in a 2x2 arrangement (6x6 total) with the colored values replaced by 9.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n```\n7,7,2,7,2,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,2,7,2,7\n...\n```\n\nThe 3x3 shape (at rows 0-2, cols 2-4) is:\n```\nX.X    (2,7,2)\n...    (7,7,7)\nX.X    (2,7,2)\n```\n\n- Position (0,0) is colored (X)\n- Position (1,0) is NOT colored (.)\n\nSo the tile pattern is:\n```\n0,7,7\n7,0,0\n7,0,0\n```\n\nThe 2x2 tiling of the shape creates 9s at:\n- Row 0,2,3,5 (relative) \u2192 Rows 5,7,8,10 (output) at columns 5,7,8,10\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation:\n\n1. **Output size**: The 6x6 input becomes a 16x16 output.\n\n2. **Base pattern structure**: The output has a grid structure with dividers at positions 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 (for both rows and columns). This creates a 5x5 grid of 2x2 cells separated by single-pixel dividers.\n\n3. **Base pattern determination**: The pattern of 0s and 7s is determined by the input shape's characteristics:\n   - **Divider intersection** (row & col both dividers): always 0\n   - **Divider row / cell columns**: 0 if left/right edge midpoints are filled, 7 if empty\n   - **Cell rows / divider columns**: 0 if top/bottom edge midpoints are filled, 7 if empty\n   - **Cell interior**: 7 if corners are empty, 0 if corners are filled\n\n4. **Shape overlay**: The input shape (3x3) is tiled 2x2 in the center of the output (rows 5-10, cols 5-10), with filled cells marked as 9 and empty cells keeping the base value.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- Shape is at rows 0-2, cols 2-4: `X.X / ... / X.X` (four corners of a 3x3)\n- Corners: filled\n- Top/bottom midpoints: empty\n- Left/right midpoints: empty\n- Center: empty\n\n**Base pattern rules for test:**\n- Divider row/cell col: 7 (L/R empty)\n- Cell row/divider col: 7 (T/B empty)  \n- Cell interior: 0 (corners filled)\n\nThis gives tile pattern: `0,7,7 / 7,0,0 / 7,0,0` (same as Example 3)\n\n**Shape tiled 2x2**: `X.XX.X / ...... / X.XX.X / X.XX.X / ...... / X.XX.X`\n\nPlacing 9s at X positions and keeping base values elsewhere:\n\n```\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n```",

The output is always **16\u00d716**, and behaves like a **3-periodic grid** (because `16 = 3*(6\u22121)+1`).  \n   So we can classify output cells by `(row mod 3, col mod 3)`:\n   - `(0,0)` = grid **vertex**\n   - `(0,\u22600)` = **horizontal edge**\n   - `(\u22600,0)` = **vertical edge**\n   - `(\u22600,\u22600)` = **face/interior**\n4. The stencil controls a **background pattern** in the 16\u00d716 output using color `7` vs `0`:\n   - If the stencil\u2019s **center** is background \u2192 fill **vertices** with `7`.\n   - If the stencil\u2019s **top or bottom middle** is background \u2192 fill **vertical edges** with `7`.\n   - If the stencil\u2019s **left or right middle** is background \u2192 fill **horizontal edges** with `7`.\n   - If any stencil **corner** is background \u2192 fill **faces** with `7`.\n   - Everything else is `0`.\n5. Separately, the stencil itself is turned into a **6\u00d76 motif** by **tiling it 2\u00d72**, recoloring:\n   - original foreground color \u2192 `9`\n   - original background (`7`) stays `7`  \n   This 6\u00d76 motif is pasted into the **center** of the 16\u00d716 (rows 6\u201311, cols 6\u201311 in 1-based indexing).\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\nForeground color is `2`. Its bounding box is rows 1\u20133, cols 3\u20135, giving the 3\u00d73 stencil:\n\n```\n2 7 2\n7 7 7\n2 7 2\n```\n\nSo background (`7`) occurs at:\n- center \u2192 **yes** \u21d2 vertices are `7`\n- all four edge-centers \u2192 **yes** \u21d2 both horizontal and vertical edges are `7`\n- corners \u2192 **no** (corners are foreground) \u21d2 faces remain `0`\n\nThen we tile this stencil 2\u00d72, recoloring `2\u21929`, to form the centered 6\u00d76 motif:\n\nRow pattern for corners-only: `9 7 9 9 7 9`, with middle rows all `7`.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7",

Look at the **four side-middle cells** of that 3\u00d73 box:\n\n- **Left-middle & right-middle** (middle row, left/right positions)\n  - If both are **7**, the output draws **horizontal grid lines** (rows 1,4,7,10,13,16) in color **7**.\n  - Otherwise, those horizontal grid-line rows remain **0**.\n\n- **Top-middle & bottom-middle** (top/bottom positions of the middle column)\n  - If both are **7**, the output draws **vertical grid lines** (cols 1,4,7,10,13,16) in color **7**.\n  - Otherwise, those vertical grid-line cols remain **0**.\n\nCell interiors:\n- If **no** horizontal and **no** vertical lines are drawn, interiors are filled with **7** (Example 1).\n- Otherwise interiors remain **0** (Examples 2 & 3).\n\n**3) A fixed centered 6\u00d76 square of 9 is added**\nFinally, the output places a centered **6\u00d76** block (rows **6\u201311**, cols **6\u201311**) of color **9**, **but it does not overwrite any 7** already present (so existing 7 grid lines \u201cpunch holes\u201d through the 9 area).\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\nTest input\u2019s non-7 cells (color 2) lie in the 3\u00d73 box (rows 1\u20133, cols 3\u20135):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{matrix}\n2 & 7 & 2\\\\\n7 & 7 & 7\\\\\n2 & 7 & 2\n\\end{matrix}\n\\]\n\nSide-middles are all **7**:\n- left-middle = 7, right-middle = 7 \u21d2 **horizontal grid lines ON**\n- top-middle = 7, bottom-middle = 7 \u21d2 **vertical grid lines ON**\nSo the base is the **full grid** (like Example 3), with interior 0, then overlay the centered 6\u00d76 of 9 without overwriting 7.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid (16\u00d716)\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### 1) What the examples show\n\nEach input is a 6\u00d76 grid with background color **7** and a small 3\u00d73 \u201csymbol\u201d made from the other color (3 / 1 / 6).  \nThe output is always **16\u00d716**, and it is built from two parts:\n\n#### A. A 16\u00d716 background \u201clattice\u201d made from colors 0 and 7\nThis lattice has a period of 3 in both directions (rows/cols 0,3,6,9,12,15 are the \u201cgridlines\u201d):\n\n- Cells where **row%3==0 and col%3==0** (grid intersections) are always **0**.\n- Whether the *horizontal gridline segments* (row%3==0, col%3!=0) are **7** or **0** depends on the cropped 3\u00d73 symbol:\n  - If the **middle row** of the 3\u00d73 crop is *fully non-background*, then these segments are **0**.\n  - Otherwise, they are **7**.\n- Whether the *vertical gridline segments* (col%3==0, row%3!=0) are **7** or **0** depends similarly on the crop:\n  - If the **middle column** of the 3\u00d73 crop is *fully non-background*, then these segments are **0**.\n  - Otherwise, they are **7**.\n- The *cell interiors* (row%3!=0 and col%3!=0) are **7** only when the **middle column is full**; otherwise they are **0**.\n\nThis exactly matches:\n- Example1 (middle row full, middle column full) \u2192 only interiors are 7, gridlines are 0.\n- Example2 (middle row full, middle column not full) \u2192 only vertical gridlines are 7.\n- Example3 (middle row not full, middle column not full) \u2192 both horizontal+vertical gridlines are 7, interiors are 0.\n\n#### B. A centered 6\u00d76 \u201cstamp\u201d of 9s\n1. Take the **bounding box of all non-7 cells** in the input. In the examples it is 3\u00d73.\n2. Make a 6\u00d76 by **tiling that 3\u00d73 crop 2\u00d72**.\n3. Wherever the tiled pattern corresponds to a non-background cell, paint **9** on the output.\n4. This 6\u00d76 is placed **centered** in the 16\u00d716 output, i.e. its top-left corner is at **(row 5, col 5)** (so it occupies rows 5\u201310 and cols 5\u201310).\n\n---\n\n### 2) Apply to the test input\n\n**Test input non-7 color:** 2.  \nBounding box of 2s is rows 0\u20132 and cols 2\u20134, giving this 3\u00d73 crop:\n\n```\n2 7 2\n7 7 7\n2 7 2\n```\n\n- Middle row is all 7 \u2192 **not full** \u2192 horizontal gridline segments are **7**.\n- Middle column is all 7 \u2192 **not full** \u2192 vertical gridline segments are **7**.\n- Therefore the base lattice is the same type as Example3: gridlines are 7, interiors are 0 (intersections are 0).\n\nNow tile the 3\u00d73 crop 2\u00d72 to get the 6\u00d76 mask of where to place 9s (only the corners of each 3\u00d73 tile). Overlay those 9s into rows 5\u201310, cols 5\u201310.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid (16\u00d716)\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand how the input transforms to the output.\n\n**Analysis of the transformation:**\n\n1. **Output size**: The output is always 16x16 regardless of the 6x6 input.\n\n2. **Base tile pattern**: The output has a repeating 3x3 tile pattern determined by the input shape's configuration. Looking at which positions in the shape (mod 3) are colored:\n   - Position (0,0) in the tile is always 0\n   - Positions (0,1), (0,2) are 0 if shape position (1,0) is colored, else 7\n   - Positions (1,0), (2,0) are 0 if shape position (0,1) is colored, else 7\n   - Interior positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) are 7 if BOTH shape positions (0,1) and (1,0) are colored, else 0\n\n3. **Center overlay**: In the center region (rows 5-10, cols 5-10), where the shape's colored positions (tiled 2x2) would appear, 0s are replaced with 9s.\n\n**Applying to test input:**\n```\n7,7,2,7,2,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,2,7,2,7\n...\n```\n\nThe shape is at rows 0-2, cols 2-4. Within this 3x3 box:\n```\nC . C\n. . .\nC . C\n```\n(4 corners colored)\n\n- Shape (0,1) = NOT colored\n- Shape (1,0) = NOT colored\n\nSo the tile pattern is:\n```\n0 7 7\n7 0 0\n7 0 0\n```\n\nFor the center region, shape colored positions are (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). These positions (when mapped mod 3) get 9s in the center.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n```",

The specific pattern depends on where 7s appear in the input's shape region:\n   - Example 1: 7s at corners \u2192 Background has 7 where (r%3\u22600 AND c%3\u22600)\n   - Example 2: 7s at top/bottom centers \u2192 Background has 7 where (r%3\u22600 AND c%3=0)  \n   - Example 3: 7s at all edge centers \u2192 Background has 7 where (r%3=0 XOR c%3=0)\n\n3. **Pattern placement**: The colored shape from the input is converted to 9s and placed in a 2x2 tiled arrangement in the center (rows 5-10, cols 5-10).\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n```\n7,7,2,7,2,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,2,7,2,7\n```\n\nThe pattern is in rows 0-2, cols 2-4:\n```\n2,7,2\n7,7,7\n2,7,2\n```\n\nThe 2s (colored cells) are at corners: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)\nThe 7s are at: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1) - a plus shape including all edge centers\n\nSince 7s include all edge centers (similar to Example 3), the background uses the XOR pattern: 7 where (r%3=0 XOR c%3=0).\n\nThe pattern converted to 9s:\n```\n9,7,9\n7,7,7\n9,7,9\n```\n\nThis gets tiled 2x2 in the center region.\n\n```\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n```",
