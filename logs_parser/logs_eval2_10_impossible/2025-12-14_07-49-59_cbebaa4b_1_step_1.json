        "Full raw LLM response": "**Problem Breakdown and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The task seems to be about rearranging objects within a grid. The input consists of various colored shapes, scattered on a black background. These shapes are formed by connected pixels, sometimes with \"hooks\" or connectors made of red pixels. The goal is to produce an output grid where these shapes are re-arranged, potentially forming a larger, interconnected structure.  Let's call these entities \"parts\" consisting of a colored shape and their adjacent connectors.\n\n**Key Observations and Hypotheses:**\n\n1.  **Object Structure:** The shapes appear to be composed of lines of colored pixels, sometimes enclosing areas and sometimes being open. They seem to have connectors, usually made of Red (2) pixels.  These \"connectors\" are the key. They define how the parts are assembled.\n2.  **Assembly Rule:**  The output seems to represent some kind of \"connected\" or \"hanging\" structure. There's a strong visual similarity between the red connectors in the input and output. The parts are connected by matching connectors. The distance between those connectors determines how to join the shapes.\n3.  **Root/Base:** There is a base or a starting point, which might be a fixed position or a specific shape in the input. In the Examples, it seems the structure is aligned in such a way that it is in the center, or top of the Grid.\n4.  **Matching Ports:** Connectors act as ports. The position of these ports is crucial to assembling the shapes. I need to figure out what type of port can join what.\n    *   **Vertical connections:**  Top (S) to Bottom(N).\n    *   **Horizontal connections:** Side to side (E-W).\n    *   Shape ports must match to combine.\n    *   They might involve connecting a shape's connector to an adjacent part.\n5.  **Algorithm**\n    1.  Parse the input grid to identify all \"parts\" which are non-black connected colored pixels and their nearby connectors.  Identify the location, color, and structure of each part.\n    2.  For each part, identify its ports (Red pixels).\n    3.  Define the port signature. Direction (North, South, East, West). The pattern.\n    4.  Build an adjacency graph. Connect those that have matching signatures.\n    5.  Assemble the parts using the graph and matching ports. The root or some shape will start in a specific location. Then add the others.\n    6.  Final arrangement. Ensure it is inside of the grid.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input**\n\nI'll now apply this logic to the provided test input. First, I'll extract all of the parts and their connectors from the input grid. I'll need to figure out how to match them, construct a graph (how they connect, how far, what size ports match what). Finally, I will place the assembled structure in the correct position in the output grid and output the grid.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples and the test input, the task involves reconstructing a \"hanging mobile\" structure. The input contains several disjoint components (colored shapes) with red pixels acting as \"connectors\" or \"ports\". We must identify the connectivity graph based on matching connector patterns (width, relative position) and assemble the components into a single coherent structure in the output grid.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Identify Components:**\n    *   **Maroon (9):** Input rows 6-9, cols 3-7. Connectors: Bottom Left (dist 2 from left), Bottom Right (dist 4).\n    *   **Green (3):** Input rows 20-23, cols 1-6. Connectors: Top Right (dist 3), Top Far Right (dist 5), Bottom (dist 2 & 5).\n    *   **Teal-Small (8):** Input rows 1-3, cols 10-12. Connectors: Top (dist 0 & 2).\n    *   **Yellow (4):** Input rows 11-15, cols 9-13. Connectors: Left (dist -1 from shape), Top, Bottom.\n    *   **Blue (1):** Input rows 10-13, cols 18-23. Connectors: Top (dist 1 & 4 from left), Bottom (dist 0 & 5).\n    *   **Orange (7):** Input rows 21, cols 12-17. Connectors: Top Left, Top Right (dist 5).\n    *   **Teal-Large (8):** Input rows 1-4, cols 16-22.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to solve an ARC task based on two examples and a test input. It looks like it's a visual puzzle of some sort. The goal seems to be to reorganize a scene composed of colored shapes and outlines. There are some key elements: \"objects\" (which are shapes outlined or filled with colors), \"connectors\" (red pixels), and a sense of stacking or arrangement.  I need to figure out the rules of this arrangement.\n\n**Analysis of Example 1:**\n\nLet's break down Example 1. I see different shapes, some like open containers and some like solid blocks.  There is a clear \"before\" and \"after\" scenario, meaning an input configuration and a target layout. The red pixels are critical.  They appear to \"connect\" the objects. My first hypothesis is that the red pixels function as attachment points, but I'll need to figure out exactly how. The layout is somewhat a \"tetris\" style, with objects being positioned next to or on top of each other. I note that objects at the top-right in the input are now in the middle of the stack.\n\nI'm starting to formalize:\n1.  **Identify Objects:**  Look for solid colored/outlined shapes.\n2.  **Red Pixels are Connectors:** They're attached to the shapes in specific patterns.\n3.  **Find the Connection Rule:** This is the core. Can I link objects based on red pixel configuration? The output objects must be built out of the objects from the input.\n\n**Connection Discovery and Hypothesis Formulation:**\n\nNow I'm looking closer at the red pixels on a per object basis. I'm calling a shape plus its attached red pixels a \"unit.\" This unit appears to be the fundamental building block.  My current thought is that red pixels function like \"plugs\" and \"sockets.\" Where they meet, that's where an object stacks. In other words, red is a joint or connector. I begin to define, for instance, a \"Cyan Unit\" as an upright-U with red at the top.\n\n**Example 1 Pattern Matching:**\n\nI'm carefully studying how these units connect in Example 1. It looks like a tree or a chain. The way this construction occurs might be \"Chemistry-like\" or Lego-like - a piece with a certain connection on the bottom can link with a connector on a top piece. I start tracing how one object sits on another. I check distances and how the pieces line up.\n\n**Connector Type and Spatial Relationship Validation:**\n\nI start a systematic analysis of the red pixels and the shapes, looking at each object in Input and Output, including their location and shape relative to others. The object shapes, sizes and connector positions are logged, and any \"match\" or \"mismatch\" is documented with detailed notes.\n\n**Refining the Rules based on Connector Patterns:**\n\nHere, I'm forming connection rules:\n-   **Vertical Connection:** Top-red pixels attach to bottom-red pixels\n-   **Horizontal Connection:** Right to left\n-   **Directionality matters, not just spacing.**\nIt's looking like the red pixels are critical and that their pattern is what is critical. I'm beginning to test the idea that red pixels are like \"sockets\" to fit into each other.\n\n**Example 2 Validation:**\n\nExample 2 should validate these connection rules. Again I identify objects, look at connector positions and verify. I begin to check my logic, object by object and looking at connector configurations.\n\n**Object parsing becomes precise and complete:**\n\nI'm taking each element of the input and documenting all color information with connector points and trying to fully create a picture of a single object by combining various color and connector patterns.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\n\nNow it's time for the Test Input. It's time to follow all these steps and see if the rules work for this new puzzle. I must identify all objects.\n\n**Final Attempt at Building the Test Output:**\nFinally, I try assembling the Test Input. I'm looking at objects, connectors, and what fits where. I will build an arrangement that has all pieces touching.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a scene by rearranging scattered objects. Based on the solved examples, the logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains several distinct \"objects\" composed of colored pixels (excluding 0 for background and 2 for connectors). Each object is a contiguous shape (like a block, a U-shape, or a bar).\n2.  **Identify Connectors:** Red pixels (value 2) are adjacent to specific points on the objects. These act as \"connectors\" or \"snaps\".\n3.  **Determine Connections:** Objects are assembled into a single structure based on matching these connectors.\n    *   **Vertical Stacking:** An object with connectors on its bottom edge sits on top of an object with connectors on its top edge. The connectors typically align.\n    *   **Horizontal Attachment:** An object with connectors on its right side attaches to the left side of another object, and vice versa.\n    *   The red pixels (2s) are preserved in the final output at the interface between objects.\n4.  **Transformation:** All objects are moved to the bottom of the grid, forming a connected structure rooted at the base. The relative positions of objects are determined by the connector logic.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Objects Analysis:**\n    *   **Orange (7):** A bar of width 6 at the bottom. It has red connectors on top corners. This is the **base**.\n    *   **Blue (1):** A U-shape of width 6. It has red connectors at the bottom corners (matching Orange) and connectors on the top rim.\n    *   **Yellow (4):** A solid 5x5 block (approx). It has a red connector on the right (matches Blue's left) and left (matches Green).\n    *   **Green (3):** A U-shape/box of width 6. It has a red connector on the right (matches Yellow).\n    *   **Cyan-Right (8):** A large inverted U-shape (width 7). It has a red connector on the left (matches Blue's right).\n    *   **Maroon (9):** An inverted U-shape (width 5).

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I see the problem:**\n\nThe user wants me to solve an ARC task that's a bit like a puzzle.  They give me two examples and a test input and expect me to figure out a rule to transform the input into an output grid.  I think the task is about finding some objects in the grid and rearranging them based on a set of rules.\n\n**Here's my thought process:**\n\n1.  **First Look:** I examine the examples to understand what's going on. The input seems to have these colored shapes that look like they are \"hanging\" from something. I notice red pixels (color 2) that are key to the connection or a structural element. I'm going to call them \"hooks\" for now. The output is a rearrangement, but the size of the grid stays the same.\n\n2.  **Object Analysis:**  I start to look closer at the example. I see there are different objects made up of colored pixels (like yellow, cyan, blue etc.), and it's important to know the shape. But I realize that there is a pattern to the red pixels or hooks - they seems to be holding these things in place.  I have to look carefully to find the shapes by finding the different colors and finding the boundaries.\n\n3.  **Output Exploration:** I want to find the rule of the transformation.  The shapes are still there, but they are rearranged at the bottom. It looks like it could be a gravity or stacking problem.  Let's look more closely at the position of the shapes in the output. I also realized that the Red pixels are always part of the shapes, and I have to remember that.\n\n4.  **Hypothesis: The Mobile Theory.** I'm going to look for a kind of \"Mobile\" type problem where pieces are connected. The \"hooks\" (red pixels) are the connection points, and I start to think that objects are attached to each other. They're like a chain of objects.\n    -   I can start to predict the order based on their \"sockets\".\n\n5.  **Let's check example 2**. Time to analyze example 2. I need to be more precise about how the hooks work. The key is in the red pixels.\n    -   I decide to treat these Red hooks as \"Plugs\" and \"Sockets\" where they need to fit a kind of key.\n\n6.  **Re-analyze Hook Properties:**\n    -   An object can have two types of connectors based on how the pixels are arranged, \"Plugs\" that point upwards and \"Sockets\" that point downwards.\n    -   I have to find all the Objects.\n    -   I have to figure out how the objects are connected to each other.\n    -   I will check Example 1 Input and make sure all is right.\n\n7.  **Connectivity and Tree Structure.**  I'm going to reconstruct the \"Tree\" or chain of objects based on Plugs and Sockets.\n    -   \"Sockets\" and \"Plugs\" that match get connected.\n    -   Output: The \"roots\" that don't have parents go at the top, and the chain extends downwards.\n    -   I realize all is about \"Hook-Matching\".\n\n8.  **Example 1 Graph:**\n    -   I carefully map how each object's hook works - Cyan, Blue, Yellow, Grey, and Green.\n\n9.  **Connectivity Hypothesis:** Based on the Plugs and Sockets I see how the connections are supposed to work.\n    -   I see it fits perfectly - object-by-object.\n    -   Now I can see how things stack up in the output.\n\n10. **Example 1 Structure:**\n    -   Green is the root - it is the TOP most thing.\n    -   Cyan is below, hanging from Green.\n    -   Yellow is below Cyan.\n    -   Blue is connected to yellow, at the side.\n    -   Grey is the last guy, hanging on Blue.\n\n11. **Verify with Example 2** Now it's time to check this works.\n    -   I trace through the same steps, this time looking at the Pink and Yellow objects.\n    -   I test how the connections are made using \"Plugs\" and \"Sockets\".\n\n12. **Connections Ex 2:**\n    -   I keep identifying the roots (Pink/Cyan in this case).\n    -   I see if anything matches each other, based on their position and \"Hooks\".\n\n13. **Building Blocks**.\n    -   By now, the puzzle is solved.\n    -   I re-read the rules and the structure.\n    -   It's a structure with roots at the top (no parent objects)\n    \n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the problem asks to reassemble a set of scattered objects into a coherent structure. The objects are \"hanging\" or connected via red pixels (value 2), which act as \"hooks\" or \"connectors\".\n\n**Rules for assembly:**\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Each distinct colored shape (including attached red '2's) is an object.\n2.  **Identify Connectors:**\n    *   **Top Plugs:** Upward-facing or top-edge `2`s. These connect to a parent's bottom socket.\n    *   **Bottom Sockets:** Downward-facing or bottom-edge `2`s. These connect to a child's top plug.\n    *   **Side Connectors:** `2`s on the side.\n3.  **Determine Hierarchy:** Match sockets and plugs based on their pattern (e.g., single pixel, two pixels with a gap of 1, etc.).\n    *   A single socket matches a single plug.\n    *   A pair of sockets with gap $N$ matches a pair of plugs with gap $N$.\n4.  **Layout:**\n    *   **Roots:** Objects with no parent (no matching top plug) are placed at the top (starting at Row 4).\n    *   **Children:** Placed directly below their parents such that the connecting `2`s overlap (sharing the same row).\n    *   **Spacing:** Maintain the relative geometry of the objects.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nWe identified two distinct trees:\n\n**Tree 1 (Left):**\n*   **Root:** Maroon Object (Obj 2).\n    *   Position: Row 4, centered around Column 4.\n    *   Shape: `9`s block.\n    *   Bottom Sockets: `2 0 2` (Gap 1) at Row 8, Cols 4 & 6.\n*   **Child:** Cyan Object Left (Obj 1L).\n    *   Top Plugs: `2 0 2` (Gap 1). Matches Maroon Sockets.\n    *   Position: Hanging from Row 8.\n\n**Tree 2 (Right):**\n*   **Root:** Cyan Object Right (Obj 1R).\n    *   Position: Row 4, centered around Column 12.\n    *   Shape: Rectangular frame of `8`s.\n    *   Sockets:\n        *   `2` at Row 6, Col 9 (Left side).\n        *   `2` at Row 7, Col 14 (Right side).\n*   **Child 1:** Yellow Object (Obj 4).\n    *   Top Plug: Single `2`. Matches Cyan Left Socket (Row 6, Col 9).\n    *   Position: Hanging from Row 6.\n    *   Socket: Side `2` at Row 10, Col 8.\n*   **Child 1.1:** Green Object (Obj 5).\n    *   Top Plug: Single `2`. Matches Yellow Side Socket (Row 10, Col 8).\n    *   Position: Hanging from Row 10.\n    *   Socket: `2 0 0 2` (Gap 2) at Row 15, Cols 6 & 9.\n*   **Child 1.1.1:** Blue Object (Obj 3).\n    *   Top Plugs: `2 0 0 2`. Matches Green Sockets.\n    *   Position: Hanging from Row 15.\n*   **Child 2:** Orange Object (Obj 6).\n    *   Top Plug: Single `2`. Matches Cyan Right Socket (Row 7, Col 14).\n    *   Position: Hanging from Row 7.\n\n**Final Coordinates (Col indices 0-based):**\n*   **Maroon:** Cols 2-6, Rows 4-7.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this task:**\n\nI'm being asked to solve an ARC (Abstract Reasoning Challenge) problem. The input is a 2D grid of numbers, where each number represents a color. The goal is to figure out the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. I'm given two examples and a test input. I need to figure out the transformation rule and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Understanding the Input and Output:**\nThe input and output are 2D grids, and I need to identify the transformation rule applied to the input grid to obtain the output grid. The numbers inside the grid represent colors. The challenge is in understanding how the objects within the input are rearranged in the output. The rule might involve object identification, relative positions, rotations, or some other operation. The grid sizes, in examples, are 22x22.\n\n**Initial Analysis of Example 1:**\nI'm starting by analyzing the input and output grids of the first example. First, I'm observing the grid structure: the sizes (22x22) and the content which appears to be distinct objects against a background of '0' (background). I'm looking for distinct shapes or objects that form from the unique numbers, and the relative positions of the distinct shapes within the input grid. I've noted down the following shapes:\n\n*   A large background of 0s.\n*   Several objects formed by other numbers (colors).\n*   Shape 8 (teal) at top right with some 2s (red). This appears to be a hollow rectangle.\n*   Shape 1 (blue) at middle left with a U shape and 2s nearby.\n*   Shape 4 (yellow) at the middle, a 3x3 block with red pixels.\n*   Shape 3 (green) at bottom left with 2s.\n*   Shape 5 (gray) at bottom right, a line shape with 2s.\n\n**Relationship Between Input and Output:**\nNow I'm looking at how these shapes are arranged in the output grid. It seems that the shapes are rearranged, but there must be a rule. I have observed the following relationship.\n\n*   The shapes are stacked vertically in the output.\n*   Their positions seem linked to the count of the red pixels (2s) next to each shape in the input, possibly their original positions, or sizes.\n*   In the output, the shapes appear to have specific arrangements based on some relationships to their input.\n\n**Looking for the Connection Rule (The Key!):**\nI've started counting the red pixels ('2s') next to each object and checking for the correlation, since the example grids suggest some objects have 2s, which may act as connection points. The 2s seem to be \"hooks\" or specific markers on the objects. I try to establish a correspondence between the position of these 2s in the input and the arrangement in the output. Specifically, I started analyzing each shape's 2s:\n\n*   **Shape 3:** The 2s seem to be at the tips of a U-shape at the bottom of the shape.\n*   **Shape 8:** The 2s are above the top corners of the shape.\n*   **Shape 1:** The 2s seem to be at a box.\n*   Looking at the overall arrangement, it looks as if these pieces are assembled. They connect by matching their connectors.\n\n**Re-Evaluating the Connection Logic:**\nI can see that the shapes act like puzzle pieces, and the '2s' are the connection points, or \"puzzle tabs.\" The shapes have 2s on their boundaries. If a shape has 2s at the bottom, then it is connected to a shape that has 2s at the top. This would create a tower of shapes in the output.\n\n**Tracing Movement:**\nI look at the positions of the shapes and the positions of the 2s, and the arrangement becomes evident. The 2s seem to connect to each other across shapes, creating a puzzle. I trace where the shapes start and end, and the 2s in one shape are touching 2s in another shape.\n\n*   Shape 3's 2s (at the bottom) appear to connect to Shape 8 (having 2s at the top).\n\n**Refined Hypothesis:**\nIn this scenario, I've realized that the 2s act as connection points. The shapes are assembled such that the 2s overlap in the output (the puzzle pieces snap together). This looks like the main clue. The 2s are shared between the shapes that touch. This matching of connectors is the rule.\n\n**Verifying with Example 2:**\nI analyze the second example, applying the same\n\nThe user wants me to solve the ARC task \"Structure Construction from Parts\".\n\n**Rule Inference:**\n1.  **Identify Parts:** The input contains several distinct shapes (colors other than 0 and 2).\n2.  **Identify Connectors:** Each shape has associated '2's (red pixels) adjacent to it. These '2's act as connection points or \"ports\".\n3.  **Determine Topology:** The goal is to assemble the parts into a single coherent structure. The assembly is governed by matching the connectors.\n    *   A '2' on one shape must overlap with a '2' on another shape.\n    *   The spatial arrangement (spacing and orientation) of the '2's must match.\n    *   For example, a shape with two '2's on the bottom separated by 3 spaces will connect to a shape with two '2's on the top separated by 3 spaces.\n    *   Vertical connectors (a column of '2's) connect to other vertical connectors.\n4.  **Assembly:** Translate each shape (rigid body transformation) so that its connectors overlap with the matching connectors of the adjacent shapes.\n5.  **Output:** The result is the assembled structure centered in the grid.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Shapes and Connectors:**\n    *   **S3 (Yellow 9s):** Located at top-left.\n        *   Bottom Connectors: Three horizontal '2's with gap 1 (indices 5, 7, 9 relative to row).\n    *   **S7 (Green 3s):** Located at bottom-left.\n        *   Bottom Connectors: Two horizontal '2's with gap 2 (indices 2, 5).\n        *   Note: S7 also has Right diagonal connectors, but we found a better match for its bottom.\n    *   **S1 (Teal Small 8s):** Located at top-middle.\n        *   Top Connectors: Two horizontal '2's with gap 1. Matches S3's bottom ports (subset).\n        *   Right Connector: Single '2' at (3,16).\n    *   **S2 (Teal Big 8s):** Located at top-right.\n        *   Left Connector: Single '2' at (3,16). Matches S1.\n        *   Bottom Connectors: Two vertical '2's at cols 21, 21 (rows 4, 5).\n    *   **S5 (Blue 1s):** Located at middle-right.\n        *   Top Connectors: Two horizontal '2's with gap 2. Matches S7 Bottom.\n        *   Right Connectors: Two vertical '2's at cols 23, 23 (rows 14, 15).\n    *   **S4 (Yellow 4s):** Located at middle-center.\n        *   Right Connectors: Two vertical '2's at cols 14, 14 (rows 10, 11). Matches S2 Bottom.\n        *   Left Connectors: Two vertical '2's at cols 8, 8 (rows 14, 15). Matches S5 Right.\n    *   **S6 (Orange 7s):** Located at bottom-middle.\n        *   Top Connectors: Two horizontal '2's with gap 4.\n        *   S5 Bottom Connectors (rows 14, 14 at 18, 23) have gap 4. Matches S6 Top.\n\n2.  **Determine Assembly Chain:**\n    *   **S3** sits on **S1**. (S3 Bottom matches S1 Top).\n    *   **S1** connects to **S2**.

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to analyze how shapes assemble around the central 4-block based on the \"2\" markers as connection points.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1. The 4-filled block acts as the anchor/center\n2. Other colored shapes have \"2\" markers at their edges indicating connection points\n3. Shapes are assembled around the 4-block by aligning their \"2\" markers\n4. The \"2\"s serve as connectors between shapes\n\n**Identifying shapes in test input:**\n- 4-block: rows 11-14, cols 9-13 (anchor)\n- 9-shape: rows 6-10, cols 3-7 (connects via 2s at bottom)\n- 1-shape: rows 9-14, cols 18-23 (connects via 2s at corners)\n- Small 8-shape: rows 1-3, cols 10-12 (connects via 2s at top)\n- Large 8-shape: rows 0-4, cols 16-23 (connects via 2s at edges)\n- 3-shape: rows 20-24, cols 1-6 (connects via 2s)\n- 7-shape: rows 20-21, cols 12-17 (connects via 2s above)\n\n**Assembly logic:**\n- 9-shape shifts right to connect at (10,9)\n- 1-shape shifts left/up to connect at (11,14)\n- 7-shape shifts up to connect at (15,10)\n- Large 8-shape connects to 1-shape's right edge at (6,18)\n- 3-shape connects to 9-shape's left at (8,5)\n- Small 8-shape positions above 4-block\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n0,3,3,3,2,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,8,0\n0,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,2,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,3,2,9,9,9,8,0,8,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,0,2,8,8,8,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n- The grids contain several **separate \u201cpieces\u201d** (connected components of non\u2011zero cells).\n- Color **2** cells act like **connector pins**.\n- The piece containing the solid **4** block is the **base**: it stays **fixed in place**.\n- All other pieces are moved by **translation only** (no rotation) so that **pairs of 2\u2011pins overlap** between pieces.\n  - Each connection uses **two pins**: if two pins in piece X have the same relative offset as two pins in piece Y, then X can be shifted so those two pins land exactly on Y\u2019s two pins.\n- After assembling, everything else becomes background **0**.\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n1. **Identify the base**: the large 4-rectangle (rows 11\u201314, cols 9\u201313) plus its attached 2-pins at  \n   (10,9), (11,14), (14,8), (15,10).  \n   These pins form two connection-pairs with vectors:\n   - (10,9) \u2192 (11,14) is **(1,5)**\n   - (14,8) \u2192 (15,10) is **(1,2)**\n\n2. **Match and attach the other pieces by equal pin-pair vectors**:\n\n   **Branch 1 (via (1,2), then (0,3), then (0,5))**\n   - The **3-piece** has pins (20,4)\u2192(21,6) = (1,2).  \n     Translate it so (20,4)\u2192(14,8): **shift (-6,+4)**.\n   - That 3-piece then exposes pins with vector (0,3), matching the **1-piece** top pins (0,3).  \n     Translate the 1-piece so its top pins overlap: **shift (+9,-13)**.\n   - The 1-piece bottom pins have vector (0,5), matching the **7-bar** pins (0,5).  \n     Translate the 7-bar: **shift (+3,-7)**.\n\n   **Branch 2 (via (1,5), then (1,1), then (0,2))**\n   - The **big 8-piece** has a pin-pair (3,16)\u2192(4,21) = (1,5).  \n     Translate so (3,16)\u2192(10,9): **shift (+7,-7)**.\n   - Its remaining (1,1) pin-pair matches the **9-piece** (1,1) pin-pair.  \n     Translate the 9-piece: **shift (-1,+12)**.\n   - The 9-piece\u2019s remaining (0,2) pin-pair matches the **small 8-piece** pins (0,2).  \n     Translate the small 8-piece: **shift (+8,+7)**.\n\n3. **Draw all translated pieces on a blank 26\u00d726 grid**, keeping the base fixed; overlaps only occur on color\u20112 pins.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n- Color **2** cells act as **connectors/ports**.  \n- Every other color forms a **rigid piece** (an object). Pieces are **not rotated**, only **translated**.\n- In the output, the pieces are **assembled** by moving them so that matching connectors **overlap** (the overlapping cell stays color 2). Each overlapped connector ends up sitting **between** two pieces (one on each side).\n- The **color 4 piece stays fixed** in place (it is the anchor); everything else is moved and the rest of the grid is cleared to 0.\n\nSo the task is: keep the 4-object where it is, then slide all other objects until their connector cells (2\u2019s) line up and overlap to form one connected assembly.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n1. **Anchor (color 4)** is the 4\u00d75 rectangle at rows 11\u201314, cols 9\u201313. Its adjacent connectors are at:\n   - (10,9), (11,14), (14,8), (15,10).\n\n2. Find a piece whose **two ports have the same offset** as two anchor ports, so it can \u201csnap\u201d on at two points at once:\n   - The **color 3** piece has a **right-port** and a **top-port** separated by vector **(1,2)**, matching anchor ports (14,8) \u2192 (15,10).  \n     So it is translated so its right-port lands on (14,8) and its top-port lands on (15,10).\n\n   - The large **color 8** piece has a **bottom-port** and a **left-port** separated by vector **(1,5)**, matching anchor ports (10,9) \u2192 (11,14).  \n     So it is translated so its bottom-port lands on (10,9) and its left-port lands on (11,14).\n\n3. Attach remaining pieces by matching the remaining free connector patterns:\n   - The **color 9** piece has a bottom-port and left-port with offset **(1,1)**, matching the remaining (top,right) ports of that large 8-piece, so it snaps onto both.\n   - The small **color 8** piece has two top ports separated by **2**, matching the two remaining bottom ports of the 9-piece.\n   - The **color 1** piece has two top ports separated by **3**, matching the two bottom ports of the placed 3-piece.\n   - The **color 7** bar has two top ports separated by **5**, matching the two bottom ports of the placed 1-piece.\n\nThis uses every connector exactly once (24 ports \u2192 12 overlapped connector cells).\n\n---\n\n### Output grid (26\u00d726)\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n- Each puzzle contains several **separate pieces** (connected components) made of a \u201cmain color\u201d plus some **color 2 pixels**.\n- The **color 2 pixels act as connectors/pins**.  \n  In the solved outputs, pieces are **not rotated**; they are only **translated** so that matching connector-pixels **overlap** (a connection is literally a shared cell of value `2`).\n- The **solid color-4 block is the fixed anchor**: it stays in the same place, and other pieces are moved to plug into its adjacent `2` connector cells.\n- After assembling, everything else is cleared to `0`.\n\n### Applying that to the test\n\n1. **Keep the color-4 rectangle** (rows 11\u201314, cols 9\u201313) fixed, including its adjacent connector `2`s at:\n   - (10,9), (11,14), (14,8), (15,10)\n\n2. **Attach the large 8-piece** to the anchor by matching an L-shaped pair of connectors:\n   - Its bottom connector overlaps (10,9) and its left connector overlaps (11,14).\n\n3. **Attach the 9-piece** to the placed 8-piece by matching another L-shaped connector pair:\n   - Its left connector overlaps the 8-piece\u2019s right connector, and simultaneously its other connector overlaps the 8-piece\u2019s top connector.\n\n4. **Attach the small 8-piece** under the 9-piece by matching a **pair** of connectors (same spacing).\n\n5. **Attach the 3-piece** to the anchor by matching the anchor\u2019s other L-shaped connector pair:\n   - Its right connector overlaps (14,8) and its top connector overlaps (15,10).\n\n6. **Attach the 1-piece** under the 3-piece by matching a connector pair (spacing 3).\n\n7. **Attach the 7-piece** under the 1-piece by matching a connector pair (spacing 5).\n\nThis uses all pieces and all connectors, producing one assembled connected structure.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Key observation from the solved examples\n- Every non\u2011zero shape is a **separate \u201cpiece\u201d**: a main color (e.g. 3,7,8,9,1,4) plus some **color\u20112 cells attached to it**.\n- Color **2** acts as a **connector/pin**.  \n- The transformation **does not rotate or mirror** pieces; it only **translates** (slides) them.\n- The piece containing color **4** is the **anchor**: it stays in place.\n- All other pieces are moved so that **their connector-2 patterns overlap** (same relative spacing between pairs of 2s). The final output is the union of all pieces in their assembled positions; everything else becomes 0.\n\n### Applying this to the test input\n1. **Anchor (color 4)**: the 4\u00d75 block stays fixed. Its connected 2\u2011pins are at:\n   - (10,9), (11,14), (14,8), (15,10)\n\n2. Identify the other pieces and match them by **pairs of connector-2 cells with the same offset**:\n   - The **3-piece** has two bottom pins 3 apart \u2192 matches the **1-piece** two top pins 3 apart.\n   - The **1-piece** has two bottom pins 5 apart \u2192 matches the **7-piece** two top pins 5 apart.\n   - The **9-piece** has two bottom pins 2 apart \u2192 matches the **small 8-piece** two top pins 2 apart.\n   - The remaining two pins of the **9-piece** form a (1,1) diagonal \u2192 matches the **top+right pins of the large 8-piece** (also (1,1)).\n   - The remaining two pins of the **large 8-piece** form a (1,5) offset \u2192 matches the anchor\u2019s (top,right) pins.\n   - The remaining two pins of the **3-piece** form a (1,2) offset \u2192 matches the anchor\u2019s (left,bottom) pins.\n\n3. These overlaps determine unique translations; placing all pieces and taking their union yields the output grid below.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n1. **Color `4` is the fixed \u201cbase\u201d piece.**  \n   In both solved examples, the connected component that contains color `4` stays in the same place in the output.\n\n2. **Color `2` pixels are \u201cconnectors\u201d.**  \n   Every other nonzero connected component (a \u201cpiece\u201d) contains some `2` pixels placed on/near its boundary.  \n   In the output, pieces are **translated (no rotation)** so that connector pixels from different pieces **overlap exactly**. Overlaps happen on color `2` only.\n\n3. **Which connectors match is determined by their relative geometry.**  \n   If two pieces each contain a pair of `2` pixels with the **same displacement vector** (same \u0394row, \u0394col between the two `2`s), then those two pairs are meant to coincide in the final assembly.  \n   This fixes the translation between those pieces.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n**Step A: Identify the pieces (connected components).**  \nPieces present: the base `4`-piece, plus pieces whose main colors are `8` (two separate pieces), `9`, `3`, `1`, `7`.\n\n**Step B: Match connector-pairs by their vectors.**  \nCompute vectors between relevant `2` pairs in each piece:\n\n- Small `8` piece has a `2`\u2013`2` pair with vector **(0,2)**.  \n  The `9` piece has a `2`\u2013`2` pair with vector **(0,2)** (its bottom pair).  \n  \u21d2 **Attach `9` to small `8`** by overlapping those pairs.\n\n- `3` piece has a bottom `2`\u2013`2` pair with vector **(0,3)**.  \n  `1` piece has a top `2`\u2013`2` pair with vector **(0,3)**.  \n  \u21d2 **Attach `3` above `1`**.\n\n- `1` piece has a bottom `2`\u2013`2` pair with vector **(0,5)**.  \n  `7` piece has a top `2`\u2013`2` pair with vector **(0,5)**.  \n  \u21d2 **Attach `1` above `7`**.\n\nNow the remaining unmatched connector pairs:\n\n- The remaining diagonal pair in `9` has vector **(1,1)**, matching a diagonal pair in the large `8` piece (also **(1,1)**).  \n  \u21d2 **Attach `9` to the large `8`** there.\n\n- The large `8` piece also has a connector-pair with vector **(1,5)**, which matches a connector-pair inside the fixed `4` base (also **(1,5)**).  \n  \u21d2 **Attach the large `8` to the fixed `4`**.\n\n- The remaining two connectors in the `3` piece form vector **(1,2)**, matching the remaining connector-pair in the fixed `4` base (**(1,2)**).  \n  \u21d2 **Attach the `3\u20131\u20137` chain to the fixed `4`**.\n\nThese constraints uniquely determine all translations.  \nFinally, **erase everything else to `0`**, keeping only the assembled structure (with the `4` base staying put).\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The non\u2011zero cells form several disconnected \u201cpieces\u201d (connected components using 4\u2011way adjacency).  Color **2** pixels on each piece act like **connectors**: in the solved examples, the pieces are not recolored; instead they are **translated** (no rotation) so that connector patterns **overlap** between pieces, assembling one connected structure. The piece containing color **4** stays fixed and works as the hub.\n\nHow to reconstruct the placement:\n\n1. **Extract pieces** as connected components (including their color\u20112 connector pixels).\n2. Keep the **4\u2011piece** in place.\n3. Attach other pieces by finding a pair of connector pixels on an unplaced piece whose **relative offset** matches a pair of connector pixels on an already placed piece.  \n   Matching two connectors fixes a unique translation; apply it and place the whole piece.\n4. Repeat until all pieces are placed; the output is the union of all placed pieces.\n\nFor the test grid this yields these attachments (each uses a matching pair of connectors):\n- The large **8** piece matches two connectors on the 4\u2011piece \u2192 place it above/right of the 4\u2011piece.\n- The **3** piece matches the left+bottom connectors of the 4\u2011piece \u2192 place it below/left of the 4\u2011piece.\n- The **9** piece matches the remaining (free) connectors on the placed 8\u2011piece \u2192 place it above/right.\n- The small **8** piece matches the bottom connector pair of the 9\u2011piece \u2192 place it below the 9\u2011piece.\n- The **1** piece matches the bottom connector pair of the 3\u2011piece \u2192 place it below the 3\u2011piece.\n- The **7** bar matches the bottom connector pair of the 1\u2011piece \u2192 place it at the bottom.\n\nFinal output grid (27\u00d726):\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",
