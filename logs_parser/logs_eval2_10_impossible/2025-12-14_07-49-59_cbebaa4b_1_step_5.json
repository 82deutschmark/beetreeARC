            "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, here\u2019s my thought process on this ARC task. The user wants me to solve this. I\u2019m an expert, so I\u2019ll try my best.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the transformation. I\u2019ll do this by looking at input/output pairs. I\u2019ll try to figure out the rule. Then I'll apply it to the test input.\n\nI start by looking at Example 1. Both input and output grids are 22x22. In the input, I see shapes made of colored pixels on a black background.\n\nI note the shapes:\n1.  A teal (8s) \"C\" shape with red (2s) at the top.\n2.  A blue (1s) box with some red (2s).\n3.  A yellow (4s) block, also with red (2s).\n4.  A grey (5s) shape.\n5.  A green (3s) shape.\n\nThen I look at the output. The same shapes are there, but moved around. The 3s (green) are at the top, then the 8s (teal), then 4s (yellow), and a mix of the other shapes. It seems like the shapes have been rearranged in a predictable way.\n\nInitially, I think they\u2019re just stacked. Then I notice the red pixels (2s). I think maybe they are important. Every object has red pixels attached. I wonder if they're \"connectors\".\n\nI focus on the connection idea. The shapes seem to be arranged by how their red pixels connect. Like puzzle pieces or Lego blocks. I hypothesize a rule: Each object\u2019s position is determined by how its red pixels (2s) link to others. I start looking to build a graph-like structure based on these connections.\n \nI look at example 2 input and output. The shapes are similar to the previous example and the connections between red pixels determine how each object has been arranged. This solidifies my understanding of the role of these red pixels.\n\nI decide I need a clearer plan to solve this, so I use a graph-like structure to determine each connection.\n\nSo, here's my new plan:\n1.  Identify each object/shape.\n2.  Note where the red pixels (2s) are. Those are \"ports\".\n3.  Arrange the objects so their ports (the red 2s) are connected or overlapping.\n4.  Center the final object in the output grid.\n   \nI\u2019m ready to move onto the test input now and apply my understanding. There are two 8s, a 9s and others that are easily identifiable. I think that the goal is to align these objects by these red pixels to solve this problem.\n\nTo solve this task, I have analyzed the input and output pairs to derive the underlying transformation rule.\n\n**1. Object Decomposition and Connectivity Analysis:**\nThe problem involves assembling a set of scattered shapes (objects) into a coherent structure. Each object is composed of a primary color (1-9) and includes \"connectors\" marked by red pixels (color 2).\n- The red pixels (2) act as connection ports.\n- Objects are assembled such that their red ports overlap.\n- The assembly forms a tree or chain structure, where each connection aligns a pair of ports (one from each object) in both position and configuration.\n- The final structure is centered in the output grid.\n\n**2. Transformation Logic (Graph Assembly):**\nI identified the distinct objects in the test input and their ports:\n- **Orange (7s):** A base bar. Ports at the top.\n- **Blue (1s):** A U-shape. Ports at the bottom (connect to Orange) and top.\n- **Green (3s):** A block. Ports at the bottom (connect to Blue) and top/side.\n- **Yellow (4s):** A block. Ports at the left (connects to Green side) and top/right.\n- **Maroon (9s):** A shape. Ports at the bottom (connects to Green top).\n- **Teal-Left (8s):** A U-shape. Ports at the top (connects to Yellow top-left ports).\n- **Teal-Right (8s):** A box shape. Ports at the left and bottom (connects to Yellow top-right and right-side ports).\n\n**3. Assembly Simulation:**\nBy tracing the connections:\n1.  **Orange** is the base.\n2.  **Blue** sits on Orange.\n3.  **Green** sits on Blue.\n4.  **Maroon** sits on Green.\n5.  **Yellow** attaches to the right side of Green.\n6.  **Teal-Left** sits on the top-left of Yellow.\n7.  **Teal-Right** sits on the top-right/side of Yellow.\n\nI calculated the relative offsets for each object to satisfy the port overlaps and determined the bounding box of the final assembly. Finally, I centered this assembly within the 26x26 output grid.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nThe resulting grid contains the shapes in their assembled positions.\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,2,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,2,8,8,0,0,0,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,9,9,9,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'm approaching this ARC task, boiled down to the core logic:**\n\nI'm dealing with a visual puzzle where the input is a grid full of 0s and some colorful shapes. The goal is to rearrange these shapes, and my primary hypothesis is that the transformation isn't random; it's based on some underlying property or properties of these shapes. The key is in those colored pixels and their arrangement.\n\nI've observed:\n\n*   **Size Matters:** The input grids have objects of varying widths and heights.\n*   **Color Key:** Each number in the grid (1-9) represents a specific color and, crucially, the number 2 has special significance, it's a connector.\n*   **The Connector Connection:** Every shape has at least one pair or pattern of \"2\" pixels, that function as the glue to stick objects together. I think these connectors are how the objects are combined in the output. The shape formed by the 2s inside each object could also determine the sorting order and arrangement.\n*   **Gravity or Structure?** The shapes in the output are usually stacked or form a well-defined structure.\n\nI'm thinking the rules are something like:\n\n1.  **Identify and Isolate:** Find each connected \"object\" within the grid, along with its 2s or connectors.\n2.  **Analyze the 2s:** Look at the distribution or shape of the connector pixels (2s) because it could represent a \"label\" or connection pattern.\n3.  **Sort and Stack:** Use some characteristic (Connector shape, object size, overall color) to sort the objects in a particular order. Then, assemble the objects based on connector patterns (the 2s).\n\nThe core of the problem is figuring out that sorting criteria and how the connectors (2s) dictate the final arrangement. I'm going to carefully read the numbers in the given grid and then try the logic.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we need to transform an input grid of colored pixels into an output grid. Based on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation involves identifying distinct \"objects\" in the input grid and assembling them into a coherent structure in the output grid. The assembly is governed by specific \"connector\" pixels, which are red (color 2).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: We decompose the input grid into distinct objects. Each object consists of a main body of a specific color and associated red pixels (2) that act as connection points.\n    *   **Magenta Object**: Body of 9s, bottom connector `2,0,2`.\n    *   **Teal Object**: Body of 8s, top connector `2,0,2`, bottom connector `2`.\n    *   **Yellow Object**: Body of 4s, top connector `2`, bottom connector `2`.\n    *   **Green Object**: Body of 3s, top connector `2`.\n    *   **Blue Object**: Body of 1s, bottom connectors `2...2`.\n    *   **Orange Object**: Body of 7s, top connectors `2...2`.\n\n2.  **Assembly Logic (The Rules of Physics)**:\n    *   The objects are rigid.\n    *   They must be stacked or connected such that their red connectors match (overlap or interlock).\n    *   The structure is built from the bottom up, or by finding matching interfaces.\n    *   **Right Stack**: The Blue object (1s) has bottom connectors that match the Orange object (7s) top connectors (gap of 4 pixels between the 2s). Thus, **Blue sits on Orange**.\n    *   **Left Stack**:\n        *   The Yellow object (4s) has a bottom connector that matches the Green object (3s) top connector (a single `2` offset to the right). Thus, **Yellow sits on Green**, shifted slightly to the left.\n        *   The Teal object (8s) has a bottom connector that matches the Yellow object's top connector. Thus, **Teal sits on Yellow**, shifted slightly to the left.\n        *   The Magenta object (9s) has a bottom connector (`2,0,2`) that matches the Teal object's top connector (`2,0,2`). Thus, **Magenta sits on Teal**.\n\n3.  **Construction**:\n    *   We create a new grid (initialized to 0).\n    *   We place the **Right Tower** (Orange base, Blue top) and the **Left Tower** (Green base, Yellow, Teal, Magenta) side-by-side.\n    *   The vertical positioning is determined by the height of the objects. The base objects (Green, Orange) are placed at the bottom of the structure.\n    *   The horizontal positioning maintains the relative shifts discovered during the connector matching.\n\n**Final Configuration**:\n*   **Right Column**: Orange (7s) at the bottom, Blue (1s) stacked immediately on top.\n*   **Left Column**: Green (3s) at the bottom, Yellow (4s) on top, Teal (8s) on top of Yellow, Magenta (9s) on top of Teal.\n*   The connectors (2s) are included at the interfaces where the objects meet.\n\n**Output Grid generation**:\nBased on the assembly, the grid is filled with the re-arranged objects.\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

Where two pieces connect, their red connector pixels coincide, becoming shared junction pixels between the two pieces.\n\nApplying this assembly to the test input yields:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Final Assembly of a Complex Puzzle**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this challenging task: to assemble these oddly shaped objects into a single cohesive structure, with a central hub as the anchor. It's like a geometric jigsaw puzzle, but with a twist \u2013 the pieces have to \"plug in\" to each other based on these red connection points.\n\nI've carefully dissected the problem. The core is the yellow hub, this prominent, rectangular block with specific red \"sockets\" on its sides. Each other object is a strangely-shaped \"bracket\" of different colors, each bearing red \"plugs\" at the tips of their arms. The goal is to move these brackets so their plugs fit snugly into the hub\u2019s sockets, or into sockets on other brackets.\n\nThe initial analysis revolves around mapping all the inputs, carefully parsing the grid coordinates of each bracket, looking at their red connection points, and noting their locations relative to each other. For the first example, I looked at a single instance of all the parts and mapped their relative positions. This gives me a \"signature\" for each object: the number, location, and orientation of their plugs and sockets. It helps find how they all piece together.\n\nLooking at the test input, I learned that the hub has multiple connection points: two on the top edge, one on the right edge, and one on the bottom edge. Using these, I figured out the chain of objects in the example. The connections are as follows: Light Blue (plugs fit the top Hub socket) attaches to the Hub, then the Green (plugs fit Light Blue), and the Blue (plug fits the Hub right side and bottom, connecting to two hubs).\n\nWith this knowledge, I approach the current, larger puzzle. I'm focusing on \"plugs\" and \"sockets.\" For each object, I'm identifying the location of the red pixels (which I think are the crucial connecting points). Plugs are single pixels extending from an arm; Sockets, are red pixels nestled within a solid surface. This approach is key: I'm no longer trying to fully visualize the shapes; instead, I'm treating the objects as abstractions of plug and socket locations.\n\nI carefully scan the test input grid, looking for the hub and its associated red connection points. The hub's position and connections are recorded, and these will be the key to constructing the final shape. I also note the dimensions of the hub.\n\nThen I move to the objects, mapping all of their elements and relative positions of all the plugs. The goal is to figure out the right connections: The blue object and the green object both connect to the hub using their specific tips (those red ones).\n\nBased on these plug-socket relationships, I will make the objects move, but not shift their internals, until the red pixels overlap. The outputs in the examples show these pixels remain, so I assume they stay there.\nThe output, then, will be the result of moving objects, one by one, into place according to these rules. The final output is an assembled object with the original shapes, their connectors aligned.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples and the test input, here is the solution:\n\n**Logic and Transformation:**\nThe problem asks to assemble scattered components into a single structure connected to a central Hub.\n1.  **Identify the Hub:** The central object is the large Yellow (`4`) block. It has \"sockets\" represented by Red (`2`) pixels on its perimeter.\n    *   Test Input Hub: Rows 11-14, Columns 9-13 (5x4 block).\n    *   Sockets: (10,9) [Top], (11,14) [Right], (14,8) [Left], (15,10) [Bottom].\n2.  **Identify Components:** Identify other objects (Maroon, Dark Blue, Green, Blue, Orange). They have \"plugs\" (Red `2` pixels at tips) or \"sockets\" for chaining.\n3.  **Determine Connections:** Match each object's plugs to the Hub's sockets (or other objects' sockets) based on orientation and fit.\n    *   **Maroon (9):** Matches Hub Top. Shift right to align tip (10,7) with socket (10,9).\n    *   **Green (3):** Matches Hub Left. Shift to align tip (21,6) roughly to socket (14,8).\n    *   **Dark Blue (8):** Matches Hub Right. Shift to align tip (4,21) with socket (11,14).\n    *   **Blue (1):** Matches Hub Bottom. Shift to align tip (10,19) with socket (15,10).\n    *   **Orange (7):** Connects to the bottom of the Blue object. Blue has sockets at the bottom (Row 14 in input, Row 19 in output). Orange fits directly below.\n\n**Final Coordinates Calculation:**\n*   **Maroon (9):** Input Rows 6-10, Cols 3-7. Shift (+0, +2). Output Rows 6-10, Cols 5-9.\n*   **Dark Blue (8):** Input Rows 1-4. Shift (+7, -7). Output Rows 8-11, Cols 10-16. (Tip matches (11,14)).\n*   **Hub (4):** Fixed at Rows 11-14, Cols 9-13.\n*   **Green (3):** Input Rows 20-23. Shift (-7, +2). Output Rows 13-16, Cols 3-8. (Tip matches (14,8)).\n*   **Blue (1):** Input Rows 10-14. Shift (+5, -9). Output Rows 15-19, Cols 9-15. (Tip matches (15,10)).\n*   **Orange (7):** Input Row 21. Shift (-1, -3). Output Row 20, Cols 9-14. (Attaches to Blue's bottom connectors).\n\nThe output grid is constructed by drawing these shifted objects.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Finalizing the Strategy for ARC Problem Solving**\n\nOkay, so I\u2019ve been given a task to solve an ARC problem with a series of examples. My main goal here is to determine a consistent rule based on the observed patterns. I\u2019m thinking this requires a deep dive into the properties of these gridded structures and how they're transformed between input and output. The grids are quite large with objects and a black background. I noticed that the outputs seem to be composite structures. A major player seems to be the yellow object.\n\n**Identifying the Keys to Transformation**\n\nThe first things I observed were the sizes of the grids and the distribution of colored shapes within them. There\u2019s always a central yellow (4) shape, which is a key element and is the hub, or anchor. Other shapes, which appear to be satellites, such as \u201cC\u201d or \u201cU\u201d shapes, of various colors, are present. The striking visual feature is that these various shapes have \u201cports\u201d, red pixels. These seem to be the connection points for the satellites to the central hub and/or to other satellites.\n\n**Decoding the Transformation Logic**\n\nBased on analyzing the examples, I\u2019m leaning towards a rule that uses the red connectors as guides. Objects are moved such that their red connectors overlap, or attach if one side has the red pixels and the other has a regular surface.  This approach is, in essence, assembling puzzle pieces. My goal is to determine the optimal shifts or rotations to achieve the overlap. I am, however, considering that these can be done on the two axes only.\n\n**Initial Attempt at Applying the Rule**\n\nTo try the rule, I need to look at specific examples. I started with Example 1 where I identified all the shapes and their locations.  I\u2019m looking to see how the connection is done to build the output. I also noticed that the relative positioning of the shapes can affect the final output. The central yellow object in example 1 seems to serve as the main connection point for all other shapes. I\u2019ve gone through example 1 where the blue \"C\" attaches to the bottom, the light blue \"U\" to the top-right, the Green \"U\" to the top, and the gray \"C\" to the right of the hub. I realized that it is not as simple as I originally thought and that there are several possible orientations based on red connections.\n\n**Refining the Rule**\n\nThe transformations involve:\n1)  Identifying a Hub, usually a rectangle.\n2)  Identifying satellites with red connectors.\n3)  Moving the satellites so that red connectors merge (if both shapes have a red surface) or so that a red connector comes in contact with another shape\u2019s surface.\n\n**Validating the Rule with Example 2**\n\nNow, I switched to Example 2 and tried to apply the same rule and principles. I needed to ensure this was a reliable pattern. I was paying close attention to the positioning of shapes and connectors in relation to the main hub. As I went through the example, I saw the need to refine my strategy further. As I moved onto the Test Input, I\u2019m seeing this is going to get a bit complicated. I'm going to focus now on the concept of 'mating' of objects using the red pixels.\n\n**Test Input Breakdown**\n\nI then analyzed the \"Test Input\". The Test input is similar, with the same goal of assembling shapes around the yellow hub and, importantly, preserving the positions of red dots.  For the \u201cTest Input\u201d, I\u2019m now focusing on a more visual approach. It's time to build a solid process for translating the grid layout into transformations. It may take some effort but I think it should all work out in the end.\n\n**A Refined Process for Solution**\n\nThe objective is to accurately translate the positioning of the objects, applying shifts until the red connectors overlap. From previous examples, I have a few things to keep in mind, namely that objects can have various colors, that their sizes vary, that the goal is to create a compact, composite structure.\n\n1.  Identify a central Hub. In the \u201cTest Input\u201d it\u2019s the yellow shape.\n2.  For other shapes, mark down the red connectors and positions.\n3.  Figure out the required translations, which are just shifts.\n4.  Construct the transformed output.\n5.  Check for collisions, and ensure the resulting structure.\n\n**Testing the Process**\n\nI need to confirm all the translations are valid. I will verify that the final positions do not result in collisions. I need to make sure that the output results in a single, connected structure. After checking for collisions, I'll draw the final image and make sure everything is in place. After checking each of these, I think I will be able to successfully complete the test.\n\n\nThe logic for solving this ARC task involves identifying a central \"Hub\" object and several \"Satellite\" objects, then determining the translation (shift) required for each satellite to attach to the hub or to an already-attached satellite. The attachment points are explicitly marked by red pixels (value `2`) on the boundaries of the objects. The goal is to assemble the scattered parts into a single composite structure where the red connectors overlap or touch.\n\n**Step-by-Step Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Hub:**\n    *   The central object is the **Yellow (4)** block.\n    *   Location: Approximately rows 12-15, columns 9-13.\n    *   **Connectors:**\n        *   Right Side: A red pixel `2` at `(row 12, col 14)`.\n        *   Left Side: A red pixel `2` at `(row 15, col 8)`.\n\n2.  **Identify Satellites and Connectors:**\n    *   **Blue (1):** Inverted U-shape (hat) on the right.\n        *   Connectors (outer bottom corners): `(15, 18)` and `(15, 23)`.\n    *   **Light Blue (8):** Irregular shape on the top-right.\n        *   Connectors: `(4, 16)`, `(5, 21)`, `(2, 23)`.\n    *   **Maroon (9):** Arch/Block shape on the left.\n        *   Connectors (bottom): `(11, 5)`, `(11, 7)`, `(11, 9)`.\n    *   **Green (3):** Inverted U/Box shape on the bottom-left.\n        *   Connectors (bottom): `(25, 2)`, `(25, 5)`.\n    *   **Orange (7):** Bar on the bottom-right.\n        *   Connectors (top): `(21, 12)`, `(21, 17)`.\n\n3.  **Determine Translations (Matching Connectors):**\n    *   **Hub to Blue:**\n        *   Target: Hub's right connector `(12, 14)`.\n        *   Source: Blue's left leg connector `(15, 18)`.\n        *   Shift: `(12 - 15, 14 - 18) = (-3, -4)`.\n        *   Blue moves 3 rows up and 4 cols left.\n        *   Blue's other connector `(15, 23)` moves to `(12, 19)`.\n    *   **Blue to Light Blue:**\n        *   Target: Blue's new right connector `(12, 19)`.\n        *   Source: Light Blue's bottom/middle connector `(5, 21)`.\n        *   Shift: `(12 - 5, 19 - 21) = (+7, -2)`.\n        *   Light Blue moves 7 rows down and 2 cols left.\n    *   **Hub to Maroon:**\n        *   Target: Hub's left connector `(15, 8)`.\n        *   Source: Maroon's right connector `(11, 9)`.\n        *   Shift: `(15 - 11, 8 - 9) = (+4, -1)`.\n        *   Maroon moves 4 rows down and 1 col left.\n        *   Maroon's other connectors move to: `(11,7)->(15,6)` and `(11,5)->(15,4)`.\n    *   **Maroon to Green:**\n        *   Target: Maroon's new left connector `(15, 4)`.\n        *   Source: Green's right connector `(25, 5)`.\n        *   Shift: `(15 - 25, 4 - 5) = (-10, -1)`.\n        *   Green moves 10 rows up and 1 col left.\n    *   **Maroon/Hub to Orange:**\n        *   Target: Maroon's new middle connector `(15, 6)`.\n        *   Source: Orange's left connector `(21, 12)`.\n        *   Shift: `(15 - 21, 6 - 12) = (-6, -6)`.\n        *   Orange moves 6 rows up and 6 cols left.\n        *   Check: Orange's right connector `(21, 17)` moves to `(15, 11)`. This aligns with the bottom of the Hub (at row 15, col 11 is a `4`). This is a valid connection.\n\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    *   Start with a black grid.\n    *   Copy each object from the input to the output grid using the calculated shifts.\n    *   **Red pixels (2)** serve as junctions and are preserved where visible (or merged).\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,9,9,8,8,8,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,2,0,0,0,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nNote on overlaps: The `2`s at the junctions `(15,4)`, `(15,6)`, `(15,8)`, `(12,14)`, `(12,19)` are key.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\nIn both examples, there's a yellow (4) block that serves as the central anchor. Various colored shapes are scattered around the input, each with red (2) markers at specific positions. The transformation:\n\n1. The yellow block stays in place as the center\n2. All other shapes move to connect to the yellow block (or to shapes connected to yellow)\n3. Shapes connect where their red markers overlap with yellow's red markers (or other shapes' markers)\n4. The result is a compact, connected arrangement around the yellow center\n\n**Analyzing the Test Input:**\n\n- **Yellow (4) block**: rows 11-14, cols 9-13 with markers at (10,9), (11,14), (14,8), (15,10)\n- **Brown (9)**: rows 6-9, cols 3-7 - connects to yellow's top via its bottom marker\n- **Large Cyan (8)**: rows 1-4, cols 16-22 - connects to yellow's right via its left marker  \n- **Blue (1)**: rows 10-13, cols 18-23 - connects to large cyan's right\n- **Green (3)**: rows 20-23, cols 1-6 - connects to yellow's left via its right marker\n- **Small Cyan (8)**: rows 1-3, cols 10-12 - connects to yellow's bottom via its top markers\n- **Orange (7)**: row 21, cols 12-17 - connects to blue's bottom\n\n**Assembling the output:**\n- Brown shifts right by 2 columns \u2192 cols 5-9\n- Large cyan shifts rows +8, cols -2 \u2192 rows 9-12, cols 14-20\n- Blue shifts cols +2 \u2192 cols 20-25\n- Green shifts rows -7, cols +2 \u2192 rows 13-16, cols 3-8\n- Small cyan shifts rows +14 \u2192 rows 15-17, cols 10-12\n- Orange shifts rows -6, cols +8 \u2192 row 15, cols 20-25\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,0,0,1,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,0,0,1,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,1,0,0,1,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,2,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

Place the remaining pieces by matching pairs of red connectors (same relative spacing) to already\u2011placed free connectors:\n   - The large cyan (8) piece has a connector pair whose offset matches the anchor\u2019s **top+right** connector offset \u2192 it snaps onto those two.\n   - The purple (9) piece has a matching pair to the cyan\u2019s remaining **top+right** connectors \u2192 it snaps onto those two.\n   - The small cyan (8) piece has two top connectors matching the purple\u2019s remaining bottom pair \u2192 it snaps under purple.\n   - The green (3) piece has a connector pair matching the anchor\u2019s **left+bottom** connector offset \u2192 it snaps onto those two.\n   - The blue (1) piece\u2019s top connector pair matches the green\u2019s bottom pair \u2192 it snaps under green.\n   - The orange (7) bar\u2019s top connector pair matches the blue\u2019s bottom pair \u2192 it snaps under blue.\n3.

            "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n- Each input contains several **separate \u201cparts\u201d** (objects).  \n  Each part is made of:\n  - one main color (e.g. 8, 9, 3, 1, 7, \u2026)\n  - some **red connector pixels** (color **2**) attached to it.\n- There is one special **solid block** (in the examples it is color **4**) that acts as the **anchor**.  \n  In the outputs, this block **stays in the same place**.\n- The task is to **assemble** all other parts around the anchor by **translation only** (no rotation/flip), so that:\n  - connector pixels (2) of two parts **overlap exactly** (same cell),\n  - non\u2011connector colored pixels never overlap,\n  - in the final assembly every connector pixel is \u201cpaired\u201d (shared by exactly two parts).\n\nA practical way to reconstruct the assembly (as in the examples) is:\n1. Keep the color\u20114 block fixed.\n2. Look at its connector pixels (2). They come in **pairs** with a specific offset (vector).\n3. Find another piece that has a connector pair with the **same offset**, and translate it so the two connectors coincide.\n4. That placed piece will have remaining connector pairs; repeat outward until all pieces are placed.\n\n---\n\n### Applying this to the test input\n\n**Anchor (color 4)** stays fixed (rows 11\u201314, cols 9\u201313).  \nIts 4 connectors are at:\n- (10,9), (11,14), (14,8), (15,10)\n\nThese split into two unique offset pairs:\n- (10,9) \u2192 (11,14) is offset **(1,5)**  \n  This matches a connector-pair inside the **large 8-piece**, so translate that 8-piece to overlap those two connectors.\n- (14,8) \u2192 (15,10) is offset **(1,2)**  \n  This matches a connector-pair inside the **3-piece**, so translate the 3-piece to overlap those two connectors.\n\nThen continue chaining from the newly exposed connector pairs:\n- The placed large\u20118 exposes a **(1,1)** connector pair \u2192 matches the **9-piece**.\n- The placed 9-piece exposes a **(0,2)** connector pair \u2192 matches the **small 8-piece**.\n- The placed 3-piece exposes a **(0,3)** connector pair \u2192 matches the **1-piece**.\n- The placed 1-piece exposes a **(0,5)** connector pair \u2192 matches the **7-bar**.\n\nThis uses all parts and pairs all connectors, with no illegal overlaps.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid (26\u00d726)\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "### Observations from the solved examples\n- The non\u2011zero cells form several **separate \u201cpieces\u201d**. Each piece is a **4\u2011connected component if we ignore color** (i.e., any non\u2011zero cell touching any other non\u2011zero cell belongs to the same piece).\n- Color **2** acts as a **connector color**: these 2-cells sit on the boundary of a piece and are meant to **overlap** with connector cells of other pieces.\n- There is one special piece: a **solid filled rectangle** (in the examples it\u2019s the yellow block; here it\u2019s color **4**). This is the **anchor** and it **does not move**.\n- All other pieces are **translated only** (no rotation/reflection) so that:\n  - Connector cells (color 2) from different pieces **land on the same coordinates**.\n  - The resulting arrangement becomes **one connected assembly** (through the shared connector cells).\n  - In practice, many joins use **two connectors at once** (same spacing), forcing a unique alignment.\n\n### Apply to the test input\n1. **Anchor**: the filled color\u20114 rectangle at rows 11\u201314, cols 9\u201313 stays fixed, along with its attached connector 2-cells.\n2. Build rigid subassemblies by matching **pairs of connectors** (same spacing):\n   - The **9-piece** bottom connector pair matches the **small 8-piece** top connector pair \u2192 stack them by overlapping those two 2-cells.\n   - The **3-piece** bottom connector pair matches the **1-piece** top connector pair \u2192 overlap.\n   - The **1-piece** bottom connector pair matches the **7-piece** top connector pair \u2192 overlap.\n3. Use the remaining **single connectors** to attach assemblies to the anchor:\n   - Move the **large 8-frame** so its down-connector overlaps the anchor\u2019s top connector; this simultaneously makes another connector overlap on the anchor\u2019s right side (same relative offset as in the examples).\n   - Attach the (9+small8) stack to the remaining two connectors of that large 8-frame.\n   - Attach the (3+1+7) stack to the remaining two connectors of the anchor.\n4. Everything else becomes 0.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid (26\u00d726)\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs keep the same set of pieces (same colors/shapes) and mainly **reposition** them.\n* Pieces are **assembled into one compact cluster**, often forming enclosed black holes via outline parts.\n* **Red pixels consistently sit on piece extremities** and end up at **interfaces/joints** in the assembled result.\n* Assembly appears to use **translations only** (no visible rotation/reflection), with the composite roughly **centered**.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, let's break down this ARC problem. The user wants me to figure out a pattern for assembling these shapes, like a puzzle. The hint about red pixels acting as joints is crucial.**\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI see shapes of different colors \u2013 like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. The key is those red pixels (color 2). They're always at the edges or where pieces connect. In Example 1, everything gets neatly stacked: Green on top, then Light Blue, Yellow, Blue, and Grey to the right of Blue. It looks like the red pixels are the glue, pulling the pieces together at their extremities. The hints confirm this, suggesting we have \"snapping points\" where the red pixels match. I trace where the red pixels are, noting the relative locations on each piece. I suspect that overlapping these pixels is the key to connecting everything.\n\nFor instance, the Yellow 3x3 square has red pixels above, below, and on its right edge. The Light Blue shape has red pixels at its top-left and top-right, and on the lower \"legs.\" The stacking pattern reveals a top-to-bottom assembly. The \"red pixels are connectors\" hypothesis solidifies. The red pixels will overlap in the final image, where their relative coordinates, when considered a vector, must result in a single pixel on the final grid. I carefully identify the connections between each shape based on overlapping red pixels.\n\n**Test Input application:**\n\nArmed with the \"red pixel = joint\" concept, I analyze the given test input with a fresh approach.\nI start by identifying the shapes within the input and their red pixel \"ports\". Each piece has some distinctive shape (green frame, yellow block, etc.), and the goal is to define their red pixels in a generalizable way. I note each shape's position, size, and associated red connectors.\n\nNow, I look for how each shape's red connectors can attach to other shapes. I need to figure out which pieces are going to join together, and how. I re-read the input, the shapes, the connectors, and keep returning to the examples.\nI start by making a mental graph of how the pieces might fit. Example 1 stacked everything. Maybe I can do something similar here? I'll re-check all of the pieces' characteristics - particularly their sizes.\n\nI then try different \"nesting\" plans, like putting one shape inside another (like a box inside another box), but that doesn't work. The nesting hypothesis fails. I start looking at stacking again.\n\nBased on the example, I try a \"rocket\" like stack. This fails - I'm missing something about how the shapes relate. I look for the shapes that share similar geometries - like the red connectors hint.\n\nThen I carefully go back, thinking that perhaps a Red pixel's relative position on one shape, has a mirror, relative Red pixel on the mating shape.\n\nIf the red pixels define a \"graph\", how do these \"connections\" create the assembly?  Based on the red pixels, I try to arrange the shapes to match the relative positions in Example 1. After more careful measuring, and analyzing the \"inside\" the shapes hypothesis fails.\nI refine the hypothesis. The pieces will build into a stack.\n\n*   The widths of various pieces are measured.\n*   This suggests nesting\n*   But it's not clear which goes where.\n\nI try to visualize the Output. This takes some effort - working out how each shape maps to a column in the output. I draw the pieces and measure the sizes. The hints about the red pixels, and the shapes, suggest a bottom up assembly. Each shape is drawn one at a time. The positions are worked out, and adjusted.\n\n**Final Construction:**\n\nFinally, after lots of testing, I create the output image as a sequence of layers:\n\n*   Yellow block inside a F2 box (7x4 size).\n*   Orange Bar on top of the box.\n*   Green frame on top of the Orange bar.\n*   Blue U shape at the top.\n\nI will then check that I haven't mixed up my red pixels, and the construction is consistent.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the pieces, their connectors (red pixels), and the stacking logic observed in Example 1, the solution involves assembling the scattered components into a single vertical tower centered in the grid.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Identify Components:**\n    *   **F2 (8, Light Blue):** Large container box (7 wide).\n    *   **Yellow (4):** Block (5 wide). Fits inside F2.\n    *   **Maroon (9):** Box (5 wide). Fits inside F2.\n    *   **F1 (8, Light Blue):** Small U-shape (3 wide). Fits inside Maroon.\n    *   **Orange (7):** Horizontal bar (6 wide). Acts as a separator/lid.\n    *   **Green (3):** Frame (6 wide). Sits on top of Orange.\n    *   **Blue (1):** U-shape (6 wide). Sits on top of Green.\n\n2.  **Assembly Order (Bottom to Top):**\n    *   **Base:** The **F2** container is at the bottom.\n    *   **Inside Base:** The **Yellow** block fills the bottom of F2, and the **Maroon** box sits on top of the Yellow block (within F2). The **F1** shape is nested inside the Maroon box.\n    *   **Connector:** The **Orange** bar sits on top of the F2 container, bridging the transition from width 7 (odd) to width 6 (even).\n    *   **Middle:** The **Green** frame sits on the Orange bar.\n    *   **Top:** The **Blue** U-shape sits on top of the Green frame.\n\n3.  **Red Pixels:** The red pixels (2) from the input are preserved at the \"joints\" where pieces meet (e.g., corners, interfaces between stacked layers).\n\n4.  **Placement:** The assembly is roughly centered in the 26x26 grid. The width 7 piece (F2) is centered (cols 8-14). The width 6 pieces (Orange, Green, Blue) are centered/offset (cols 8-13). The width 5/3 pieces fit centrally within their containers.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   **Rows 7-10:** Blue (1) shape.\n*   **Row 11:** Interface Blue/Green (Red pixels).\n*   **Rows 12-15:** Green (3) shape.\n*   **Row 16:** Interface Green/Orange (Red pixels).\n*   **Row 17:** Orange (7) bar.\n*   **Row 18:** Interface Orange/F2 (Red pixels).\n*   **Rows 19-22:** F2 (8) container.\n    *   Inside: Maroon (9) containing F1 (8), then Yellow (4).\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,9,9,9,9,9,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,9,2,0,2,9,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,9,8,0,8,9,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,8,8,8,2,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,4,4,4,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,4,4,4,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs keep the same set of pieces (same colors/shapes) and mainly **reposition** them.\n* Pieces are **assembled into one compact cluster**, often forming enclosed black holes via outline parts.\n* **Red pixels consistently sit on piece extremities** and end up at **interfaces/joints** in the assembled result.\n* Assembly appears to use **translations only** (no visible rotation/reflection), with the composite roughly **centered**.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Task Analysis and Solution Hypothesis**\n\nOkay, the goal is to build a program to solve this ARC problem based on the provided examples. The system presents a collection of colored shapes in an input grid, and the task is to re-assemble them into a single, connected cluster in the output grid. The key idea seems to revolve around interpreting red pixels as \"connectors\" or \"latches\" that dictate how the shapes should be joined. The examples suggest that shapes are *translated* but not *rotated*. Let's break this down.\n\n**Initial Examination: Example 1**\n\nFirst, I looked at Example 1 and noticed five shapes in a 22x22 grid, each with their characteristic colors and pixel patterns. The red pixels are critical. They sit at the extremities of the shapes and seem to play a role in how the shapes are connected in the final output. The output, in turn, is also 22x22, and reveals the reassembled cluster. Tracing the red pixels carefully, it looked like they were positioned in such a way that they would become adjacent or overlap after translation.  The red pixels, being `2`s, effectively *merge* or *connect* when they become adjacent. \n\nA central shape appeared to be a yellow block, and all other shapes seemed to branch from it in some way. The relative positions in the output grid also provided clues: Green on top, Cyan below, Yellow to the right, Blue at the side.\n\nCareful coordinate mapping of the red pixels for each shape, however, revealed that the shapes' positions weren't always intuitive. The blue shape, for instance, had some red pixels that might seem a bit weird, but if I looked at them as defining a connector shape, I was able to begin seeing the patterns. I then tested the connections via the red pixels.\n\nIt seemed that the shapes could be translated such that their red pixel positions met up. If I had to describe this, it felt like doing a jigsaw puzzle where the connection pieces are the `2` pixels. I am calling this the \"Connect the Reds\" hypothesis.\n\n**Verification: Example 1 Revisited**\n\nTo test this \"Connect the Reds\" hypothesis, I mapped each shape as a rigid body and figured out the location of its red pixel connectors:\n\n-   Yellow (4):  has a 3x3 core with red pixels at the top, bottom, and right side.\n-   Cyan (8): This appears to be a box shape with the left side missing. Red pixels at each of the four corners (as you might see in a rectangle shape).\n-   Green (3): Red pixels at a top and the bottom, as if on a vertical piece with a horizontal bar at the top\n-   Blue (1): Red at the ends of its \"wrench\" shape (left and right).\n-   Gray (5): Red on left side horizontal bar.\nBy looking at the output, the red connectors *were* aligned. Cyan connected to yellow (top-bottom); Green was above Cyan, and so on.\n\nLooking at example 1, I noted:\n* Green bottom connects to Cyan top\n* Cyan bottom connects to Yellow top.\n* Yellow right connects to Blue left.\n* Blue right connects to Gray left.\nI could trace this, or visualize it as a chain that brought the pieces into the target position.\n\n**Verification with Example 2**\n\nThis new hypothesis now has to stand up against a second example.  Example 2 has three shapes: Magenta (6), Yellow (4) and Green (3), Blue (1), and Cyan (8), all in 22x22. Once again, I had to identify red pixels for each shape and how those red pixels were placed in the output. Based on this, I could define new relative locations and connector points.\n\n- Magenta connects to Blue at their sides.\n- Blue connects to Yellow.\n- Yellow connects to Green.\n- Cyan is then on top of Green.\n\n**Test Input Application**\n\nBased on this evidence, I am now confident in my strategy. The system gives me a new 26x26 input. My approach is:\n\n1.  **Shape identification:** Identify all the shapes in the input grid, their colors, and their red pixel connectors.\n2.  **Connector mapping:** Carefully record the relative positions of the red pixels for each shape, defining the connector patterns.\n3.  **Connection matching:** Apply the \"Connect the Reds\" hypothesis: Identify how these connectors can be aligned to bring shapes together. Spacing (how far apart are the red `2` pixels?) and orientation matter.\n4.  **Assembly sequence:** Trace the chain to find a plausible arrangement to form a compact cluster (this step is guided by shape and the positions from the inputs).\n5.  **Coordinate Mapping:** Determine how much\n\nTo solve this task, I identified the individual \"pieces\" in the input grid and analyzed their red pixel (color 2) \"connectors\". The puzzle logic implies that pieces must be translated so that their red connectors overlap, effectively assembling a single compact shape.\n\n**Piece Analysis & Connectivity Logic:**\n1.  **Gray Piece (Right)** [Cols 16-23]: This is the central hub.\n    -   Connectors: Top-Left `(1,16)` & `(1,18)`, Bottom `(4,21)`, Right `(1,23)`.\n2.  **Maroon Piece** [Cols 3-7]:\n    -   Connectors: Left `(8,3)`, Bottom `(10,5)` & `(10,7)`.\n    -   **Match:** Maroon Bottom fits Gray Top-Left (Spacing 2).\n3.  **Yellow Piece** [Cols 9-14]:\n    -   Connectors: Top `(10,9)`, Left `(14,8)`, Right `(11,14)`.\n    -   **Match:** Yellow Right fits Maroon Left (Single point align).\n    -   **Match:** Gray Bottom fits Yellow Top? No, checked logic suggests Gray acts as anchor. Re-evaluating: Yellow connects to Maroon's Left.\n4.  **Green Piece** [Cols 1-6]:\n    -   Connectors: Right `(21,6)` & `(20,4)`, Bottom `(24,2)` & `(24,5)`.\n    -   **Match:** Green Right fits Yellow Left.\n5.  **Blue Piece** [Cols 18-23]:\n    -   Connectors: Top (implied at `10,22`), Bottom `(14,18)` & `(14,23)`.\n    -   **Match:** Blue Top fits Gray Bottom `(4,21)` -> `(10,22)`.\n6.  **Orange Piece** [Cols 12-17]:\n    -   Connectors: Top `(20,12)` & `(20,17)`.\n    -   **Match:** Orange Top fits Blue Bottom (Spacing 5).\n\nThere is a small Gray piece on the left (Cols 10-12) which appears to be a distractor or conflicts with the assembled structure (specifically overlapping the Yellow piece), so it is excluded.\n\n**Assembly Shifts (Calculated):**\n-   **Gray Piece** (Base): Shift `(+9, -1)`.\n-   **Maroon Piece**: Shift `(0, +10)`.

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs keep the same set of pieces (same colors/shapes) and mainly **reposition** them.\n* Pieces are **assembled into one compact cluster**, often forming enclosed black holes via outline parts.\n* **Red pixels consistently sit on piece extremities** and end up at **interfaces/joints** in the assembled result.\n* Assembly appears to use **translations only** (no visible rotation/reflection), with the composite roughly **centered**.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs keep the same set of pieces (same colors/shapes) and mainly **reposition** them.\n* Pieces are **assembled into one compact cluster**, often forming enclosed black holes via outline parts.\n* **Red pixels consistently sit on piece extremities** and end up at **interfaces/joints** in the assembled result.\n* Assembly appears to use **translations only** (no visible rotation/reflection), with the composite roughly **centered**.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Identify \u201cpieces\u201d as connected components** of all non\u2011zero cells.  \n   Each piece is mostly one color, but has some **red (2) pixels on its extremities**.\n\n2. The **yellow (4) rectangle is the anchor piece**: in both examples it stays **exactly in place**.  \n   All other pieces are moved by **translation only**.\n\n3. **Assemble pieces by matching red connector pixels**:\n   - In the final cluster, red pixels become **joints** where two pieces meet.\n   - This happens by **overlapping red pixels** from two pieces (not by touching edges).\n   - Valid overlaps are red-on-red; the other colored pixels must not overlap.\n\n4. Placement is determined by finding translations that make **multiple red connectors coincide at once** (same relative spacing), producing a single compact connected cluster.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test\n\n- Keep the **4-rectangle** fixed.\n- Attach the **large 8 piece** to the anchor by aligning its **down** and **left** red connectors to the anchor\u2019s **up** and **right** connectors (their spacing matches).\n- Attach the **3 piece** to the anchor by aligning its **right** and **up** red connectors to the anchor\u2019s **left** and **down** connectors (spacing matches).\n- Then forced by remaining connector types/spacings:\n  - **9 piece** attaches to the large 8 using its only left-connector (also aligns a second joint).\n  - **small 8 piece** attaches under the 9 (two connectors spaced by 2).\n  - **1 piece** attaches under the 3 (two connectors spaced by 3).\n  - **7 bar** attaches under the 1 (two connectors spaced by 5).\n\nThis uses every red connector as a joint and produces one connected cluster.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs keep the same set of pieces (same colors/shapes) and mainly **reposition** them.\n* Pieces are **assembled into one compact cluster**, often forming enclosed black holes via outline parts.\n* **Red pixels consistently sit on piece extremities** and end up at **interfaces/joints** in the assembled result.\n* Assembly appears to use **translations only** (no visible rotation/reflection), with the composite roughly **centered**.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "From the examples, each *piece* is a connected component of non\u2011zero cells (including the red `2` cells). Pieces are not rotated; they are only **translated**. The red `2` cells act as **connectors**: in the assembled output, connectors end up at **joints**, meaning a red connector cell from one piece is moved to **overlap** a red connector cell from another piece (so you still see a single red cell there).\n\n### 1) Identify the pieces and their connectors\nIn the test input there are 7 separate pieces (main colors 4,8,8,9,3,1,7). For each piece, the red cells sit at extremities and form distinctive \u201cconnector patterns\u201d:\n\n- The big `4` rectangle (with 4 red connectors) is the natural anchor (it stays in place in the solved examples).\n- The long `7` bar has **two top connectors** separated by 5 columns.\n- The `1` piece has **two bottom connectors** separated by 5 columns (so it must mate with the `7` piece), and **two top connectors** separated by 3 columns.\n- The `3` piece has **two bottom connectors** separated by 3 columns (so it must mate with the `1` piece), and two remaining connectors whose relative offset matches the remaining left+bottom connectors on the `4` anchor.\n- The small `8` piece has **two top connectors** separated by 2 columns.\n- The `9` piece has **two bottom connectors** separated by 2 columns (so it must mate with the small `8`), plus one remaining bottom connector and one side connector.\n- The large `8` piece has 4 connectors (one each direction); two of them match the `4` anchor\u2019s top+right connector offset (so it mates to the anchor with two joints), and its other two match the `9` piece\u2019s remaining two connectors (again with two joints).\n\nBecause these connector-pairs have matching internal offsets, each of these connections is forced (a single translation aligns both red cells simultaneously).\n\n### 2) Assemble by matching connector pairs (translations only)\nKeeping the `4` block fixed, we translate and attach in a forced chain:\n\n- `7` attaches under `1` (two connectors at distance 5).\n- `1` attaches under `3` (two connectors at distance 3).\n- `3` attaches to the `4` anchor (two remaining connectors match the anchor\u2019s left+bottom).\n- Large `8` attaches to the `4` anchor (two connectors match the anchor\u2019s top+right).\n- `9` attaches to the large `8` (two remaining connectors match).\n- Small `8` attaches under `9` (two connectors at distance 2).\n\nThis uses every red connector exactly once and produces one compact connected cluster.\n\n### Output grid\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs keep the same set of pieces (same colors/shapes) and mainly **reposition** them.\n* Pieces are **assembled into one compact cluster**, often forming enclosed black holes via outline parts.\n* **Red pixels consistently sit on piece extremities** and end up at **interfaces/joints** in the assembled result.\n* Assembly appears to use **translations only** (no visible rotation/reflection), with the composite roughly **centered**.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n1. **Non\u2011zero cells form separate \u201cpieces\u201d** (connected components using 4\u2011connectivity).  \n   Each piece is mostly one color, but has some **red (color 2) pixels** attached.\n\n2. Those **red pixels are connectors**:\n   - A red pixel always sits on an *extremity* of its piece (adjacent to the main colored body).\n   - In the output, pieces are **translated only** (no rotation/reflection) and **assembled** so that\n     **red connector pixels from two pieces overlap in the same cell**, becoming a **joint**.\n   - All other colored pixels must not overlap.\n\n3. In both solved examples, the **yellow piece (color 4)** stays in the **exact same location** and acts as the **anchor**. All other pieces move to connect into one compact cluster around it.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n**Step 1: Identify pieces**\nThe test has these components:\n- One large **color 4** rectangle with 4 red connectors \u2192 this is the **anchor** (kept fixed).\n- A large **color 8** piece with 4 red connectors.\n- A **color 9** piece with 4 red connectors.\n- A small **color 8** piece with 2 red connectors.\n- A **color 3** piece with 4 red connectors.\n- A **color 1** \u201cframe\u201d piece with 4 red connectors.\n- A **color 7** bar with 2 red connectors.\n\n**Step 2: Match connectors (red pixels) by shape/spacing**\nSome matches are forced because the connector pairs have the same spacing:\n- The **1-frame** top two reds match the **3-piece** bottom two reds.\n- The **7-bar** top two reds match the **1-frame** bottom corner reds.\n- The **small 8** top two reds match the **9-piece** bottom two reds.\n- The remaining connectors form a chain that links everything back to the fixed **4** piece:\n  - The **large 8** connects to the **4** (two joints),\n  - The **9** connects to the **large 8** (two joints),\n  - The **3** connects to the **4** (two joints),\n  - Then **3 \u2192 1 \u2192 7** continues downward via the forced matches above.\n\n**Step 3: Translate each non\u20114 piece so the matched red connector cells coincide**\nBecause the 4\u2011piece is fixed, these translations are uniquely determined; the result is the assembled cluster below.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid (27\u00d726)\n\n```csv\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\n### Common elements\n- **Background** is uniformly **black** in all inputs and outputs.\n- Multiple **disconnected colored components** appear in each input.  \n  Each component is **multicolored**: a *main color* (e.g., blue/green/cyan/gray/magenta/yellow) plus several **red** pixels attached to the component.\n- The **output** contains the **same set of colored components** (same colors/shapes), but they are no longer scattered: they appear **brought together into one compact cluster**.\n\n### Pair 1 (Input 1 \u2192 Output 1)\n**Input 1:**\n- Several separate components:\n  - A **blue** hollow/outline-like shape with an internal black area; it includes several **red** pixels on/near its outer corners/ends.\n  - A **cyan (light blue)** shape with multiple \u201carms/legs\u201d (a branched outline-like form), also with **red** pixels at extremities.\n  - A **yellow** solid block (roughly square) with **red** pixels protruding around it (appearing on multiple sides).\n  - A small **green** arch/\u201c\u03a0\u201d-like shape with **red** pixels at the two lower ends.\n  - A **gray** bracket/\u201cC\u201d-like outline piece with **red** pixels at its endpoints.\n- All components are separated by black space.\n\n**Output 1:**\n- The same colored components appear, but **translated** so they form a **single connected/near-connected assembly**.\n- The components are **much closer**; several are **touching at red-marked areas**.\n- No new colors appear; the black background remains.\n\n### Pair 2 (Input 2 \u2192 Output 2)\n**Input 2:**\n- Several separate components again:\n  - A **blue** outline/bracket-like piece with **red** pixels at ends/corners.\n  - A **green** outline/bracket-like piece with **red** pixels at ends/corners.\n  - A **cyan** arch/\u201c\u03a0\u201d-like piece with **red** pixels at its ends.\n  - A **magenta** arch/\u201c\u03a0\u201d-like piece with **red** pixels at its ends.\n  - A **yellow** solid square-like block with **red** protrusions around it.\n- All pieces are disconnected and scattered.\n\n**Output 2:**\n- All pieces are **repositioned** into a **tight composite** near the center.\n- The composite includes **enclosed black cavities (holes)** formed by the arrangement of outline-like pieces.\n- Colors/shapes of the pieces are preserved; the background stays black.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement:** **present** (pieces are clearly translated)\n- **Object recoloring:** **absent** (colors appear unchanged)\n- **Bordering / outlining:** **absent**\n- **Filling holes or cavities:** **absent** (holes remain holes; in fact holes can become more evident)\n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** **absent**\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** **present** (repositioning of whole components)\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center):** **maybe** (final assembly appears centrally placed)\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** **maybe** (red behaves like a special marker; yellow is also special-looking)\n- **Size-based filtering or selection:** **absent** (all pieces seem kept)\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations:** **absent** (no clear flipping/rotation visible)\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** **absent**\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** **absent**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial patterns)\n\n1. **Each output preserves every input component\u2019s internal geometry** (same pixel pattern per component) and changes primarily their **relative placement**\u2014suggesting a \u201cmove/assemble pieces\u201d task rather than redraw/recolor.\n2. **Red pixels systematically occur at extremities/corners of pieces** and, in the outputs, many red pixels end up **exactly where pieces meet**\u2014strongly implying red marks are *connection/joint* locations rather than decoration.\n3. The **yellow solid block** is the only clearly **filled** piece, while many others are **outline-like with holes**; in both outputs, the yellow block ends up **embedded within the assembled cluster**, consistent with a \u201chub\u201d or \u201ccore\u201d role in the assembly.\n4. **No rotations are apparent**: pieces keep the same orientation between input and output, implying assembly is done via **translations only**.\n5. The final result is not just \u201ccloser together\u201d; it becomes **structurally interlocked**, creating or maintaining **enclosed cavities** (especially clear in Output 2), indicating the arrangement is constrained by how outlines fit together, not arbitrary packing.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nThe task appears to **identify all disconnected multi-colored pieces** (each piece includes red marker pixels) and then **translate them (without rotation)** to form a **single compact assembled structure**. The **red pixels behave like connection points**, so the assembly likely aligns pieces so that these red-marked endpoints/corners coincide or directly meet, producing a coherent composite (often with enclosed holes). The assembled composite is then placed roughly **centered** on the output canvas.\n\n(Alternate likely family if the exact connector logic is ambiguous: \u201cpack pieces together into a canonical compact layout, prioritizing alignments at red-marked extremities and using the yellow block as the central reference.\u201d)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks to perform when solving (validation probes)\n\n1. **Component invariance check:** verify each output piece is an exact translation of an input connected component (same shape mask and colors).\n2. **Red-as-joint check:** compare the count/locations of red pixels; test whether many red pixels in output have neighbors from *two different* non-black regions (suggesting junctions).\n3. **No-rotation check:** confirm orientations match by comparing bounding-box patterns of each component before/after.\n4. **Yellow-anchor check:** test whether the yellow block is always placed first/centrally and other pieces\u2019 red endpoints align to red protrusions on the yellow block (directly or via chains).\n5. **Centering check:** compute bounding box of the final composite and see if it\u2019s systematically centered (or aligned to a consistent margin) in the output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* Outputs keep the same set of pieces (same colors/shapes) and mainly **reposition** them.\n* Pieces are **assembled into one compact cluster**, often forming enclosed black holes via outline parts.\n* **Red pixels consistently sit on piece extremities** and end up at **interfaces/joints** in the assembled result.\n* Assembly appears to use **translations only** (no visible rotation/reflection), with the composite roughly **centered**.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n` tags. Let's see...\n\nI'm seeing a consistent pattern across the grids. First, the background is always color 0. That's a simple one. The main thing that sticks out in each grid is a solid, rectangular block, always colored 4. This seems to be the central \"anchor\" or \"hub\". It might be 3x3 or sometimes 5x3, but the block itself is consistently solid.\n\nThen, around this central core, there are these interesting rectangular \"loops\" or \"handles\". They are hollow rectangles - essentially rectangular outlines. The colors of these loops are what vary \u2013 I've seen them as 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  Sometimes, the connections aren't complete loops, and they look more like lines extending from the core.\n\nThe crucial bit, connecting these \"loops\" to the central block, are small single pixels of color 2. These seem to act as the \"joints\" or \"connectors\" between the two. In Grid 4, there is a line of color 7 in the top center. It's a linear segment that extends from the central mass.\n\nSo, it seems to boil down to these fundamental objects: the color 0 background, the solid color 4 block, the color 2 connectors, and the various-colored rectangular/linear shapes. That should cover it. Now, to write this up in a concise way.\n\nHere's my attempt:\n\n```\n<objects_summary> background: color 0; central_core: solid rectangle, color 4; connectors: single pixels, color 2; peripheral_structures: hollow rectangular loops or lines, various colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), connected to core via connectors.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep the color 4 solid rectangle fixed as the anchor. Treat each other colored shape (colors !=0,2,4) together with its adjacent color 2 pixels as a movable module. Translate modules (no rotation/reflection/recolor) so that their color 2 connector patterns overlap matching color 2 connector patterns on the anchor or already placed modules. Overlapping connectors merge as color 2 joints, forming one connected assembled structure; all vacated cells become 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Solution Breakdown: My Thinking Process**\n\nOkay, so I've got this ARC problem to solve. I'm given some input/output pairs, a text description (which I'll use as guidelines), and a test input. Here's how I'm approaching this:\n\n1.  **Understand the Transformation:** My first goal is to figure out the rule. I need to look at the example input/output grids and see how the input changes into the output. I'm focusing on the colors, the shapes, and how they relate to each other. I'm watching for any obvious patterns.\n2.  **Use the Descriptors:** The \"Object Description\" and \"Transformation Description\" are my guide. They should provide clues. I will use them to form a hypothesis.\n3.  **Apply the Rule:** Once I think I know what's happening, I will apply that rule to the test input, step by step. I am looking at the individual shapes, their locations, and how they should be transformed based on the examples.\n4.  **Explain My Steps:** I need to write down my thinking, every step of the way. This includes the shapes, their location, my attempts, and the reasons I moved something or made a certain decision.\n5.  **Provide the Final Answer:** My final task is to construct the output grid based on the transformation and all my intermediate actions.\n\n**In Action:**\n\nI began by closely analyzing the two examples. In both cases, there's a central yellow (4) solid rectangle. That is my base object. Then there are some shapes, mostly with a \"red\" (2) connector. I noticed a pattern where these colored shapes would move so their red connectors (the sockets) line up with the red pixels on the yellow block (the target). I'm thinking, this \"red\" color is a connection point.\n\n**Initial Hypothesis:**\n\nMy initial hypothesis is:\n\n1.  Find the base: The yellow (4) rectangle.\n2.  Find movable shapes: The ones with \"connectors\" (red pixels).\n3.  Identify connection locations (sockets) on the base: the red pixels around the base.\n4.  Move the movable shapes so their \"connectors\" align with base's sockets. The colors will stay.\n\n**Applying the Hypothesis to the Test Input:**\n\nI then started to apply this to the test input. I identified a larger yellow (4) rectangle (the base). Now I looked at the colored shapes. I saw a maroon (9) shape, a light blue (8) structure, green (3) brackets, and some orange (7) bits. Each of these have red pixels on them! This red pattern will give me the socket locations. I made a list:\n\n*   Yellow Base: Found its top, left, right, and bottom borders by looking for the yellow and the adjacent \"2\" pixels.\n*   Shape 1: Maroon (9) rectangle. It's connected to the base at the top. This shape can be described to form a single entity, which already includes some pixels.\n*   Shape 2: Light Blue (8) structure. I broke it down to be two components (A and B, for clarity).\n*   Shape 3: Green (3) shape and its location.\n*   Shape 4: Blue (1) shape.\n*   Shape 5: Orange (7) structure.\n\nI tried a few configurations by thinking about their red connectors and their positions. I considered where the shapes' connectors would fit to the base's red pixels. I also considered where other shaped red sockets are. For example, B has an upper structure, with the connecting pixels below the rectangle - and B also has pixels. This way I could use A and B to fit a connection. The test was if, by attaching shape A, does B fit the geometry? What will happen if I shift the shape so its pixels overlap?\n\nThrough a lot of trial and error (and revisiting the examples to make sure I was interpreting things correctly), I finally ended up with a valid configuration. Through testing, I found out that I can solve this using:\n\n*   **Move Maroon to the right socket.**\n*   **Move A and B Bottom Right**\n*   **Move Orange and Blue to the Bottom Left**\n\nAfter going through many combinations and double-checking everything, I believe I have the correct arrangement that fits the pattern of \"connectors aligning with sockets.\" I'm confident my thought process here is complete and correct.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, I need to assemble the scattered \"modules\" around the central \"base\" object.\n\n**1. Identify the Base and Sockets**\nThe base is the solid Yellow (4) block located at Rows 11-14, Columns 9-13.\nThe \"sockets\" are the Red (2) pixels adjacent to this block:\n*   **Top Socket:** (10, 9)\n*   **Right Socket:** (11, 14)\n*   **Bottom Socket:** (15, 10)\n*   **Left Socket:** (14, 8)\n\n**2. Identify the Modules and Connectors**\nI will identify each colored shape (module), its connector locations (Red 2s), and where it fits.\n\n*   **Maroon (9) Module:**\n    *   Currently at Top-Left. Connector at (10, 9) matches the Top Socket.\n    *   However, keeping it there leads to crowding and lack of space for other large modules. It can be moved.\n    *   Connector at (10, 9) fits the **Right Socket** (11, 14) if translated.\n    *   Translation: Shift `dy=+1, dx=+5`. New position: Rows 7-11, Cols 13-17.\n\n*   **Green (3) Module:**\n    *   Bottom-Left. Connector at (20, 4) [Right side of shape].\n    *   Fits the **Left Socket** (14, 8) [Left side of Base].\n    *   Translation: Shift `dy=-6, dx=+4`. New position: Rows 14-17, Cols 5-8.\n\n*   **Blue (1) & Orange (7) Modules:**\n    *   These form a vertical pair. Orange has top connectors (20, 12) & (20, 17) separated by 5. Blue has bottom connectors (14, 18) & (14, 23) separated by 5. They lock together.\n    *   The combined unit fits the **Bottom Socket** (15, 10).\n    *   Orange (20, 12) connects to (15, 10).\n    *   Translation (Orange): Shift `dy=-5, dx=-2`. New position: Row 16, Cols 10-15.\n    *   Blue connects to Orange. Translation (Blue): Shift `dy=+1, dx=-3`. New position: Rows 11-15, Cols 15-20.\n\n*   **Shape A (Small 8s) & Shape B (Large 8s):**\n    *   Shape B has a connector at bottom (4, 21). This fits the now-vacant **Top Socket** (10, 9).\n    *   Translation (B): Shift `dy=+6, dx=-12`. New position: Rows 7-10, Cols 4-10.\n    *   Shape A attaches to Shape B. Shape B has a top-right connector at (1, 23) which moves to (7, 11).\n    *   Shape A has a connector at (1, 10). Match (1, 10) to (7, 11).\n    *   Translation (A): Shift `dy=+6, dx=+1`. New position: Rows 7-9, Cols 11-13.\n\n**3. Verify Assembly**\n*   **Top:** Shape B (Cols 4-10) & Shape A (Cols 11-13). Total span 4-13.\n*   **Right:** Maroon (Cols 13-17).\n*   **Bottom:** Orange (Cols 10-15) & Blue (Cols 15-20).\n*   **Left:** Green (Cols 5-8).\n*   **Overlap Check:**\n    *   Shape A (C11-13) vs Maroon (C13-17): Overlap at Col 13. A has `2`,`8`,`8` at C13. Maroon has `0`s at C8 (mapped to C13). No collision.\n    *   Blue (C15-20) vs Maroon (C13-17): Blue is below R11. Maroon ends R11. No vertical overlap.\n    *   Other checks pass.\n\n**4.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n` tags. Let's see...\n\nI'm seeing a consistent pattern across the grids. First, the background is always color 0. That's a simple one. The main thing that sticks out in each grid is a solid, rectangular block, always colored 4. This seems to be the central \"anchor\" or \"hub\". It might be 3x3 or sometimes 5x3, but the block itself is consistently solid.\n\nThen, around this central core, there are these interesting rectangular \"loops\" or \"handles\". They are hollow rectangles - essentially rectangular outlines. The colors of these loops are what vary \u2013 I've seen them as 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  Sometimes, the connections aren't complete loops, and they look more like lines extending from the core.\n\nThe crucial bit, connecting these \"loops\" to the central block, are small single pixels of color 2. These seem to act as the \"joints\" or \"connectors\" between the two. In Grid 4, there is a line of color 7 in the top center. It's a linear segment that extends from the central mass.\n\nSo, it seems to boil down to these fundamental objects: the color 0 background, the solid color 4 block, the color 2 connectors, and the various-colored rectangular/linear shapes. That should cover it. Now, to write this up in a concise way.\n\nHere's my attempt:\n\n```\n<objects_summary> background: color 0; central_core: solid rectangle, color 4; connectors: single pixels, color 2; peripheral_structures: hollow rectangular loops or lines, various colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), connected to core via connectors.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep the color 4 solid rectangle fixed as the anchor. Treat each other colored shape (colors !=0,2,4) together with its adjacent color 2 pixels as a movable module. Translate modules (no rotation/reflection/recolor) so that their color 2 connector patterns overlap matching color 2 connector patterns on the anchor or already placed modules. Overlapping connectors merge as color 2 joints, forming one connected assembled structure; all vacated cells become 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break down this ARC task!** I'm tasked with transforming an input grid into a new output grid, and I've got a couple of solved examples and a test input to work with.  It's clear I need to analyze the input carefully to figure out the rules.\n\nFirst, I looked at **Example 1**.  I saw a central \"anchor\" shape, a 3x3 yellow block, with these red pixels, or \"connectors\". Other shapes were around, and the output had these other shapes attached to the anchor, matching the connectors. So, the output involves assembling the pieces based on where their connector \"plugs\" fit on the anchor.  The red pixels, the \"2s,\" are the key.\n\n**Example 2** showed a similar idea:  an anchor, shapes, red pixels, but the pattern was a little different.  I realized a key thing: the connecting shapes could have connectors on multiple sides and they could connect other shapes together. Shape 6 in Example 2 provides two ports for Shape 8, while on Example 1, each part connected separately to the yellow anchor. I made a more general assembly logic.\n\nThen I moved to the **Test Input**. The process starts with identifying the anchor. Then, identify the other disconnected \"parts.\" Next, I had to map the shapes and find their connectors.  The connectors on the parts have to overlap with the Anchor's connectors or the connectors of a part already attached to the Anchor. I then translate the parts so the connectors overlap, and that's the transform.\n\nI started analyzing the Test Input grid. The anchor looked like a 5x4 block with some red connector pixels. I needed to identify what the shapes were, and find their connection patterns. I saw a maroon shape, a teal shape, a blue shape, a green shape, and an orange shape.\n\nI spent a lot of time trying to match these parts, checking where the red connectors were, and how the parts should be moved. Sometimes I thought a part connected to the anchor directly, and sometimes I saw they needed another piece to create a connection. I had to map the shapes relative to the connector ports, translate it, and see if it merged. It was a process of trial and error and careful observation of the positions of the 2s to check their arrangement. Sometimes the pieces were connected through two points or even had a diagonal connector. Then I started building an assembly instruction.\n\nThe final plan came together after a lot of careful deduction:\n1.  The anchor, the 4-block, remains fixed.\n2.  The green shape moves to the left side and connects.\n3.  The teal shape connects to the top, providing connector ports for the next shape.\n4.  The maroon shape is attached to the teal shape.\n5.  The blue shape attaches to the right.\n6.  The orange shape connects to the blue shape.\n\nNow I need to construct the grid to show the output transformation. I have to carefully draw the parts, using the identified shifts, and place them on the grid.  I need to make sure everything's in the right place, all connectors are properly merged, and the final grid meets all the ARC requirements! I will place each shape based on the connector-based chain that the mapping showed. I will be very careful to keep track of unused connectors too to draw them.\n\nThe process has been complex, requiring me to consider each part carefully and ensure the final grid accurately reflects the input and demonstrates the transform. Let's see if this assembly plan works!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by identifying a central \"anchor\" object and attaching various \"part\" objects to it. The attachment mechanism is based on overlapping \"connector\" pixels (color 2).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:**\n    *   **Anchor:** The central solid block of yellow (4) pixels. It acts as the fixed base. It has several red (2) pixels attached to its perimeter or in its immediate vicinity, acting as \"female\" ports. In the Test Input, the anchor is the 5x3 block of 4s at rows 11-14, cols 9-13. Its ports are at (10,5), (10,7), (10,9), (11,14), (14,8), and (15,10).\n    *   **Parts:** The other colored shapes scattered around the grid. Each part also has red (2) pixels attached to it, acting as \"male\" ports.\n        *   **Shape 9 (Maroon):** Top-left. Ports at (8,3) and (9,4).\n        *   **Shape 8 (Teal):** Top-right. Ports at (0,22), (1,23), (4,21).\n        *   **Shape 1 (Blue):** Middle-right. Ports at (14,18) and (14,23).\n        *   **Shape 3 (Green):** Bottom-left. Port at (20,4).\n        *   **Shape 7 (Orange):** Bottom-right. Port at (20,12).\n\n2.  **Logic & Transformation:**\n    *   We must translate each Part so that its ports overlap with matching ports on the Anchor or on already-attached Parts. The relative geometry of the ports must match perfectly.\n    *   **Matching:**\n        *   **Shape 8 (Teal):** Its port at (4,21) matches the Anchor port at (10,7). The shift is (+6 rows, -14 cols). This places its other ports at (6,8) and (7,9).\n        *   **Shape 9 (Maroon):** Its ports at (8,3) and (9,4) match the *new* ports provided by Shape 8 at (6,8) and (7,9). Shift is (-2, +5).\n        *   **Shape 1 (Blue):** Its port at (14,18) matches the Anchor port at (11,14). Shift is (-3, -4). This moves its other port (14,23) to (11,19).\n        *   **Shape 7 (Orange):** Its port at (20,12) matches the *new* port provided by Shape 1 at (11,19). Shift is (-9, +7).\n        *   **Shape 3 (Green):** Its port at (20,4) matches the Anchor port at (14,8). Shift is (-6, +4).\n\n3.  **Assembly:**\n    *   We reconstruct the grid with the Anchor fixed and all Parts shifted to their new positions. Overlapping ports (2s) merge. Unused ports on the Anchor remain as 2s.\n\n**Output Grid Calculation:**\n*   **Anchor:** (11-14, 9-13) are 4.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n` tags. Let's see...\n\nI'm seeing a consistent pattern across the grids. First, the background is always color 0. That's a simple one. The main thing that sticks out in each grid is a solid, rectangular block, always colored 4. This seems to be the central \"anchor\" or \"hub\". It might be 3x3 or sometimes 5x3, but the block itself is consistently solid.\n\nThen, around this central core, there are these interesting rectangular \"loops\" or \"handles\". They are hollow rectangles - essentially rectangular outlines. The colors of these loops are what vary \u2013 I've seen them as 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  Sometimes, the connections aren't complete loops, and they look more like lines extending from the core.\n\nThe crucial bit, connecting these \"loops\" to the central block, are small single pixels of color 2. These seem to act as the \"joints\" or \"connectors\" between the two. In Grid 4, there is a line of color 7 in the top center. It's a linear segment that extends from the central mass.\n\nSo, it seems to boil down to these fundamental objects: the color 0 background, the solid color 4 block, the color 2 connectors, and the various-colored rectangular/linear shapes. That should cover it. Now, to write this up in a concise way.\n\nHere's my attempt:\n\n```\n<objects_summary> background: color 0; central_core: solid rectangle, color 4; connectors: single pixels, color 2; peripheral_structures: hollow rectangular loops or lines, various colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), connected to core via connectors.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep the color 4 solid rectangle fixed as the anchor. Treat each other colored shape (colors !=0,2,4) together with its adjacent color 2 pixels as a movable module. Translate modules (no rotation/reflection/recolor) so that their color 2 connector patterns overlap matching color 2 connector patterns on the anchor or already placed modules. Overlapping connectors merge as color 2 joints, forming one connected assembled structure; all vacated cells become 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the transformation:**\n\n1. There's a central solid rectangle of color 4 that acts as an anchor (stays fixed)\n2. Various colored shapes (loops/frames) are scattered around with color 2 connectors\n3. The transformation assembles all shapes by moving them so their color 2 connectors overlap with the anchor's connectors or with already-placed shapes' connectors\n\n**Identifying components in the test input:**\n\n- **4 block (anchor):** rows 11-14, cols 9-13, with connectors at (10,9) top, (11,14) right, (14,8) left, (15,10) bottom\n- **9 shape:** rows 6-9, cols 3-7, with connectors at bottom/left\n- **1 shape:** rows 10-13, cols 18-23 (U-frame), with connectors at top/bottom\n- **3 shape:** rows 20-23, cols 1-6, with connectors at top/right/bottom\n- **Small 8 shape:** rows 2-3, cols 10-12, with top connectors\n- **Large 8 shape:** rows 1-4, cols 16-22 (L-shape), with connectors on multiple sides\n- **7 shape:** row 21, cols 12-17 (line), with top connectors\n\n**Calculating shifts to connect shapes:**\n\n1. **9 shape** shifts (+0, +2) \u2192 connector (10,9) overlaps with 4's top\n2. **1 shape** shifts (-3, -4) \u2192 connector (11,14) overlaps with 4's right  \n3. **3 shape** shifts (-7, +2) \u2192 connector (14,8) overlaps with 4's left\n4. **7 shape** shifts (-5, -2) \u2192 connector (15,10) overlaps with 4's bottom\n5. **Small 8** shifts (+16, -3) \u2192 connector (17,7) overlaps with 3's bottom connector\n6. **Large 8** shifts (+3, -1) \u2192 connector (6,15) overlaps with 1's top connector\n\n**Output grid:**\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,2,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n` tags. Let's see...\n\nI'm seeing a consistent pattern across the grids. First, the background is always color 0. That's a simple one. The main thing that sticks out in each grid is a solid, rectangular block, always colored 4. This seems to be the central \"anchor\" or \"hub\". It might be 3x3 or sometimes 5x3, but the block itself is consistently solid.\n\nThen, around this central core, there are these interesting rectangular \"loops\" or \"handles\". They are hollow rectangles - essentially rectangular outlines. The colors of these loops are what vary \u2013 I've seen them as 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  Sometimes, the connections aren't complete loops, and they look more like lines extending from the core.\n\nThe crucial bit, connecting these \"loops\" to the central block, are small single pixels of color 2. These seem to act as the \"joints\" or \"connectors\" between the two. In Grid 4, there is a line of color 7 in the top center. It's a linear segment that extends from the central mass.\n\nSo, it seems to boil down to these fundamental objects: the color 0 background, the solid color 4 block, the color 2 connectors, and the various-colored rectangular/linear shapes. That should cover it. Now, to write this up in a concise way.\n\nHere's my attempt:\n\n```\n<objects_summary> background: color 0; central_core: solid rectangle, color 4; connectors: single pixels, color 2; peripheral_structures: hollow rectangular loops or lines, various colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), connected to core via connectors.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep the color 4 solid rectangle fixed as the anchor. Treat each other colored shape (colors !=0,2,4) together with its adjacent color 2 pixels as a movable module. Translate modules (no rotation/reflection/recolor) so that their color 2 connector patterns overlap matching color 2 connector patterns on the anchor or already placed modules. Overlapping connectors merge as color 2 joints, forming one connected assembled structure; all vacated cells become 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The color **4** solid rectangle is the fixed \u201ccore\u201d. Every other non\u2011background object is a movable **piece**: one connected shape of a single color (not 0/2/4) together with its adjacent **2** cells (connectors).  \nPieces are translated (no rotation/reflection) and **assembled by matching connector pairs**: two pieces connect when each has a pair of 2-cells with the same relative offset (same vector). A piece is moved so that the matching connector pair **overlaps exactly** with the target connector pair (on the core or an already placed piece). All original locations are cleared to 0; overlapping connectors remain color 2.\n\nFor the test, matching connector-pair offsets forces a single chain:\nsmall 8 \u2192 9 \u2192 big 8 \u2192 core(4) \u2192 3 \u2192 1 \u2192 7, and yields the assembled layout below.\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n` tags. Let's see...\n\nI'm seeing a consistent pattern across the grids. First, the background is always color 0. That's a simple one. The main thing that sticks out in each grid is a solid, rectangular block, always colored 4. This seems to be the central \"anchor\" or \"hub\". It might be 3x3 or sometimes 5x3, but the block itself is consistently solid.\n\nThen, around this central core, there are these interesting rectangular \"loops\" or \"handles\". They are hollow rectangles - essentially rectangular outlines. The colors of these loops are what vary \u2013 I've seen them as 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  Sometimes, the connections aren't complete loops, and they look more like lines extending from the core.\n\nThe crucial bit, connecting these \"loops\" to the central block, are small single pixels of color 2. These seem to act as the \"joints\" or \"connectors\" between the two. In Grid 4, there is a line of color 7 in the top center. It's a linear segment that extends from the central mass.\n\nSo, it seems to boil down to these fundamental objects: the color 0 background, the solid color 4 block, the color 2 connectors, and the various-colored rectangular/linear shapes. That should cover it. Now, to write this up in a concise way.\n\nHere's my attempt:\n\n```\n<objects_summary> background: color 0; central_core: solid rectangle, color 4; connectors: single pixels, color 2; peripheral_structures: hollow rectangular loops or lines, various colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), connected to core via connectors.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep the color 4 solid rectangle fixed as the anchor. Treat each other colored shape (colors !=0,2,4) together with its adjacent color 2 pixels as a movable module. Translate modules (no rotation/reflection/recolor) so that their color 2 connector patterns overlap matching color 2 connector patterns on the anchor or already placed modules. Overlapping connectors merge as color 2 joints, forming one connected assembled structure; all vacated cells become 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The color-4 solid rectangle is the fixed \u201canchor\u201d. Every other non\u2011background object is a separate movable piece: it consists of its main color (\u22600,2,4) plus any attached color\u20112 pixels (connectors). Pieces are translated only (no rotation/reflection) and reassembled by making their connector pixels (2) *overlap* with matching connector pixels on the anchor or on already placed pieces. Only 2\u2019s are allowed to overlap; all original (now vacated) cells become 0.\n\nFor the test grid, the connector layouts force a unique assembly:\n- Move the large **8** piece so two of its connectors overlap the anchor\u2019s connectors at (10,9) and (11,14).  \n- Move the **3** piece so its two \u201celbow\u201d connectors overlap the remaining anchor connectors at (14,8) and (15,10).  \n- Attach **1** under **3** by matching the 2\u2011connector pair (spacing 3).  \n- Attach **7** under **1** by matching the 2\u2011connector pair (spacing 5).  \n- Attach **9** to the two remaining connectors of the large **8** (a diagonal pair).  \n- Attach the small **8** under **9** by matching the 2\u2011connector pair (spacing 2).\n\nFinal output grid:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n` tags. Let's see...\n\nI'm seeing a consistent pattern across the grids. First, the background is always color 0. That's a simple one. The main thing that sticks out in each grid is a solid, rectangular block, always colored 4. This seems to be the central \"anchor\" or \"hub\". It might be 3x3 or sometimes 5x3, but the block itself is consistently solid.\n\nThen, around this central core, there are these interesting rectangular \"loops\" or \"handles\". They are hollow rectangles - essentially rectangular outlines. The colors of these loops are what vary \u2013 I've seen them as 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  Sometimes, the connections aren't complete loops, and they look more like lines extending from the core.\n\nThe crucial bit, connecting these \"loops\" to the central block, are small single pixels of color 2. These seem to act as the \"joints\" or \"connectors\" between the two. In Grid 4, there is a line of color 7 in the top center. It's a linear segment that extends from the central mass.\n\nSo, it seems to boil down to these fundamental objects: the color 0 background, the solid color 4 block, the color 2 connectors, and the various-colored rectangular/linear shapes. That should cover it. Now, to write this up in a concise way.\n\nHere's my attempt:\n\n```\n<objects_summary> background: color 0; central_core: solid rectangle, color 4; connectors: single pixels, color 2; peripheral_structures: hollow rectangular loops or lines, various colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), connected to core via connectors.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep the color 4 solid rectangle fixed as the anchor. Treat each other colored shape (colors !=0,2,4) together with its adjacent color 2 pixels as a movable module. Translate modules (no rotation/reflection/recolor) so that their color 2 connector patterns overlap matching color 2 connector patterns on the anchor or already placed modules. Overlapping connectors merge as color 2 joints, forming one connected assembled structure; all vacated cells become 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### Key idea\nColor **2** pixels act as **connectors**. Each non-background object (a connected component of non-zero cells) is moved **only by translation** so that one of its **connector pairs** (two 2\u2019s whose relative offset matches) lands exactly on a matching connector pair already in place. Overlapping connectors merge as color **2**. The solid **4** rectangle is the fixed hub.\n\n### How to place the pieces (test case)\n1. **Keep the 4-rectangle fixed.** Its attached connectors are at:\n   - (11,10), (12,15), (15,9), (16,11)  (row, col)\n\n2. **Big 8-piece \u2192 attach to the hub**  \n   It has a connector pair with the same offset as hub connectors (11,10)\u2192(12,15).  \n   Translate big-8 by **(+7, \u22127)** so its connectors land on **(11,10)** and **(12,15)**.\n\n3. **9-piece \u2192 attach to the moved big-8**  \n   Match its diagonal connector pair to the big-8\u2019s remaining diagonal pair.  \n   Translate 9 by **(\u22121, +12)**.\n\n4. **Small 8-piece \u2192 attach to the 9-piece**  \n   Match its horizontal connector pair to the 9-piece\u2019s bottom connector pair.  \n   Translate small-8 by **(+8, +7)**.\n\n5. **3-piece \u2192 attach to the hub**  \n   Match its connector pair to hub connectors **(15,9)** and **(16,11)**.  \n   Translate 3 by **(\u22126, +4)**.\n\n6. **1-piece \u2192 attach to the 3-piece**  \n   Match its top connector pair to the 3-piece\u2019s remaining connector pair.  \n   Translate 1 by **(+9, \u221213)**.\n\n7. **7-piece \u2192 attach to the 1-piece**  \n   Match its connector pair to the 1-piece\u2019s bottom connector pair.  \n   Translate 7 by **(+3, \u22127)**.\n\n### Output grid\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

I'm not supposed to infer any underlying rules or transformations, just describe the object types themselves.  Also, the colors are limited to numeric values from 0 to 9, and I need to provide a concise summary within the `<objects_summary>` tags. Let's see...\n\nI'm seeing a consistent pattern across the grids. First, the background is always color 0. That's a simple one. The main thing that sticks out in each grid is a solid, rectangular block, always colored 4. This seems to be the central \"anchor\" or \"hub\". It might be 3x3 or sometimes 5x3, but the block itself is consistently solid.\n\nThen, around this central core, there are these interesting rectangular \"loops\" or \"handles\". They are hollow rectangles - essentially rectangular outlines. The colors of these loops are what vary \u2013 I've seen them as 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  Sometimes, the connections aren't complete loops, and they look more like lines extending from the core.\n\nThe crucial bit, connecting these \"loops\" to the central block, are small single pixels of color 2. These seem to act as the \"joints\" or \"connectors\" between the two. In Grid 4, there is a line of color 7 in the top center. It's a linear segment that extends from the central mass.\n\nSo, it seems to boil down to these fundamental objects: the color 0 background, the solid color 4 block, the color 2 connectors, and the various-colored rectangular/linear shapes. That should cover it. Now, to write this up in a concise way.\n\nHere's my attempt:\n\n```\n<objects_summary> background: color 0; central_core: solid rectangle, color 4; connectors: single pixels, color 2; peripheral_structures: hollow rectangular loops or lines, various colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), connected to core via connectors. </objects_summary>\n```\nI think that accurately captures the object types in a concise format, while adhering to the constraints.\n\n\nBased on the provided grids, the objects can be categorized into the following types:\n\n**1. Background**\n*   The grid is primarily composed of empty space represented by **color 0**.\n\n**2. Central Core**\n*   In every grid, there is a central, solid rectangular block made of **color 4**.\n*   The dimensions of this core vary slightly (e.g., a 3x3 square or a 5x3 rectangle).\n\n**3. Peripheral Structures (Loops/Frames)**\n*   Surrounding the central core are distinct distinct rectangular shapes.\n*   These objects are typically \"hollow\" rectangles or open loops (forming shapes like 'O' or 'C') made of single-pixel lines.\n*   Occasionally, these appear as straight lines (e.g., a horizontal bar of **color 7**).\n*   Each peripheral structure is usually monochromatic but distinct from the others in the same grid.\n*   The colors observed for these structures include **color 1**, **color 3**, **color 5**, **color 6**, **color 7**, **color 8**, and **color 9**.\n\n**4. Connectors**\n*   Small, single-pixel objects of **color 2** appear at specific intersection points.\n*   These connectors act as \"joints\" or \"nodes,\" usually positioned directly between the Central Core (**color 4**) and the Peripheral Structures.\n*   They physically link the core to the surrounding loops.\n\n<objects_summary>\nbackground: color 0; central_core: solid rectangle, color 4; connectors: single pixels, color 2; peripheral_structures: hollow rectangular loops or lines, various colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), attached to core via connectors.\n</objects_summary>",

Objects Description\n` tags. Let's see...\n\nI'm seeing a consistent pattern across the grids. First, the background is always color 0. That's a simple one. The main thing that sticks out in each grid is a solid, rectangular block, always colored 4. This seems to be the central \"anchor\" or \"hub\". It might be 3x3 or sometimes 5x3, but the block itself is consistently solid.\n\nThen, around this central core, there are these interesting rectangular \"loops\" or \"handles\". They are hollow rectangles - essentially rectangular outlines. The colors of these loops are what vary \u2013 I've seen them as 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  Sometimes, the connections aren't complete loops, and they look more like lines extending from the core.\n\nThe crucial bit, connecting these \"loops\" to the central block, are small single pixels of color 2. These seem to act as the \"joints\" or \"connectors\" between the two. In Grid 4, there is a line of color 7 in the top center. It's a linear segment that extends from the central mass.\n\nSo, it seems to boil down to these fundamental objects: the color 0 background, the solid color 4 block, the color 2 connectors, and the various-colored rectangular/linear shapes. That should cover it. Now, to write this up in a concise way.\n\nHere's my attempt:\n\n```\n<objects_summary> background: color 0; central_core: solid rectangle, color 4; connectors: single pixels, color 2; peripheral_structures: hollow rectangular loops or lines, various colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), connected to core via connectors.",
                "response": "### Transformations observed (input \u2192 output)\n\n1. **Background preservation**\n   - Color **0** stays as the background.\n   - Any cell not occupied by a moved/kept object in the output becomes **0** (i.e., original object locations are cleared).\n\n2. **Identify and keep the anchor (\u201ccore\u201d) fixed**\n   - The solid rectangular block of color **4** is treated as the central anchor.\n   - In the examples, this **4** rectangle (and its immediately associated connector pixels **2** that already touch it) **does not move**.\n\n3. **Partition the remaining content into movable \u201cmodules\u201d**\n   - Every other non-background structure (colors other than **0**, including the hollow/line shapes in colors like **1,3,5,6,8,\u2026**) is treated as a separate module.\n   - The small connector pixels of color **2** that are attached/adjacent to a module are considered **part of that module** and move with it (unless they are the ones already attached to the fixed **4** core).\n\n4. **Rigid translation of modules (no shape change)**\n   - Each module is moved by **translation only** (shift in row/column).\n   - **No rotation, reflection, scaling, deformation, or recoloring** occurs:\n     - The outline/loop/line geometry stays identical.\n     - The module\u2019s main color (e.g., **1**, **3**, **5**, **6**, **8**, etc.) remains unchanged.\n     - Connector pixels remain color **2**.\n\n5. **Assembly by matching/overlapping connector patterns (color 2)**\n   - Modules are repositioned so that their connector pixels **2** align with (overlap) connector pixels **2** of:\n     - the fixed core (**4**\u2019s connectors), and/or\n     - already-placed modules.\n   - \u201cMatching\u201d is driven by the **connector pattern geometry**, e.g.:\n     - a single **2** matches a single **2**,\n     - a pair of **2** pixels with a specific spacing matches another pair with the same spacing,\n     - vertical-pair matches vertical-pair, horizontal-pair matches horizontal-pair, etc.\n   - The goal is that these aligned **2** pixels become **shared joints** between two structures.\n\n6. **Connector merging/overlap handling**\n   - When two modules (or a module and the core) are placed so that connector pixels coincide, they **merge into one set of pixels**:\n     - the overlapping cell remains color **2** (not duplicated).\n   - Overlap is effectively **allowed/used for color 2** to create joints; the main colored pixels of different modules do not appear to overlap.\n\n7. **Resulting output structure**\n   - The output is a compact, connected assembly centered around the original **4** core position.\n   - All moved modules end up connected through **2**-pixel joints into one connected \u201cnetwork\u201d (chain/tree), while the rest of the grid becomes **0**.\n\n<transformation_summary>\nKeep the color 4 solid rectangle fixed as the anchor. Treat each other colored shape (colors !=0,2,4) together with its adjacent color 2 pixels as a movable module. Translate modules (no rotation/reflection/recolor) so that their color 2 connector patterns overlap matching color 2 connector patterns on the anchor or already placed modules.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n` tags. Let's see...\n\nI'm seeing a consistent pattern across the grids. First, the background is always color 0. That's a simple one. The main thing that sticks out in each grid is a solid, rectangular block, always colored 4. This seems to be the central \"anchor\" or \"hub\". It might be 3x3 or sometimes 5x3, but the block itself is consistently solid.\n\nThen, around this central core, there are these interesting rectangular \"loops\" or \"handles\". They are hollow rectangles - essentially rectangular outlines. The colors of these loops are what vary \u2013 I've seen them as 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  Sometimes, the connections aren't complete loops, and they look more like lines extending from the core.\n\nThe crucial bit, connecting these \"loops\" to the central block, are small single pixels of color 2. These seem to act as the \"joints\" or \"connectors\" between the two. In Grid 4, there is a line of color 7 in the top center. It's a linear segment that extends from the central mass.\n\nSo, it seems to boil down to these fundamental objects: the color 0 background, the solid color 4 block, the color 2 connectors, and the various-colored rectangular/linear shapes. That should cover it. Now, to write this up in a concise way.\n\nHere's my attempt:\n\n```\n<objects_summary> background: color 0; central_core: solid rectangle, color 4; connectors: single pixels, color 2; peripheral_structures: hollow rectangular loops or lines, various colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), connected to core via connectors.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep the color 4 solid rectangle fixed as the anchor. Treat each other colored shape (colors !=0,2,4) together with its adjacent color 2 pixels as a movable module. Translate modules (no rotation/reflection/recolor) so that their color 2 connector patterns overlap matching color 2 connector patterns on the anchor or already placed modules. Overlapping connectors merge as color 2 joints, forming one connected assembled structure; all vacated cells become 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
