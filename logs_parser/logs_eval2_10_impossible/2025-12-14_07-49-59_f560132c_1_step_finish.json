The user wants me to solve it based on a couple of examples. It looks like a pattern recognition problem, so I'm trying to figure out the underlying logic.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Hypotheses:**\n\nMy first thought is, \"Okay, let's break down these examples.\" I start by looking at Example 1. I notice that it's a 20x20 grid with several colored shapes. There's a red \"C\" shape, an orange block, a yellow shape, and a green block. The output is an 8x8 grid. I'm immediately noticing a downscaling operation happening here and the colors are different. I start connecting the dots: \"Input colors are somehow mapped to Output colors. Is there a simple color swap?\" Nope. Instead of focusing on simple transformations, I started to realize there's some kind of structure here.\n\nThe layout of the output gives me a clue: it seems to be quadrants corresponding to the shapes. The Input shapes seem to dictate the colors in output. I'm thinking, \"Is the output a downscaled version with a color mapping?\" No, there seems to be more. I looked closer. It looks like a scaled-up version of something inside the input shapes. I think I see a pattern: the colors inside the red frame are key. So, I realize that the holes inside the red frame are important. Those holes/noise have the values that are used as a mapping key.\n\nFor Example 2, I again analyze the Input and Output grids. This time, the key isn't in the top left, it's somewhere in the center. I see that the mapping is similar. I start noticing the Output colors correspond to colors inside the Key, and their position dictates how shapes are colored.\n\nThe key thing I am realizing is that it's all about **shapes and positions**. I need a way to combine shapes (from all the 4 quadrants) into the output grid.\n\n**Refining the Approach:**\n\nI start thinking \"Ah-ha! Key mapping!\". In both examples, there's a \"Key\" object (a shape with internal values) and other shapes in the different quadrants. I figure that those are the building blocks. I hypothesize, \"The key tells us how to recolor the other shapes!\"\n\nOkay, I need to figure out how the output is arranged. How are these different shapes combined to make the final output grid? I see the shapes are layered.\n\n**Focus on Dimensions & Layout:**\n\nI start to concentrate on grid dimensions. Both inputs are 20x20. But outputs are 8x8 and 10x10. I realized that the Output dimensions are related to the input shape extents. I'm imagining the input as a set of shapes, and the output is a rearrangement of those shapes. \"Do shapes overlap? Are they simply resized? What's the output size?\" I realized that my initial guess about dimensions wasn't correct. I came up with an idea: the \"Key\" object's dimensions dictate the Output. I realized that the Key's frame helps in setting the Output size.\n\n**The Solution Steps (Summarized):**\n\n1.  Identify the 4 main clusters of pixels.\n2.  Find the \"Key\" by identifying unique values inside a 2x2 hole or frame (2x2 of colors). Read those four colors (values).\n3.  Identify the location of the Key, and calculate each object's relationship to the Key's location.\n4.  Each value in the Key tells us which color to replace other clusters' pixels with.\n5.  Output Size depends on Input Extents (Key, and last color object).\n6.  Generate Output Grid.\n7.  Replace all values.\n8.  I will take the shapes from all 4 clusters and, with the key's help, put them together into a final output image.\n\nI'm thinking I've finally got it.  I can solve this! I am ready to move on to the code!\n\n\nTo solve this task, I will apply a transformation based on extracting shapes from the input grid and reassembling them into a new grid according to a specific \"Key\" found in the input.\n\n**Logic:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains four distinct clusters of colored pixels (shapes) against a black (0) background.\n2.  **Locate the Key:** One of these clusters is a \"Key Object\". It is distinguished by being a rectangular frame enclosing a 2x2 area of \"noise\" pixels. These 4 inner pixels are distinct colors and define the color mapping for the output.\n    *   The 2x2 inner region maps the four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) to specific colors:\n        *   `Key[0][0]` (Top-Left value) -> Target Color for the Top-Left Object.\n        *   `Key[0][1]` (Top-Right value) -> Target Color for the Top-Right Object.\n        *   `Key[1][0]` (Bottom-Left value) -> Target Color for the Bottom-Left Object.\n        *   `Key[1][1]` (Bottom-Right value) -> Target Color for the Bottom-Right Object.\n    *   In the Test Input, the Key Object is the Maroon (9) shape in the Top-Left quadrant. Its inner values are:\n        *   Top-Left: 3\n        *   Top-Right: 6\n        *   Bottom-Left: 4\n        *   Bottom-Right: 8\n3.  **Map Objects to Colors:**\n    *   **TL Object** (The Key itself): Maps to Color **3**.\n    *   **TR Object** (Grey 5 shape): Maps to Color **6**.\n    *   **BL Object** (Orange 7 shape): Maps to Color **4**.\n    *   **BR Object** (Red 2 shape): Maps to Color **8**.\n4.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**\n    *   The Output Grid width is the sum of the width of the Key Object's bounding box and the width of the Bottom-Right Object's bounding box.\n        *   Key Width = 10. BR Width = 6. Output Width = 16.\n    *   The Output Grid height is the sum of the height of the Key Object's bounding box and the height of the Bottom-Right Object's bounding box.\n        *   Key Height = 8. BR Height = 4. Output Height = 12.\n    *   Output Size: **16x12**.\n5.  **Construct the Output:**\n    *   **Background:** Fill the entire output grid with the color mapped to the Bottom-Right Object (Color **8**).\n    *   **Draw Bottom-Left Object:** Place the shape of the BL object (recolored to **4**) at the bottom-left of the layout structure, which corresponds to coordinates `(0, Key_Height)`. Crop any parts that fall outside the grid.\n    *   **Draw Top-Right Object:** Place the shape of the TR object (recolored to **6**) at the top-right of the layout structure, which corresponds to coordinates `(Key_Width, 0)`. Crop any parts that fall outside the grid.\n    *   **Draw Top-Left Object:** Place the shape of the TL object (recolored to **3**) at `(0, 0)`. The Key object is treated as a shape where non-zero pixels (frame + inner noise) are solid, and 0s are transparent (revealing the background).\n\n**Test Input Application:**\n\n*   **Output Size:** 16x12.\n*   **Fill:** Color 8.\n*   **Layer 1 (BL Object -> 4):** The Orange shape is placed at `(0, 8)`.\n    *   Row 0 maps to Output Row 8: `4,4,4`.\n    *   Row 1 maps to Output Row 9: `4,4,4`.\n    *   Row 2 maps to Output Row 10: `4,4,4`.\n    *   Row 3 maps to Output Row 11: `4`.\n*   **Layer 2 (TR Object -> 6):** The Grey shape is placed at `(10, 0)`.\n    *   Based on the shape analysis, it draws patterns of 6s on the right side (cols 10-15).\n*   **Layer 3 (TL Object -> 3):** The Maroon Key shape is placed at `(0, 0)`.\n    *   It draws the frame and inner pixels as 3s. Holes in the frame (0s) remain 8s.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,0,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,0,6,6,6,6,0\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,0,6,6,6,6,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,0,0,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,0,0,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,0,0,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,0,0,0,0\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,0,0,0,0\n\nWait, checking the TR object (Grey 5) alignment carefully:\nRow 6 (Input): `...5,5,5...` at indices 19-21.

I'm presented with an ARC task. I need to figure out a pattern based on examples and apply it.  Let's break down the first example.  It's a grid with a bunch of shapes of different colors. The output is smaller, and it looks like a section of the input.  I'm noticing that the colors in the output don't seem to directly correspond to the colors of the main shapes in the input.  Hmm, this is interesting.\n\n**Uncovering the Core Pattern**\n\nI'm drawn to a \"red\" container-like shape in the input, and inside it are smaller colors. Bingo! These smaller, contained colors in the input, specifically their colors, seem to align with the output colors. This suggests the output is generated by focusing on the content *inside* certain input shapes.  The TL shape contains seeds. These seeds get mapped to the 4 quadrants of the output. I also realized that the other regions were not just placed as templates of the colors. \n\n**Mapping the Shapes**\n\nSo, the seed's position determines the destination output region. The shape's color inside that region must be used. Let's start thinking about what is causing each region's shape.  Analyzing the input grid's shapes themselves is key here. The output is also constructed to form some shape! They seem to be combined in a way that relates to the structure of the input, the shape and size.  I notice this might involve a clever rotation to fit within the 8x8 square.\n\n**Refining the Theory and Rotations**\n\nThe \"cycle\" mapping!  Not just which quadrant, but also *rotation*. Examining the Ex 2 case: it seems there's a specific order and some rotation going on.  The order is based on the input TL. What about Ex 2? The Ex 1 is a special case that doesn't follow a pattern, it seems. And Test Inputs will not be the same. The seed of the TL region and its arrangement drives where each element goes, and possibly by what angle or orientation the regions are placed.\n\n**Applying the Theory: Test Input**\n\nI need to apply this to the new test. I am thinking about how to visualize the shapes so they fit together.  Let's start by trying to place the largest shapes first. I'm focusing on the input arrangement to create the correct sized grid. I should check again the input sizes and then think about what the combined grids might look like. I should think about how to map them to an output and their shape.\n\n**Final Grid**\n\nThe logic appears to be to form a grid with parts of the original puzzle fitting. The frame appears to be the most important. The other elements are used to fill out the remaining parts. I have to make a best guess.\n\n\nThe ARC task presents a puzzle where the goal is to transform an input grid into an output grid based on a set of rules inferred from examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Input Segmentation**: The input grid contains four distinct colored clusters (shapes) located roughly in the four quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n    *   In the test input:\n        *   TL Cluster: Maroon (9)\n        *   TR Cluster: Grey (5)\n        *   BL Cluster: Orange (7)\n        *   BR Cluster: Red (2)\n\n2.  **Mapping Logic (Seed)**: Inside the Top-Left cluster (Maroon 9), there is a 2x2 block of \"intruder\" pixels that acts as a key for the output colors.\n    *   Test Input Seed (inside the 9s):\n        ```\n        3 6\n        4 8\n        ```\n    *   This 2x2 seed maps directly to the four quadrants of the output grid:\n        *   Output TL: Green (3)\n        *   Output TR: Magenta (6)\n        *   Output BL: Yellow (4)\n        *   Output BR: Light Blue (8)\n\n3.  **Shape Transformation & Assembly**: The output grid is formed by taking the shapes of the four input clusters and arranging them into a single rectangular block (puzzle fit). The shapes are transformed (moved and potentially rotated) to fit together.\n    *   **TL Input (9) $\\rightarrow$ Output TL (3)**: The TL shape is the \"anchor\" and is not rotated. It forms the left frame. Its shape (widths per row) is `9, 9, 4, 4, 2, 2, 7, 7`.\n    *   **Input BR (2) $\\rightarrow$ Output TR (6)**: Following the cycle pattern from Example 2 (BR $\\rightarrow$ TR), the BR shape (widths `3, 4, 5, 6`) is moved to the Top-Right. It fills the \"gap\" in the TL frame.\n        *   TL Gap at rows 2-5: Widths available are `5, 5, 7, 7`.\n        *   BR Shape `3, 4, 5, 6` fits perfectly into this gap.\n    *   **Input BL (7) $\\rightarrow$ Output BR (8)**: Following the pattern (BL $\\rightarrow$ BR), the BL shape (widths `3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1`) is moved to the Bottom-Right.\n        *   TL Gap at rows 6-7: Widths available are `2, 2`.\n        *   Wait, the TL shape at rows 6-7 has width 7, leaving a gap of 2 (assuming total width 9). The BL shape widths are `3,3...`. This doesn't fit directly.\n        *   However, looking at the assembled shapes in previous examples, the shapes are simply packed. The BL shape corresponds to the seed color 8 (BR position).\n    *   **Input TR (5) $\\rightarrow$ Output BL (4)**: The large shape corresponds to the remaining quadrant.\n\n    **Refined Assembly for Test Input**:\n    The output grid is constructed by taking the Anchor (TL shape, color 3) and filling its negative space with the other shapes.\n    *   **Frame (3)**:\n        Rows 0-1: Full width (9).\n        Rows 2-3: Width 4.\n        Rows 4-5: Width 2.\n        Rows 6-7: Width 7.\n    *   **Gap Filling**:\n        Rows 2-5 (Right side): The BR shape (converted to color 6) fits here.\n        Rows 6-7 (Right side): The remaining gap is small. The BL shape (converted to color 8) is placed here.\n        The layout of the output 8s and 4s is determined by the remaining fit. Given the seed `4 8` at the bottom, and the shapes available, the grid is constructed as a 9x8 block.\n\n**Output Grid Construction**:\n*   **Color 3 (Green)**: Follows the TL input mask.\n*   **Color 6 (Magenta)**: Fills the upper indentation (from Input BR).\n*   **Color 8 (Light Blue)**: Fills the lower indentation (from Input BL).\n*   **Color 4 (Yellow)**: Corresponds to the large input shape, but in the puzzle logic, it fills any remaining large background or is mapped to the specific corner indicated by the seed. In this specific compact puzzle assembly, the primary components are 3, 6, and 8 filling the 9x8 bounds.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,4,4\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4\n3,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,4\n3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 1>\n<CANDIDATE 2>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 22x22\n3333333338888886666666\n3333333338888886666666\n3333888833888866666666\n3333888833888666666666\n3388888833888666666666\n3388888833886666666666\n3333333888886666666666\n3333333888866666666666\n8888888888866666666666\n8888888888666666666666\n8888888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888888\n4444448888888888888888\n4448888888888888888888\n4448888888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_4_step_1\">\n**The Enigmatic ARC Task**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to solve an ARC task, and I'm looking at two example solutions to figure out the underlying logic. It seems we have two inputs, a 20x20 grid, and we need to output an 8x8 grid. The output is a smaller subset of the input data but still relies on it.\n\nLooking at Example 1, there are 4 distinct shapes, each in a different color.  One is especially interesting, it's this weird 'C' shaped thing with other colors inside, it's in the top left. The other three shapes are just blocks.  The output has colors and is a smaller grid. I need to figure out the connection.  It's the interior colors of that top-left shape: 1, 5, 8, 9, arranged as seeds that dictate the arrangement of the output.  The other shapes act as \"masks\" that dictate how the output is formed. They define the shape of regions, kind of.\n\nThe output looks like regions, partitioned using the colors from the red shape.\n\nLet's look closer, I see a pattern: the colors in the output grid are those that were found INSIDE the red shape.\n\nSo here's what I think: The key shape defines the colors and their relative arrangement. The other shapes define some geometry or \"mask\" the background color.\n\nThe output looks like a collision of regions. It seems like the output shapes have some relationship with the mask shapes.\n\nAfter looking at the first example, I'm thinking the colors are determined by the inner colors, but somehow the mask shapes are influencing the output shapes. I need to determine the influence.\n\nExample 2 reinforces the \"Legend\" and \"Mask\" concept. There's a legend shape again, this time magenta, and shapes of gray, maroon, and blue.\n\nThe goal seems to be to figure out the relationship between the colors in the legend, and the positions of the colors in the masks.\n\nNow I'm hypothesizing:  The output is essentially a scaled-up version of the legend's inner pixels, where the positions are influenced by the other shapes (like a Voronoi diagram but with more complex boundaries). The masks appear to influence the geometry of the final output. The boundaries between the output regions seem to be the intersections.\n\nMaybe it's about shape transformations.\n\nThe output size seems related to the bounding boxes of the shapes, it\u2019s all connected.\n\nI'm starting to think about this in terms of applying transformations to the shapes, where the Legend is used to map colors to their positions in the output. The input shapes are transformed and then superimposed to form the output grid.\n\nLet's test by confirming the first example. The Red Shape and its inner colors are acting as a map, telling me where to place things and what colors to use. I take the mask shapes, rotate them, and place them according to the legend's colors.  I think the rotations are the key to unlocking this puzzle.\n\nBased on the shape transformations, it seems that there are 4 main rules. They all relate to geometric transformations.\n\nI think I've cracked it.  It's about placing those shapes in a square grid and letting them collide. But what\u2019s that gap in the grid?  That must be determined by the shape. And if there is any unfilled area, it needs to be filled with something.\nI have a solid understanding of how it all works.\n\nThe solution involves identifying four distinct shapes in the input grid, determining a color mapping from a \"legend,\" transforming the shapes (rotation), and assembling them into a new, smaller grid.\n\n**1. Identify Shapes and Roles**\nThere are four quadrants of shapes in the input grid.\n*   **Top-Left (TL):** A \"Legend\" shape containing distinct inner colors. In the test input, this is the Maroon (9) shape. Inside it are pixels of colors 3, 6, 4, and 8.\n*   **Top-Right (TR):** A shape of a single color. In the test input, this is Cyan (5).\n*   **Bottom-Left (BL):** A shape of a single color. In the test input, this is Orange (7).\n*   **Bottom-Right (BR):** A shape of a single color. In the test input, this is Red (2).\n\n**2. Decode the Legend**\nThe Legend shape (Maroon 9) contains a 2x2 key of inner pixels:\n```\n3 6\n4 8\n```\nThis key maps the position of the input shapes to the colors they will become in the output:\n*   **TL Position** maps to **Color 3**.\n*   **TR Position** maps to **Color 6**.\n*   **BL Position** maps to **Color 4**.\n*   **BR Position** maps to **Color 8**.\n\nAdditionally, the color corresponding to the Bottom-Right shape (Color 8) serves as the **background color** for the output grid, filling any gaps.\n\n**3. Extract and Transform Shapes**\nWe extract the binary mask of each shape (bounding box) and apply specific geometric transformations:\n*   **TL Shape (Source 9 -> Target 3):** No rotation (Identity).\n    *   Input Bounding Box: 10 wide x 8 high.\n*   **TR Shape (Source 5 -> Target 6):** Rotate 90\u00b0 Clockwise.\n    *   Input Bounding Box: 10 wide x 12 high.\n    *   Rotated Size: 12 wide x 10 high.\n*   **BL Shape (Source 7 -> Target 4):** Rotate 90\u00b0 Counter-Clockwise.\n    *   Input Bounding Box: 3 wide x 6 high.\n    *   Rotated Size: 6 wide x 3 high.\n*   **BR Shape (Source 2 -> Target 8):** Rotate 180\u00b0. (This shape is the background color, so it merges with the fill).\n\n**4. Determine Output Grid Dimensions**\nThe output grid is a square. Its width is the sum of the widths of the top-row shapes:\n*   Width = Width(TL) + Width(Rotated TR) = 10 + 12 = **22**.\n*   Height = **22**.\n\n**5. Assemble the Output**\n*   Initialize a 22x22 grid with the background color **8**.\n*   **Place TL Shape (Color 3):** Anchored at (0, 0).\n    *   The shape has \"holes\" (from the 0s in the input loop), which remain as background (8).\n*   **Place TR Shape (Color 6):** Anchored at (0, 10). (Top-Right corner).\n    *   The shape is irregular, so background (8) remains where pixels are missing.\n*   **Place BL Shape (Color 4):** Anchored at (19, 0). (Bottom-Left corner).\n*   (BR Shape is conceptually placed at Bottom-Right, but since it is color 8, it is invisible against the background).\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 2>\n<CANDIDATE 3>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 15x15\n333333333666666\n333333333444666\n333333333444666\n333333333444888\n334444444448888\n334444444488888\n333333344888888\n333333344444444\n444444444444444\n444444444444444\n444444444444444\n444444444444444\n444444444444444\n444444444444444\n444444444444444\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_2_step_1\">\n**ARC Task Strategy: Shape Tiling with Color Mapping**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got to do: The user is challenging me with an ARC task, and my first step is to crack the code by examining a few examples and a test input. It looks like it's a grid puzzle where the input gets transformed into a smaller output. I see shapes and colors involved.\n\nMy thought process is starting with breaking down the shapes from the input grid. I see colorful regions and \"intruder\" pixels within some of them. In the first example, I see a red shape with other colors inside, and then this same arrangement is represented in the output in a smaller way. The intruders are the key. It looks like a mapping is happening. The sizes of the output seems related to the size of the shapes in the input.\n\nIt seems like there's a specific pattern with these \"intruders,\" their positions inside a primary shape (like the red shape in example 1), and their relation to the overall grid and output size. I start thinking this is an arrangement of the shapes. I realize there are shapes that represent the 4 quadrants of the output. The shape dictates the tile of the color in the output. The shapes are rotated, or resized to fit.\n\nAfter analyzing the examples, I can derive a hypothesis: I need to identify a \"Map\" (the shape containing the intruders). Then I check the layout of the other shapes in the input grid.  I need to figure out which position of these objects match the relative location of the intruder. The location of the object defines which color (aka intruder color) will go there.  The shapes are rotated by a certain degree.\n\nI am suspecting the grid is build with 4 shapes that are colored in according to the target colors, or intruder colors.\n\nI figured out a few things. Here's a summary of my transformation:\n\n1.  Find the \"Key Map\" (shape with intruder).\n2.  Find the object shapes that are used in the quadrant of the grid.  A color in the location matches the intruder locations.\n3.  Based on the mapping, I am looking for the tile that will be formed\n4.  Apply rotation (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees)\n5.  Tile the shapes.\n\nWith this knowledge, I can start applying this logic to the test case and build the required output, let's see how it goes.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects and Roles:**\n    *   The input grid contains four main distinct colored objects.\n    *   One of these objects (the **Map Object**) contains \"intruder\" pixels\u2014single pixels of colors different from the object itself.\n    *   The other three objects are solid shapes (or shapes with holes, but no intruders).\n\n2.  **Determine Mappings:**\n    *   The **Map Object** defines the target layout. The positions of the intruder pixels inside the Map Object correspond to the four quadrants of the output grid (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n    *   The **Intruder Colors** determine the color of the region in that quadrant of the output grid.\n    *   The **Source Shapes** for these output regions are the four objects in the input grid.

The goal is to generate a smaller output grid from a larger input grid containing colored regions. The process looks like a partitioning of the input into regions based on the Manhattan distance from key \"seed\" points.\n\nFirst, I identified key patterns: distinct, colored clusters within the input grid, and a consistent output grid filled with a smaller set of colors (no 0s). The hint of four disconnected clusters (seeds) with embedded colors are very important. The output grid size relates to the input, but not always through simple scaling.\n\nI delved into the hints, noting the \"staircase-like\" boundaries, which suggests Manhattan distance (Voronoi) propagation from the \"seed\" clusters to determine each output region. The problem boils down to correctly identifying the seeds and determining the correct size of the output grid.\n\nI recognized the four clusters as the starting points. I saw they had a palette of interior colors. For Example 1, I noted the TL cluster has the \"palette\". In Example 2, the TL cluster has the interior palette. From the palette colors, the quadrant in the Output is color-coded.\n\nThis led me to hypothesize the key to the task: The key is to identify the \"palette\" cluster and then map the quadrent seed cluster. Example 1 showed the output was colored with the interior 2x2.\n\nI need the dimensions of the output grid. In this, I observed the output region colors don't match input colors, which is logical. Using two example output grids, I tried several options for generating the output dimensions, focusing on counts, bounding boxes of colored cells in input, and the gaps between clusters. However, no clear relationship emerged. I made the following hypothesis about how the Output is generated: The input can be \"scaled down\" by a factor of 2. I need to test for the final solution, but for the Test input, the number of columns and rows could be different. I could take a scale of `(W-padding)/2` for width and `(H-padding)/2` for height.\n\nI need to confirm the algorithm. With Test Input, I'll take a BBox size of `22, 21`. I should try a scaled grid of `11x11`.\n\nI must define where these \"seed\" locations should be, on the smaller output grid. My guess is that the centroid scaled down, is the starting point on the scaled grid for each cluster.\n\nThe plan now is:\n1.  **Extract the Palette.** Identify the four color cluster with an embedded palette. Map the palette colors to output regions in a TL-TR-BL-BR fashion.\n2.  **Define Output Grid Size.** Divide the Input Bounding Box by a scale of 2. Use this, combined with padding where necessary.\n3.  **Find Seed Locations.** Based on BBox centroids, scale the coordinates of the cluster centroids relative to the new Output Grid.\n4.  **Perform Voronoi/Growth Simulation**. On the scaled grid, perform Manhattan Distance from these seeds. Generate the output based on this.\n\nI'm ready to begin the test with this plan.\n\nTo solve the test input, for the final output grid, I will generate the Voronoi regions with 11x11, the dimensions. The TL will be green, the TR will be Magenta, the BL will be Yellow, the BR will be Teal. The code will be ready.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a large grid containing four colored clusters into a smaller, fully filled grid partitioned into four regions. The solution involves identifying the \"seeds\", extracting the color palette, determining the output grid dimensions, and generating the partition based on Manhattan distance (growth).\n\n### 1. Identifying Seeds and Palette\nThere are four distinct clusters in the input grid.\n- **Top-Left (TL):** Maroon (9) cluster.\n- **Top-Right (TR):** Grey (5) cluster.\n- **Bottom-Left (BL):** Orange (7) cluster.\n- **Bottom-Right (BR):** Red (2) cluster.\n\nOne of these clusters acts as the \"Palette Cluster\". In the solved examples, this is the cluster containing a 2x2 multicolor pattern embedded within it.\nLooking at the Test Input, the Maroon (9) cluster (TL) contains:\n- Row 5: `... 9, 3, 6, 9 ...`\n- Row 6: `... 9, 4, 8, 9 ...`\nThe embedded palette is:\n```\n3 6\n4 8\n```\nThese colors correspond to the four quadrants of the output relative to the seed positions:\n- **TL Color:** 3 (Green)\n- **TR Color:** 6 (Magenta)\n- **BL Color:** 4 (Yellow)\n- **BR Color:** 8 (Teal)\n\n### 2. Determining Output Dimensions\nIn the examples, the output grid size is approximately half the dimensions of the bounding box of the active input area.\n- **Example 1:** Input BBox ~16x17. Output 8x8. (Scaling factor ~0.5).\n- **Example 2:** Input BBox ~18x18. Output 10x10. (Scaling factor ~0.55).\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- The active clusters span from Column 3 to 24 (Width = 22).\n- They span from Row 4 to 24 (Height = 21).\n- Applying the scaling logic (roughly half):\n  - Width: 22 / 2 = 11.\n  - Height: 21 / 2 = 10.5 -> We will use 11 for a square-ish result, matching the aspect ratio closely. Let's select **11x11** as the output grid size.\n\n### 3. Determining Seed Locations\nWe map the centroids of the input clusters to the new 11x11 grid coordinate system.\n- **TL Cluster:** Centered approx at (7, 7) in input. Relative to BBox origin (3,4): (4, 3). Scaled by 0.5: **(2, 2)**.\n- **TR Cluster:** Centered approx at (21, 11). Relative: (18, 7). Scaled: **(9, 3)**.\n- **BL Cluster:** Centered approx at (4, 21). Relative: (1, 17). Scaled: **(1, 9)**.\n- **BR Cluster:** Centered approx at (19, 21). Relative: (16, 17). Scaled: **(8, 9)**.\n\n### 4. Generating the Partition (Voronoi)\nWe assign each cell in the 11x11 grid the color of the closest seed using Manhattan distance ($|x_1-x_2| + |y_1-y_2|$).\n\n**Seeds:**\n- **3 (Green):** (2, 2)\n- **6 (Magenta):** (9, 3)\n- **4 (Yellow):** (1, 9)\n- **8 (Teal):** (8, 9)\n\n**Boundaries:**\n- **Left vs Right (3 vs 6):** Midpoint $x \\approx 5.5$. Split at index 5/6.\n- **Left vs Right (4 vs 8):** Midpoint $x \\approx 4.5$. Split at index 4/5.\n- **Top vs Bottom (3 vs 4):** Midpoint $y \\approx 5.5$. Split at index 5/6.\n- **Top vs Bottom (6 vs 8):** Midpoint $y \\approx 6.0$. Split at index 6.\n\nThis creates a partition where:\n- **Top-Left** is Green (3).\n- **Top-Right** is Magenta (6).\n- **Bottom-Left** is Yellow (4).\n- **Bottom-Right** is Teal (8).\n\nThe boundaries will be staircase-like due to the discrete Manhattan distance calculations.\n\noutput:\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 12>\n<CANDIDATE 13>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 12x12\n333333666666\n333333666666\n333333666666\n333333666666\n333336666666\n333336666666\n333336666666\n333336666666\n333336666444\n883336664444\n888884444444\n888884444444\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n**Comprehensive Task Analysis and Solution Strategy**\n\nMy primary objective is to solve an ARC task that presents a series of inputs and corresponding outputs, with the goal of generalizing the underlying pattern to a novel input. I've broken this down into several key steps and observations:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Input/Output Relationship:** I start by carefully comparing the dimensions of the input and output grids (e.g., 20x20 input maps to 8x8 or 10x10 outputs). I note that the output size is smaller, suggesting a form of downsampling or a focus on a core region of the input. I also observe the recurring presence of 4 distinct clusters of non-zero pixels within each input.\n2.  **Cluster Identification and Characterization:** The inputs consistently contain 4 clusters. One of these is a \"special\" cluster because it contains pixels of multiple colors. The other 3 are usually uniform in color and form blocks.\n3.  **Special Cluster as the Key:** The most crucial element appears to be the \"special\" cluster. It contains a \"palette\" of colors (e.g., 1, 5, 8, 9). I've noted that the output grid contains pixels from the colors inside the special cluster.\n4.  **Spatial Mapping:** The output regions get assigned colors. The output region colors seem to depend on: the colors found inside the special cluster and which cluster they are found in (TL, TR, BL, BR). This suggests a mapping between the quadrants of the input and the palette color. The output grid shows \"staircase-like\" borders suggesting Manhattan distance or Voronoi diagram.\n5.  **Output Grid Generation:** The critical puzzle lies in how to determine the correct size of the output grid.\n    *   **Area Preservation Hypothesis:** The total number of pixels in the output grid might be equal to the total number of non-zero pixels in the input (Ex: 64 total pixels in Ex 1, which has 64 pixels).\n    *   **The Size Relation:** The relationship between input and output sizes is not linear and cannot be explained by simple ratios. However, some connections can be seen. For example, if you remove rows and cols, Ex 1 Input size 20x20 = output 8x8; Ex 2 input 20x20 = output 10x10. The test input is 26x26. Given the full grid \"constraint\", and pixel preservation, I will need to predict the size.\n6.  **Proposed Algorithm**:\n\n    *   **Cluster Pixel Count:** Compute the pixel count for each input cluster: top left (C1), top right (C2), bottom left (C3), and bottom right (C4).\n    *   **Find Area:** Calculate the sum of the total pixels $A = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4$\n    *   **Dimension Determination**: The total output grid dimensions (W x H) is equal to A.\n    *   **Seed Placement:** The seed locations determine region growth\n    *   **Voronoi Construction:** The main task is constructing a Manhattan distance Voronoi diagram (staircase-like borders).\n    *   **Palette assignment:** Identify the special (multi-colored) cluster and extract the four palette colors (P1, P2, P3, P4). Based on the 4 regions, assign the palette to that region.\n    *   **Final Output:** Produce the output grid using the assigned regions, ensuring that the number of pixels matches the expected pixel count for each color\n\n\nThe solution involves three main steps: identifying the output grid dimensions, determining the mapping from input clusters to output regions, and constructing the final grid based on pixel counts.\n\n**1. Determine Output Grid Dimensions**\nBy analyzing the examples, we find that the total number of non-zero pixels in the input grid equals the total area (number of cells) of the output grid.\n*   **Example 1:** Input pixel count is exactly 64. Output is 8x8 ($8 \\times 8 = 64$).\n*   **Example 2:** Input pixel count is exactly 100. Output is 10x10 ($10 \\times 10 = 100$).\n*   **Test Input:** Counting the pixels in the four clusters:\n    *   Top-Left (9s with inner detail): 52 pixels.\n    *   Top-Right (5s): 62 pixels.\n    *   Bottom-Left (7s): 12 pixels.\n    *   Bottom-Right (2s): 18 pixels.\n    *   **Total:** $52 + 62 + 12 + 18 = 144$.\n    *   Square root of 144 is 12.\n    *   **Output Grid Size:** 12x12.\n\n**2. Determine Color Mapping**\nThe \"special\" cluster (the one containing a multicolored palette) dictates the colors. The mapping rule observed in Example 1 is:\n*   TL Cluster $\\rightarrow$ TL Palette Color\n*   TR Cluster $\\rightarrow$ TR Palette Color\n*   BL Cluster $\\rightarrow$ BR Palette Color (Note the swap)\n*   BR Cluster $\\rightarrow$ BL Palette Color (Note the swap)\n\nFor the Test Input:\n*   **Special Cluster** is the Top-Left one (9s).\n*   **Palette:**\n    *   Row 5: `...9,3,6,9...` $\\rightarrow$ TL=3, TR=6.\n    *   Row 6: `...9,4,8,9...` $\\rightarrow$ BL=4, BR=8.\n*   **Mapping:**\n    *   **TL Cluster** (size 52) $\\rightarrow$ TL Color **3**.\n    *   **TR Cluster** (size 62) $\\rightarrow$ TR Color **6**.\n    *   **BL Cluster** (size 12) $\\rightarrow$ BR Color **8**.\n    *   **BR Cluster** (size 18) $\\rightarrow$ BL Color **4**.\n\n**3. Construct the Grid**\nWe partition the 12x12 grid into 4 regions with sizes matching the cluster pixel counts: Region 3 (52 px), Region 6 (62 px), Region 8 (12 px), Region 4 (18 px).\nThe regions grow from their respective corners (TL, TR, BL, BR) using Manhattan distance logic to form staircase boundaries.\n\n*   **Region 8 (BL, 12 px):** Occupies the bottom-left. A 12-pixel staircase corresponds to the bottom 3 rows of the first 2 columns and bottom 2 rows of the next 3 columns.\n    *   Rows 9-11 in Cols 0-1.\n    *   Rows 10-11 in Cols 2-4.\n*   **Region 4 (BR, 18 px):** Occupies the bottom-right. An 18-pixel staircase corresponds to the bottom 3 rows of the last 4 columns and bottom 2 rows of the preceding 3 columns.\n    *   Rows 9-11 in Cols 8-11.\n    *   Rows 10-11 in Cols 5-7.\n*   **Region 3 (TL, 52 px):** Fills the remaining Top-Left area.\n    *   Fills Cols 0-4 above Region 8.\n    *   Spills into Col 5 (top 4 rows) to reach the count of 52.\n*   **Region 6 (TR, 62 px):** Fills the remaining Top-Right area.\n    *   Fills Cols 6-11 above Region 4.\n    *   Fills Col 5 (middle rows) to reach the count of 62.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,4,4\n8,8,3,3,3,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 13>\n<CANDIDATE 14>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 12x12\n333333666666\n333333666666\n333333666666\n333333666666\n333333666666\n333366666666\n433336666666\n433336666668\n433336666688\n443336668888\n444336688888\n444436888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_5_step_5_generate_hint\">\nLooking at this ARC task, I need to understand the transformation from the examples:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**Key observations:**\n1.

After reviewing example 1 and the test input, I've figured out the core principle: we're dealing with a \"collage\" or \"layering\" of image objects within a grid, but not in a simple way. The input objects are assigned to quadrants, and their colors are defined by a container object in the input grid. I will need to predict the output image.\n\n**Key Observations and Rules:**\n\n1.  **Object Roles:** The input objects function as image \"paint buckets\". In the ARC task, we divide the output into quadrants. The container's internal structure and seeds determine the layout and color.\n\n2.  **Output Size:** The output size isn't directly related to container size. The output width is equal to the bounding boxes of the objects on the top row; the output height is the sum of the bounding box of the top object and bottom objects. In some cases, the height may be truncated.\n\n3.  **Color Determination:** The output regions are filled by colors from internal elements of the container. Inside the Container object are 2x2 or 4 Seed pixels representing colors. A seed color is assigned to each quadrant.\n\n4.  **Layout:** The Input grid will be divided into 4 quadrants. Each output grid Quadrant will be assigned to colors by its seeds. The size of the objects in the other quadrants will be assigned to determine the output grid, the grid may be clipped/reduced.\n\n    *   **TL** (Top-Left): Shape determined by the Container Mask. Color from the TL seed in the container.  It also fills the empty space in the TL quadrant.\n    *   **TR** (Top-Right): Shape of Object, Color from TR seed in container. Placed adjacent to TL, right-aligned to the container.\n    *   **BL** (Bottom-Left): Shape of object, Color from BL Seed from Container. Placed below TL, Left aligned.\n    *   **BR** (Bottom-Right): Shape of object, Color from BR Seed from Container. Aligned to the BL object, the bottom right-aligned to BL and the right edge of TR.\n\n5.  **Overlay:** The TL shape is usually on top. The background is the BR object, which is \"invisible\" to the eye.\n\n**How to solve a new task:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the container object and the other 3 objects. Check the container for the colors. Identify the seed color for each quadrant.\n\n2.  **Determine Output Size:**  Calculate width. The Grid Width=TL.W + TR.W\n    Calculate height: H=TL.H + BL.H.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Place the background object at 0 in the TL region.\n    *   Draw the TL object in the TL region.\n    *   Draw the TR object by positioning it adjacent to the TL object on the right side.\n    *   Draw the BL object below and aligned to TL, and use any space below TL to draw the shape.\n    *   Draw the BR object below and right of BL.\n\nNow, let's start coding this up.\n\n\nTo solve the ARC task, I have analyzed the solved examples and the test input to deduce the underlying transformation rule.\n\n**Reasoning Summary:**\n1.  **Input Decomposition:** The input grids contain a \"Container\" object (identified by having specific \"noise\" pixels inside it) and three other distinct colored objects. The spatial arrangement of these four objects corresponds to four quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n2.  **Seed Mapping:** The \"noise\" pixels inside the Container form a 2x2 pattern of \"Seeds\". These seeds define the **Color** to be used for the corresponding quadrant in the output grid.\n    *   TL Seed -> Color for TL Region.\n    *   TR Seed -> Color for TR Region.\n    *   BL Seed -> Color for BL Region.\n    *   BR Seed -> Color for BR Region.\n3.  **Geometry and Layout:** The Output Grid is a composition of the shapes (masks) of the four input objects.\n    *   The grid is divided into four regions. The dimensions of the regions are determined by the bounding boxes of the input objects.\n    *   Specifically, the **TL Object** (which is also the Container) sets the width of the left column (`W_left`) and the height of the top row (`H_top`).\n    *   The **TR Object** sets the width of the right column (`W_right`).\n    *   The **BL Object** sets the height of the bottom row (`H_bottom`).\n    *   **Output Grid Size:** Width = `W_left` + `W_right`. Height = `H_top` + `H_bottom`.\n4.  **Drawing Rule:** For each quadrant, the mask of the corresponding source object (its non-zero pixels within its bounding box) is drawn in the corresponding region's specific color.\n    *   **Background:** The background of the output grid is filled with the color of the **BR Seed**. Any \"empty\" space in the object masks (pixels that were 0 in the input bounding box) takes this background color.\n    *   **Mask Application:**\n        *   TL Region (at `0,0`): Draws TL Object Mask in TL Seed Color.\n        *   TR Region (at `W_left, 0`): Draws TR Object Mask in TR Seed Color.\n        *   BL Region (at `0, H_top`): Draws BL Object Mask in BL Seed Color.\n        *   BR Region (at `W_left, H_top`): Draws BR Object Mask in BR Seed Color.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Objects & Seeds:**\n    *   **Container (TL Object):** Maroon shape. Bounding Box: 10x8 (Width 10, Height 8).\n        *   Inside Seeds: Green (3), Magenta (6), Yellow (4), Teal (8).\n        *   **TL Seed:** Green (3).\n        *   **TR Seed:** Magenta (6).\n        *   **BL Seed:** Yellow (4).\n        *   **BR Seed:** Teal (8).\n    *   **TR Object:** Gray shape. Bounding Box: 10x12 (Width 10). (Cropped to fit canvas or canvas expands? Based on Ex 1, top row height is fixed by TL Object height. We use `H_top = 8`). Mask is taken from the first 8 rows of the Gray object.\n    *   **BL Object:** Orange shape. Bounding Box: 3x6 (Width 3, Height 6).\n    *   **BR Object:** Red shape. Bounding Box: 6x4 (Width 6, Height 4).\n*   **Dimensions:**\n    *   `W_left` = 10 (from TL).\n    *   `W_right` = 10 (from TR).

The instructions are initially confusing, with contradictions about whether to provide an explanation or just the final grid. However, after careful consideration of the system and user prompts, I've determined that providing both a detailed explanation and the output grid is the intended behavior. The key is to analyze the relationship between input shapes, their positions, and the resulting output grid.\n\nI start by meticulously examining the provided examples. The puzzle seems to involve extracting and transforming shapes from the input grid and arranging them in a predictable manner on the output canvas. I identify the \u201cKey\u201d shape (often containing a unique arrangement of colors) as a central element. This key, typically in the top-left quadrant, dictates the mapping of shapes to colors, effectively linking the quadrants to the output grid's arrangement. The output\u2019s dimensions are calculated from the combined size and transformation of these component shapes.\n\nEach shape in the original grid is extracted and its spatial transformation is assessed. These shapes are then placed onto the final canvas, which has a size that\u2019s a combination of these transformations. For example, if the top-right needs to be rotated 90 degrees, its original height, after the rotation, becomes the width that\u2019s added to calculate the total output width. The overlapping colors determine which colour shows in the output grid.\n\nThe goal is to generate an output grid and to reconstruct the solution logic. In the test input, I break down the task into smaller steps:\n\n1.  **Identify quadrants:** divide the input grid into four quadrants, each containing a main object.\n2.  **Locate the Key:** Find the shape that includes a set of distinctive colours (3, 6, 4 and 8 in the test input). The values within it map to corresponding quadrants.\n3.  **Establish Transformation Logic:** Determine the specific spatial rotation (often 90 degrees) for each shape.\n4.  **Calculate the Canvas Size:**  I calculate the output width by adding width of the top-left shape with height of the top-right shape, and the height with adding the height of the top-left with height of the bottom-left.\n5.  **Translate Shapes to Colors:** Use the colour key (quadrants mapped to shapes) to find the correct colors.\n6.  **Recreate the Output Grid:** Create the final output grid, placing the shapes on the defined grid.\n\nApplying this logic to the test input, I generate the output grid by correctly placing each transformed input shape and assign the correct colour to it. I carefully assess the rotations and positions to ensure that they are in line with the logic derived from the examples and the overall instructions of the ARC puzzle.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples, the transformation follows a hierarchical logic:\n1.  **Decomposition:** The input grid is divided into four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). Each quadrant contains a distinct \"foreground\" object.\n2.  **Key Extraction:** One of the objects acts as a \"Key Holder\" (identifiable by containing a 2x2 arrangement of four distinct \"intruder\" colors). The spatial arrangement of these intruder colors defines the coloring of the output objects.\n    *   Top-Left Intruder -> Color for the Top-Left Object.\n    *   Top-Right Intruder -> Color for the Top-Right Object.\n    *   Bottom-Left Intruder -> Color for the Bottom-Left Object.\n    *   Bottom-Right Intruder -> Color for the Bottom-Right Object.\n3.  **Transformation & Assembly:** The output grid is constructed by transforming and assembling the four objects:\n    *   **Canvas Size:** The output width is the sum of the width of the TL object and the *height* of the TR object (implying 90\u00b0 rotation). The output height is the sum of the height of the TL object and the height of the BL object.\n    *   **Top-Left (TL) Object:** Copied as-is (no rotation) to the top-left corner (0,0). Colored with the TL-key color.\n    *   **Top-Right (TR) Object:** Rotated 90\u00b0 Clockwise and placed adjacent to the right of the TL object. Colored with the TR-key color.\n    *   **Bottom-Left (BL) Object:** Copied as-is (no rotation) and placed adjacent below the TL object. Colored with the BL-key color.\n    *   **Bottom-Right (BR) Object:** Rotated 90\u00b0 Clockwise and placed in the bottom-right corner of the canvas. Colored with the BR-key color. Priority is given to this object in case of overlaps (inferred from Example 1).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **TL Object:** Maroon shape (containing Key). Shape is a 10x8 rectangle. Key colors: 3 (TL), 6 (TR), 4 (BL), 8 (BR). **Output TL:** Color 3 (Green), Size 10x8.\n*   **TR Object:** Grey shape. A \"tree\" pointing up (Stem 2px wide, Cap triangle). Bounding box 10x12. **Output TR:** Rotated 90\u00b0 CW (pointing right). Color 6 (Pink). Position starts at column 10.\n*   **BL Object:** Orange shape. A \"flag\" (3x6). **Output BL:** Color 4 (Yellow). Position starts at row 8.\n*   **BR Object:** Red shape. A right triangle (6x4). **Output BR:** Rotated 90\u00b0 CW. Color 8 (Teal). Positioned in the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 19>\n<CANDIDATE 20>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 12x12\n333333333366\n333333333366\n333366663366\n333366663366\n336666663366\n336666666666\n333333366666\n333333366666\n444666666666\n444466666888\n444446668888\n444444688888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\nLooking at this ARC task, I need to understand the transformation from the examples:\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.

The goal is to take a grid of numbers and output a smaller, dense grid with the zeros removed. The key is in understanding how to find and recombine \"unique container objects,\" which seem to involve a 2x2 mosaic of distinct colors.\n\nSo, first thing's first, I gotta define the process. I see that the input grids use numbers from 0-9. The output is a smaller grid without zeros. Based on the instructions and the examples, I see I need to do a few things:\n1.  **Identify a unique \"container object.\"** This object will surround a 2x2 block of four different numbers (let's call them colors). I need to extract these colors (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) from the block.\n2.  **Combine the container and its contents**. I need to merge the shapes of this \"container\" (the object) with the enclosed content, and then re-color it all with the color from the top-left of the 2x2 mosaic. This becomes the \"TL piece.\"\n3.  **Find the other objects.** Identify all the distinct, connected objects in the input.\n4.  **Order by size.** Sort these other objects by their area (number of pixels). Assign them new \"keys\" based on their size: the smallest object becomes the BL key, the middle the TR key, and the largest the BR key.\n5.  **Calculate the output size.** Determine N by finding the square root of the total non-zero input pixels, and build an N x N grid.\n6.  **Tessellate the grid.** Finally, I take the newly created TL, TR, BL, and BR shapes, and arrange them to fill an N x N square, allowing for rotations or translations if needed to make them fit.\n\nLet's verify this logic against the examples.\n\n**Examining Example 1:**\nI'm looking at the first example to validate my thought process. There's a red shape (color 2) that contains what looks like that 2x2 \"mosaic.\" Rows 2 and 3 contain:\n```\n2 1 5 2\n2 8 9 0\n```\nSo, the 2x2 mosaic is the numbers:\n```\n1 5\n8 9\n```\nKeys: TL=1, TR=5, BL=8, BR=9.\nThe container is the red shape around that mosaic (color 2). I combine these to make a 1 region after re-coloring. Let's count it out: if I re-color the container, plus all contained pixels, there are about 15 pixels in total. It becomes a 5x5 block with a bite taken out, 15 pixels. So if I re-color the container to TL key (1), I should get a region of 1's of that shape.\nThe other objects are an orange shape (7) of size 12, a Yellow shape (4) with area 27, and a Green shape (3) with an area 11.\nSorting by area:\nGreen (3) = 11 (BL key 8).\nOrange (7) = 12 (TR key 5).\nYellow (4) = 27 (BR key 9).\n\nTotal count is 15+11+12+27 = 65 pixels.\nIs the output 8x8? Yes. It's 64.  So there is one extra pixel! After re-counting, I see that the object area calculations are slightly off. It's 15+11+12+26 = 64 pixels exactly. The output shape is 8x8 exactly. I now have confidence this works.\n\nThe tessellation places a color 1 object (red shape plus inclusions).\n\nSo, the next step is now to apply this knowledge to the input grid.\n\n**Applying the Logic to the Test Input:**\nI'm looking for this 2x2 mosaic in the provided input grid. I see:\n```\n...9,3,6,9...\n...9,4,8,9...\n```\nAh! There's my mosaic, the numbers 3, 6, 4, and 8. The container, which encloses this 2x2 block, is the '9' shape.  Let's work through it.\nKeys: TL = 3, TR = 6, BL = 4, BR = \n\nTo solve the ARC task, I will identify the objects in the input grid, determine their roles based on the transformation rules (Container, TL/TR/BL/BR pieces), and construct the output grid by tessellating these objects.\n\n**1. Analyze the Input Objects**\nThe input grid contains four distinct connected components (objects) on a background of 0:\n*   **Object A (Key 9):** A large shape constructed of 9s, containing a 2x2 mosaic of distinct colors (3, 6, 4, 8) at `input[5][4]`, `input[5][5]`, `input[6][4]`, `input[6][5]`.\n    *   **Mosaic Colors:** Top-Left (TL)=3, Top-Right (TR)=6, Bottom-Left (BL)=4, Bottom-Right (BR)=8.\n    *   **Role:** This is the **Container**. According to the rules, it merges with its inclusions. We treat the container shape as the mask of the 9s plus the inclusions.\n    *   **Color Assignment:** Merged object becomes the **TL Key Color (3)**.\n    *   **Shape:** It occupies rows 4-11 and columns 3-12 (approx). We will extract its exact mask.\n\n*   **Object B (Key 5):** A very large connected region of 5s.\n    *   **Area:** Count of pixels is 62.\n    *   **Role:** Largest of the non-container objects -> **BR Key Color (8)**.\n\n*   **Object C (Key 2):** A triangle-like shape of 2s.\n    *   **Area:** Count of pixels is 18.\n    *   **Role:** Middle area -> **TR Key Color (6)**.\n\n*   **Object D (Key 7):** A rectangular/L-shape of 7s.\n    *   **Area:** Count of pixels is 12.\n    *   **Role:** Smallest area -> **BL Key Color (4)**.\n\n**2. Transformation Logic**\n*   **Grid Size:** Total non-zero pixels = 52 (Container) + 62 (Fives) + 18 (Twos) + 12 (Sevens) = 144. Output size is $\\sqrt{144} = 12 \\times 12$.\n*   **Target Layout:**\n    *   **TL Quadrant:** Container Shape (Color 3).\n    *   **TR Quadrant:** Twos Shape (Color 6).\n    *   **BL Quadrant:** Sevens Shape (Color 4).\n    *   **BR Quadrant:** Fives Shape (Color 8).\n    *   The objects must tessellate (fit together without overlap or gaps) to form the 12x12 square. Rotations are allowed.\n\n**3. Tessellation Strategy**\n*   **Container (Color 3):** Placed at (0,0). It occupies the top-left heavily. Its shape has a \"bite\" taken out of the right side and bottom.\n*   **Twos (Color 6):** The input shape is a right triangle. Rotating it 180 degrees allows it to fit perfectly into the \"bite\" on the right side of the Container (rows 2-5).\n*   **Sevens (Color 4):** The input shape is a 3x6 block (top half 3-wide, bottom half 1-wide). Rotating it 90 degrees counter-clockwise creates a shape that fits into the bottom-left corner (rows 9-11), interlocking with the empty space left by the Container and the background.\n*   **Fives (Color 8):** This object fills the remaining space (Bottom-Right and gaps). Its large area (62) covers the BR quadrant and flows into the remaining gaps at the top-right and between the other shapes.\n\n**4. Constructing the Output Grid**\nWe initialize a 12x12 grid with Color 8 (Background/Fives), then overlay the other three shapes.\n\n*   **Layer 1 (Background):** Fill 12x12 with **8**.\n*   **Layer 2 (TL - Container):** Draw Color **3** based on the container mask at offset (0,0).\n    *   Rows 0-1: Cols 0-9.\n    *   Row 2-3: Cols 0-3, 8-9.\n    *   Row 4: Cols 0-1, 8-9.\n    *   Row 5: Cols 0-1.\n    *   Rows 6-7: Cols 0-6.\n*   **Layer 3 (TR - Twos):** Draw Color **6** (rotated 180\u00b0) into the container's cavity.\n    *   Row 2: Cols 5-7.\n    *   Row 3: Cols 4-7.\n    *   Row 4: Cols 3-7.\n    *   Row 5: Cols 2-7.\n*   **Layer 4 (BL - Sevens):** Draw Color **4** (rotated 90\u00b0 CCW) at the bottom left.\n    *   Row 9: Cols 0-2.\n    *   Row 10: Cols 0-2.\n    *   Row 11: Cols 0-5.\n\nAll remaining pixels stay **8**.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,6,6,6,3,3,8,8\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8\n3,3,8,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8\n3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,6,6,6,3,3,8,8\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8\n3,3,8,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8\n3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 24>\n<CANDIDATE 25>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 12x12\n333333333366\n333333333366\n333366663366\n333366663366\n338888883366\n338888888866\n333333388888\n333333388888\n444888888888\n444888888888\n444888888888\n444888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n**Algorithm Discovery and Refinement**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The core is to map shapes onto a new grid. I need to take the input and transform it into a well-defined output, based on a few rules and examples.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input and break it down. It's a grid with shapes of different colors, on a black background. The output is a smaller solid grid with tessellated shapes. I've got two examples to guide me. I noticed I need to identify the objects by color and shape. There's a special object to start with: the container object, which encloses a 2x2 mosaic of distinct colors. Inside, the container's the shape formed by the enclosing color, plus the inner colors. I'm calling the colors inside \"keys\".\n\nThe task seems to be about decomposing the input into parts, re-coloring those parts, and then fitting them into a new grid. This involves shape extraction, area calculation, sorting, and geometric placement. Based on the examples, I know that the areas of shapes need to be computed and then used for the final structure. The largest shapes are used for anchor positions and the smaller shapes are placed around them. I can assume the final structure is a regular square shape, that's being created by tessellation.\n\nThe \"container\" object is special. It's identified by its enclosed mosaic. So I need to go through the objects in the input, find one with a mosaic inside, and assign it a color based on the top-left key color in the mosaic.\n\nThe \"other\" objects are sorted by their area. Smallest -> Bottom-Left. Middle -> Top-Right. Largest -> Bottom-Right. The final output is formed by tessellating these pieces. So, I must extract the 4 shapes and map them to keys, using the calculated area.\n\nThe tessellation part is about fitting the transformed shapes into the final square. Based on examples, I need to fit the new colors into corners of the grid. It's about combining colors and shapes together to form the new square. The examples tell me that the shapes will be translated, and potentially rotated to fit.\n\nFor the new shapes, I can visualize this as a mapping operation from the source shapes to a new set of shapes on the new grid. I then need to place them in the correct quadrant/corner based on their calculated areas and color assignments, from the key colors.\n\nSo, I need to:\n1.  Parse Input to extract all shapes and colors.\n2.  Find the mosaic container. Get the keys. Merge this shape.\n3.  Calculate Areas. Sort Shapes by Area. Assign Quadrants.\n4.  Generate Output Grid by filling the quadrants with the final shapes.\n\nBased on the prompt's hint \"TL piece at top-left, TR piece at top-right...\", that suggests a fixed top-left placement. The shapes might have to be rotated.\nI'm ready to apply this to the new test input. Let's start with parsing the shapes and object area calculations.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the input and the transformation rules derived from the examples:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects & Keys**:\n    *   **Object A**: The large maroon container (color 9) with inclusions (3, 6, 4, 8).\n        *   Mosaic colors: TL=3 (Green), TR=6 (Magenta), BL=4 (Yellow), BR=8 (Teal).\n        *   Container A merges with inclusions and takes the **TL Key (3, Green)**.\n        *   Area of A: ~52 pixels.\n    *   **Object B**: The large grey object (color 5). Area ~62 pixels.\n        *   Largest of the other three -> **BR Key (8, Teal)**.\n    *   **Object D**: The red object (color 2). Area 18 pixels.\n        *   Middle sized -> **TR Key (6, Magenta)**.\n    *   **Object C**: The orange object (color 7). Area 12 pixels.\n        *   Smallest -> **BL Key (4, Yellow)**.\n\n2.  **Determine Output Size**:\n    *   Total Area = 52 + 62 + 18 + 12 = 144 pixels.\n    *   Output Grid is $\\sqrt{144} \\times \\sqrt{144} = 12 \\times 12$.\n\n3.  **Tessellation**:\n    *   **TL (Green, 3)**: Corresponds to Object A. It is placed in the top-left. Its shape (width 10, height 8 with gaps) anchors the tessellation.\n    *   **TR (Magenta, 6)**: Corresponds to Object D.

The goal is to transform one grid into another. Let's analyze the first example.\n\nI started by looking at the input and output grids. The input has four distinct shapes, each with a different color. The output is smaller and seems to be a combination of colored regions. The output colors (1, 5, 8, 9) correspond to specific pixels within the input grid's top-left shape (red, in this case). The arrangement of these colors in the input seems to relate to the positions of the shapes on the larger grid.\n\nInitially, I thought the output shapes were scaled-up versions of the input shapes. However, they don't exactly match. The shapes in the output seem to be \"pasted\" together to form an 8x8 grid. There's a mapping: input shape to output region, and the color of each output region is determined by the \"code\" inside the red shape.  The output grid is a puzzle of these colored regions. The colors seem to be based on a 2x2 block within the red shape, with their positions indicating which shape gets which color.  The task involved a transformation where the shapes were reorganized and the colors were replaced by the \"code\" pixels.\n\nI then moved onto the second example. The shapes were in different colors and positions, but the basic idea remained the same: input shapes transformed into output regions based on a 2x2 \"code\" block inside the top-left shape. I noticed the output size was 10x10, the input was 20x20. I began to form a hypothesis: could the input shapes be scaled by a factor of 2?  In other words, a 2x2 block of input pixels becomes one pixel in the output. I tried testing this theory, but quickly realized it didn't fully explain the transformations. The sizes and number of pixels in the input and output shapes didn't proportionally align with the 2x2 to 1x1 scaling hypothesis.\n\nIt seemed like the task required removing the empty space.  In Ex 2, there was an irregular shape (grey) that was not a perfect rectangle, so the scaling wasn't a simple ratio. Removing the black space still left the input grid size to be something other than the output grid size. Also the shapes in the inputs had \"holes\" (such as the pink shape in Example 2 which contained the code pixels). But in the outputs, those holes where replaced by the solid color of the shape, or code's color.\n\nMoving to the test input, and reexamining how the 2x2 block related to the shape position and corresponding colors.  I confirmed the color assignment logic. The shapes in the output seemed to be a collage of the shapes. \n\nI discarded simple rules about scaling or rotation and instead focused on bounding boxes.  By bounding boxes, I mean that the output had dimensions to fit the input shapes' combined area, and that the shapes filled the space perfectly in the output.\n\nAfter further analysis, I began to think the output grid was a transformed, possibly resized version of the input layout.  The shapes might be simply moved and re-sized to fit together, and the output colors depend on the mapping from those 2x2 code pixel blocks.\n\nI identified the key aspects.  I believed the output size might be derived from a relationship between the \"code block,\" or sum of widths and heights or some combination of dimensions. The canvas size of the output might be related to the source dimensions, possibly the combined size or bounding box size of the shapes. This lead to trying different calculations of bounding box dimensions and relating them to each example's sizes.\n\nI needed an example of how the shapes would be joined in the output. I also realized that some shapes had similar pixel structure, such as the two shapes resembling an \"L\" shape. After calculating the dimension of bounding boxes and adding to create the output dimensions, I came to the conclusion, I could map the shapes from the input to the output.\n\nI hypothesized there was a specific transformation rule. I concluded the output was a collage of the four input shapes. I considered removing empty rows/cols in the input to produce an output grid. I had to solve a series of examples, so I could use them to test the output's size.  I deduced that the output size was half of the input size: 26 -> 13.\nI created a plan to construct a 20x20 output grid.\n\nI decided that, since the inputs have gaps, and the output is a closed block, I needed to fill the gaps. The gaps between the shapes were an important detail. I hypothesized that the final shape would be a collage with the code colours within the shapes. I concluded that I needed to\n\nThe problem asks us to transform an input grid containing four colored shapes into a smaller output grid composed of four colored regions. The transformation involves three main steps: determining the output colors, determining the output grid size, and mapping the shape geometries.\n\n**1. Color Mapping Strategy**\nIn each example, the top-left \"container\" shape holds a 2x2 block of \"code\" pixels that dictate the color palette for the output.\n*   **Example 1:** The Red (2) container has inner pixels: `1, 5` (top row) and `8, 9` (bottom row).\n    *   Top-Left (TL) shape maps to Top-Left code color: Red shape -> **1 (Blue)**.\n    *   Top-Right (TR) shape maps to Top-Right code color: Orange shape -> **5 (Grey)**.\n    *   Bottom-Left (BL) shape maps to Bottom-Left code color: Yellow shape -> **8 (Teal)**.\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR) shape maps to Bottom-Right code color: Green shape -> **9 (Maroon)**.\n\n*   **Example 2:** The Pink (6) container has inner pixels `2, 4` and `8, 3`.\n    *   TL Pink shape -> **2 (Red)**.\n    *   TR Grey shape -> **4 (Yellow)**.\n    *   BL Maroon shape -> **8 (Teal)**.\n    *   BR Blue shape -> **3 (Green)**.\n\n*   **Test Input:** The Maroon (9) container has inner pixels `3, 6` and `4, 8`.\n    *   TL Maroon shape -> **3 (Green)**.\n    *   TR Grey shape -> **6 (Pink)**.\n    *   BL Orange shape -> **4 (Yellow)**.\n    *   BR Red shape -> **8 (Teal)**.\n\n**2. Geometry and Grid Size**\nThe output grid appears to be constructed by removing the empty rows and columns that separate the four shapes in the input grid. This effectively \"squeezes\" the shapes together.\n*   **Test Input Analysis:**\n    *   **Columns:** The TL and BL shapes occupy columns 3-12 (width 10). The TR and BR shapes occupy columns 16-25 (width 10). There is a gap of 3 columns (13-15).

My focus is on understanding the underlying logic to generate the output from the input.\n\n**Initial Impressions:**\n\n*   I need to analyze how the input grid is transformed into the output grid.\n*   Two examples are given to provide hints for solving a single test case.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\n*   The input grid is divided into four regions containing distinct shapes (shapes 2, 7, 4, and 3).\n*   There's a special object containing a key (a 2x2 block with unique colors).\n*   The output grid contains solid shapes of unique colors.\n*   The \"key\" likely drives how shapes are translated to the colors of the output, but the exact mapping is unclear.\n*   The shapes in the output grid appear to correspond to solidified versions of the input shapes.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n\n*   I'll identify the four main input shapes.\n*   Figure out the output color of each region based on the position of each shape relative to the key inside the special TL shape.\n*   The \"key\" pixels in the special object determine the output color of each shape based on its location in the input.\n*   Each output region's color matches a color in the key object's 2x2 block.\n\n**Testing Hypothesis:**\n\n*   I need to check how the input shapes map to the output shapes and colors.\n*   I'll analyze the shapes and their bounding boxes and see if there are any rotations or translations applied.\n*   I realize that the shapes appear to be **packed** into the output grid.\n*   The output grid's size isn't obviously the sum of input shapes, but they touch to fill the 8x8 space.\n\n**Refining Logic:**\n\n*   I'll need to figure out how to arrange the shapes based on the color mapping. The shapes' positions in the output seem tied to the shapes' relative position with respect to the key in the input.\n*   The size of the output is determined by fitting these shapes together.\n*   There's no overlap in the output (shapes are pushed to touch).\n*   I see that the output can be constructed by drawing the shapes (solid) and coloring based on position relative to the special key object.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   I extend my theory to cover the second example.\n*   I test whether this \"quadrant\" hypothesis is still valid.\n*   I re-examine the Key object (in this example, it's not at the top-left).\n*   I confirm the color mapping principle remains the same.\n*   I test that solidified shapes are being transformed.\n*   I notice some shapes are rotated (to better fit).\n*   I test whether shape geometry is preserved.\n\n**Formulating the Rules:**\n\n*   Identify the 4 shapes and extract them.\n*   Apply the key (solidify shapes and recolor according to position).\n*   Arrange the 4 shapes into a solid rectangle (no whitespace).\n\n**New Insights:**\n\n*   The shapes in the output are all rectangular or \"filled-in\" shapes from the input.\n*   There's no blank space in the output.\n*   I need to find a way to place the shapes that maximizes the \"touching\" and fills the whole area.\n*   I am able to deduce that for Ex 1, rotating the TR shape helped the shapes fit.\n\n**Test Input Approach:**\n\n*   I'll identify the four shapes and extract them from the Test Input.\n*   I identify the key colors (3, 6, 4, 8) and assign them to the regions.\n*   I note that the height of each quadrant in the output is probably going to be equal to the corresponding shape (although this has not been consistent).\n*   I'll use the shapes to generate a final output (pushing the shapes into a grid).\n*   I try to create a grid with width 20, but the best approach is to have width equal to the combined width of the solid shape after rotating. This might result in scaling.\n\n**Final Plan and Test:**\n\n*   Generate the final layout.\n*   Apply rotation (or simply placement with color fills if there's sufficient space).\n*   I make a table to generate the 20x20 Output (applying the derived logic).\n*   I check whether BL/BR shapes should be cropped.\n*   I generate the final output and color the grid as 20x20, using the solid shapes.\n\nThe final output is a \n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid into an output grid based on the pattern established in the solved examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid contains four distinct shapes positioned roughly in the four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n2.  **Key Identification:** One of the shapes (the Top-Left one in all examples) contains a 2x2 \"key\" of pixels with different colors. This key acts as a color map for the output.\n    *   The 2x2 key layout `[[TL_color, TR_color], [BL_color, BR_color]]` determines the fill color for the four shapes based on their quadrant.\n    *   Top-Left Shape $\\rightarrow$ becomes `TL_color`.\n    *   Top-Right Shape $\\rightarrow$ becomes `TR_color`.\n    *   Bottom-Left Shape $\\rightarrow$ becomes `BL_color`.\n    *   Bottom-Right Shape $\\rightarrow$ becomes `BR_color`.\n3.  **Geometry and Assembly:**\n    *   The output grid combines these four shapes into a single rectangular (specifically square) block.\n    *   The shapes effectively form a tiling or packing of the output square.\n    *   The dimensions of the output grid seem to be determined by the sum of the widths of the top two shapes (Top-Left + Top-Right) and maintaining a square aspect ratio (or fitting the heights).\n    *   In the test input:\n        *   **Top-Left Object (Source Color 9):** A 10x8 solid block.\n        *   **Top-Right Object (Source Color 5):** A 10x12 solid block.\n        *   **Bottom-Left Object (Source Color 7):** A smaller shape.\n        *   **Bottom-Right Object (Source Color 2):** A smaller shape.\n    *   The Key inside the Top-Left object is:\n        ```\n        3 6\n        4 8\n        ```\n        *   TL Target Color: **3 (Green)**.\n        *   TR Target Color: **6 (Magenta)**.\n        *   BL Target Color: **4 (Yellow)**.\n        *   BR Target Color: **8 (Light Blue)**.\n4.  **Layout Construction:**\n    *   The output width is the sum of the widths of the top two blocks: $10 + 10 = 20$.\n    *   The output height is inferred to be a square matching the width, so $20 \\times 20$.\n    *   **Top-Left (Green):** Occupies the top-left corner. Dimensions 10x8.\n    *   **Top-Right (Magenta):** Occupies the top-right corner. Dimensions 10x12.\n    *   **Bottom-Left (Yellow):** Fills the remaining space below the Top-Left block. Space starts at row 8. Dimensions 10x(20-8) = 10x12.\n    *   **Bottom-Right (Light Blue):** Fills the remaining space below the Top-Right block. Space starts at row 12.

It looks like a pattern recognition problem, so I'm trying to figure out the underlying logic.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Hypotheses:**\n\nMy first thought is, \"Okay, let's break down these examples.\" I start by looking at Example 1. I notice that it's a 20x20 grid with several colored shapes. There's a red \"C\" shape, an orange block, a yellow shape, and a green block. The output is an 8x8 grid. I'm immediately noticing a downscaling operation happening here and the colors are different. I start connecting the dots: \"Input colors are somehow mapped to Output colors. Is there a simple color swap?\" Nope. Instead of focusing on simple transformations, I started to realize there's some kind of structure here.\n\nThe layout of the output gives me a clue: it seems to be quadrants corresponding to the shapes. The Input shapes seem to dictate the colors in output. I'm thinking, \"Is the output a downscaled version with a color mapping?\" No, there seems to be more. I looked closer. It looks like a scaled-up version of something inside the input shapes. I think I see a pattern: the colors inside the red frame are key. So, I realize that the holes inside the red frame are important. Those holes/noise have the values that are used as a mapping key.\n\nFor Example 2, I again analyze the Input and Output grids. This time, the key isn't in the top left, it's somewhere in the center. I see that the mapping is similar. I start noticing the Output colors correspond to colors inside the Key, and their position dictates how shapes are colored.\n\nThe key thing I am realizing is that it's all about **shapes and positions**. I need a way to combine shapes (from all the 4 quadrants) into the output grid.\n\n**Refining the Approach:**\n\nI start thinking \"Ah-ha! Key mapping!\". In both examples, there's a \"Key\" object (a shape with internal values) and other shapes in the different quadrants. I figure that those are the building blocks. I hypothesize, \"The key tells us how to recolor the other shapes!\"\n\nOkay, I need to figure out how the output is arranged. How are these different shapes combined to make the final output grid? I see the shapes are layered.\n\n**Focus on Dimensions & Layout:**\n\nI start to concentrate on grid dimensions. Both inputs are 20x20. But outputs are 8x8 and 10x10. I realized that the Output dimensions are related to the input shape extents. I'm imagining the input as a set of shapes, and the output is a rearrangement of those shapes. \"Do shapes overlap? Are they simply resized? What's the output size?\" I realized that my initial guess about dimensions wasn't correct. I came up with an idea: the \"Key\" object's dimensions dictate the Output. I realized that the Key's frame helps in setting the Output size.\n\n**The Solution Steps (Summarized):**\n\n1.  Identify the 4 main clusters of pixels.\n2.  Find the \"Key\" by identifying unique values inside a 2x2 hole or frame (2x2 of colors). Read those four colors (values).\n3.  Identify the location of the Key, and calculate each object's relationship to the Key's location.\n4.  Each value in the Key tells us which color to replace other clusters' pixels with.\n5.  Output Size depends on Input Extents (Key, and last color object).\n6.  Generate Output Grid.\n7.  Replace all values.\n8.  I will take the shapes from all 4 clusters and, with the key's help, put them together into a final output image.\n\nI'm thinking I've finally got it.  I can solve this! I am ready to move on to the code!\n\n\nTo solve this task, I will apply a transformation based on extracting shapes from the input grid and reassembling them into a new grid according to a specific \"Key\" found in the input.\n\n**Logic:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains four distinct clusters of colored pixels (shapes) against a black (0) background.\n2.  **Locate the Key:** One of these clusters is a \"Key Object\". It is distinguished by being a rectangular frame enclosing a 2x2 area of \"noise\" pixels. These 4 inner pixels are distinct colors and define the color mapping for the output.\n    *   The 2x2 inner region maps the four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) to specific colors:\n        *   `Key[0][0]` (Top-Left value) -> Target Color for the Top-Left Object.\n        *   `Key[0][1]` (Top-Right value) -> Target Color for the Top-Right Object.\n        *   `Key[1][0]` (Bottom-Left value) -> Target Color for the Bottom-Left Object.\n        *   `Key[1][1]` (Bottom-Right value) -> Target Color for the Bottom-Right Object.\n    *   In the Test Input, the Key Object is the Maroon (9) shape in the Top-Left quadrant. Its inner values are:\n        *   Top-Left: 3\n        *   Top-Right: 6\n        *   Bottom-Left: 4\n        *   Bottom-Right: 8\n3.  **Map Objects to Colors:**\n    *   **TL Object** (The Key itself): Maps to Color **3**.\n    *   **TR Object** (Grey 5 shape): Maps to Color **6**.\n    *   **BL Object** (Orange 7 shape): Maps to Color **4**.\n    *   **BR Object** (Red 2 shape): Maps to Color **8**.\n4.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**\n    *   The Output Grid width is the sum of the width of the Key Object's bounding box and the width of the Bottom-Right Object's bounding box.\n        *   Key Width = 10. BR Width = 6. Output Width = 16.\n    *   The Output Grid height is the sum of the height of the Key Object's bounding box and the height of the Bottom-Right Object's bounding box.\n        *   Key Height = 8. BR Height = 4. Output Height = 12.\n    *   Output Size: **16x12**.\n5.  **Construct the Output:**\n    *   **Background:** Fill the entire output grid with the color mapped to the Bottom-Right Object (Color **8**).\n    *   **Draw Bottom-Left Object:** Place the shape of the BL object (recolored to **4**) at the bottom-left of the layout structure, which corresponds to coordinates `(0, Key_Height)`. Crop any parts that fall outside the grid.\n    *   **Draw Top-Right Object:** Place the shape of the TR object (recolored to **6**) at the top-right of the layout structure, which corresponds to coordinates `(Key_Width, 0)`. Crop any parts that fall outside the grid.\n    *   **Draw Top-Left Object:** Place the shape of the TL object (recolored to **3**) at `(0, 0)`. The Key object is treated as a shape where non-zero pixels (frame + inner noise) are solid, and 0s are transparent (revealing the background).\n\n**Test Input Application:**\n\n*   **Output Size:** 16x12.\n*   **Fill:** Color 8.\n*   **Layer 1 (BL Object -> 4):** The Orange shape is placed at `(0, 8)`.\n    *   Row 0 maps to Output Row 8: `4,4,4`.\n    *   Row 1 maps to Output Row 9: `4,4,4`.\n    *   Row 2 maps to Output Row 10: `4,4,4`.\n    *   Row 3 maps to Output Row 11: `4`.\n*   **Layer 2 (TR Object -> 6):** The Grey shape is placed at `(10, 0)`.\n    *   Based on the shape analysis, it draws patterns of 6s on the right side (cols 10-15).\n*   **Layer 3 (TL Object -> 3):** The Maroon Key shape is placed at `(0, 0)`.\n    *   It draws the frame and inner pixels as 3s.

I'm presented with an ARC task. I need to figure out a pattern based on examples and apply it.  Let's break down the first example.  It's a grid with a bunch of shapes of different colors. The output is smaller, and it looks like a section of the input.  I'm noticing that the colors in the output don't seem to directly correspond to the colors of the main shapes in the input.  Hmm, this is interesting.\n\n**Uncovering the Core Pattern**\n\nI'm drawn to a \"red\" container-like shape in the input, and inside it are smaller colors. Bingo! These smaller, contained colors in the input, specifically their colors, seem to align with the output colors. This suggests the output is generated by focusing on the content *inside* certain input shapes.  The TL shape contains seeds. These seeds get mapped to the 4 quadrants of the output. I also realized that the other regions were not just placed as templates of the colors. \n\n**Mapping the Shapes**\n\nSo, the seed's position determines the destination output region. The shape's color inside that region must be used. Let's start thinking about what is causing each region's shape.  Analyzing the input grid's shapes themselves is key here. The output is also constructed to form some shape! They seem to be combined in a way that relates to the structure of the input, the shape and size.  I notice this might involve a clever rotation to fit within the 8x8 square.\n\n**Refining the Theory and Rotations**\n\nThe \"cycle\" mapping!  Not just which quadrant, but also *rotation*. Examining the Ex 2 case: it seems there's a specific order and some rotation going on.  The order is based on the input TL. What about Ex 2? The Ex 1 is a special case that doesn't follow a pattern, it seems. And Test Inputs will not be the same. The seed of the TL region and its arrangement drives where each element goes, and possibly by what angle or orientation the regions are placed.\n\n**Applying the Theory: Test Input**\n\nI need to apply this to the new test. I am thinking about how to visualize the shapes so they fit together.  Let's start by trying to place the largest shapes first. I'm focusing on the input arrangement to create the correct sized grid. I should check again the input sizes and then think about what the combined grids might look like. I should think about how to map them to an output and their shape.\n\n**Final Grid**\n\nThe logic appears to be to form a grid with parts of the original puzzle fitting. The frame appears to be the most important. The other elements are used to fill out the remaining parts. I have to make a best guess.\n\n\nThe ARC task presents a puzzle where the goal is to transform an input grid into an output grid based on a set of rules inferred from examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Input Segmentation**: The input grid contains four distinct colored clusters (shapes) located roughly in the four quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n    *   In the test input:\n        *   TL Cluster: Maroon (9)\n        *   TR Cluster: Grey (5)\n        *   BL Cluster: Orange (7)\n        *   BR Cluster: Red (2)\n\n2.  **Mapping Logic (Seed)**: Inside the Top-Left cluster (Maroon 9), there is a 2x2 block of \"intruder\" pixels that acts as a key for the output colors.\n    *   Test Input Seed (inside the 9s):\n        ```\n        3 6\n        4 8\n        ```\n    *   This 2x2 seed maps directly to the four quadrants of the output grid:\n        *   Output TL: Green (3)\n        *   Output TR: Magenta (6)\n        *   Output BL: Yellow (4)\n        *   Output BR: Light Blue (8)\n\n3.  **Shape Transformation & Assembly**: The output grid is formed by taking the shapes of the four input clusters and arranging them into a single rectangular block (puzzle fit). The shapes are transformed (moved and potentially rotated) to fit together.\n    *   **TL Input (9) $\\rightarrow$ Output TL (3)**: The TL shape is the \"anchor\" and is not rotated. It forms the left frame. Its shape (widths per row) is `9, 9, 4, 4, 2, 2, 7, 7`.\n    *   **Input BR (2) $\\rightarrow$ Output TR (6)**: Following the cycle pattern from Example 2 (BR $\\rightarrow$ TR), the BR shape (widths `3, 4, 5, 6`) is moved to the Top-Right. It fills the \"gap\" in the TL frame.\n        *   TL Gap at rows 2-5: Widths available are `5, 5, 7, 7`.\n        *   BR Shape `3, 4, 5, 6` fits perfectly into this gap.\n    *   **Input BL (7) $\\rightarrow$ Output BR (8)**: Following the pattern (BL $\\rightarrow$ BR), the BL shape (widths `3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1`) is moved to the Bottom-Right.\n        *   TL Gap at rows 6-7: Widths available are `2, 2`.\n        *   Wait, the TL shape at rows 6-7 has width 7, leaving a gap of 2 (assuming total width 9). The BL shape widths are `3,3...`. This doesn't fit directly.\n        *   However, looking at the assembled shapes in previous examples, the shapes are simply packed. The BL shape corresponds to the seed color 8 (BR position).\n    *   **Input TR (5) $\\rightarrow$ Output BL (4)**: The large shape corresponds to the remaining quadrant.\n\n    **Refined Assembly for Test Input**:\n    The output grid is constructed by taking the Anchor (TL shape, color 3) and filling its negative space with the other shapes.\n    *   **Frame (3)**:\n        Rows 0-1: Full width (9).\n        Rows 2-3: Width 4.\n        Rows 4-5: Width 2.\n        Rows 6-7: Width 7.\n    *   **Gap Filling**:\n        Rows 2-5 (Right side): The BR shape (converted to color 6) fits here.\n        Rows 6-7 (Right side): The remaining gap is small. The BL shape (converted to color 8) is placed here.\n        The layout of the output 8s and 4s is determined by the remaining fit. Given the seed `4 8` at the bottom, and the shapes available, the grid is constructed as a 9x8 block.\n\n**Output Grid Construction**:\n*   **Color 3 (Green)**: Follows the TL input mask.\n*   **Color 6 (Magenta)**: Fills the upper indentation (from Input BR).\n*   **Color 8 (Light Blue)**: Fills the lower indentation (from Input BL).\n*   **Color 4 (Yellow)**: Corresponds to the large input shape, but in the puzzle logic, it fills any remaining large background or is mapped to the specific corner indicated by the seed. In this specific compact puzzle assembly, the primary components are 3, 6, and 8 filling the 9x8 bounds.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,4,4\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4\n3,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,4\n3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,3,3,6,6,6,4,4\n      3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4\n      3,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,4\n      3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,4\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"2\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_4_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**The Enigmatic ARC Task**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to solve an ARC task, and I'm looking at two example solutions to figure out the underlying logic. It seems we have two inputs, a 20x20 grid, and we need to output an 8x8 grid. The output is a smaller subset of the input data but still relies on it.\n\nLooking at Example 1, there are 4 distinct shapes, each in a different color.  One is especially interesting, it's this weird 'C' shaped thing with other colors inside, it's in the top left. The other three shapes are just blocks.  The output has colors and is a smaller grid. I need to figure out the connection.  It's the interior colors of that top-left shape: 1, 5, 8, 9, arranged as seeds that dictate the arrangement of the output.  The other shapes act as \"masks\" that dictate how the output is formed. They define the shape of regions, kind of.\n\nThe output looks like regions, partitioned using the colors from the red shape.\n\nLet's look closer, I see a pattern: the colors in the output grid are those that were found INSIDE the red shape.\n\nSo here's what I think: The key shape defines the colors and their relative arrangement. The other shapes define some geometry or \"mask\" the background color.\n\nThe output looks like a collision of regions. It seems like the output shapes have some relationship with the mask shapes.\n\nAfter looking at the first example, I'm thinking the colors are determined by the inner colors, but somehow the mask shapes are influencing the output shapes. I need to determine the influence.\n\nExample 2 reinforces the \"Legend\" and \"Mask\" concept. There's a legend shape again, this time magenta, and shapes of gray, maroon, and blue.\n\nThe goal seems to be to figure out the relationship between the colors in the legend, and the positions of the colors in the masks.\n\nNow I'm hypothesizing:  The output is essentially a scaled-up version of the legend's inner pixels, where the positions are influenced by the other shapes (like a Voronoi diagram but with more complex boundaries). The masks appear to influence the geometry of the final output. The boundaries between the output regions seem to be the intersections.\n\nMaybe it's about shape transformations.\n\nThe output size seems related to the bounding boxes of the shapes, it\u2019s all connected.\n\nI'm starting to think about this in terms of applying transformations to the shapes, where the Legend is used to map colors to their positions in the output. The input shapes are transformed and then superimposed to form the output grid.\n\nLet's test by confirming the first example. The Red Shape and its inner colors are acting as a map, telling me where to place things and what colors to use. I take the mask shapes, rotate them, and place them according to the legend's colors.  I think the rotations are the key to unlocking this puzzle.\n\nBased on the shape transformations, it seems that there are 4 main rules. They all relate to geometric transformations.\n\nI think I've cracked it.  It's about placing those shapes in a square grid and letting them collide. But what\u2019s that gap in the grid?  That must be determined by the shape. And if there is any unfilled area, it needs to be filled with something.\nI have a solid understanding of how it all works.\n\nThe solution involves identifying four distinct shapes in the input grid, determining a color mapping from a \"legend,\" transforming the shapes (rotation), and assembling them into a new, smaller grid.\n\n**1. Identify Shapes and Roles**\nThere are four quadrants of shapes in the input grid.\n*   **Top-Left (TL):** A \"Legend\" shape containing distinct inner colors. In the test input, this is the Maroon (9) shape. Inside it are pixels of colors 3, 6, 4, and 8.\n*   **Top-Right (TR):** A shape of a single color. In the test input, this is Cyan (5).\n*   **Bottom-Left (BL):** A shape of a single color. In the test input, this is Orange (7).\n*   **Bottom-Right (BR):** A shape of a single color. In the test input, this is Red (2).\n\n**2. Decode the Legend**\nThe Legend shape (Maroon 9) contains a 2x2 key of inner pixels:\n```\n3 6\n4 8\n```\nThis key maps the position of the input shapes to the colors they will become in the output:\n*   **TL Position** maps to **Color 3**.\n*   **TR Position** maps to **Color 6**.\n*   **BL Position** maps to **Color 4**.\n*   **BR Position** maps to **Color 8**.\n\nAdditionally, the color corresponding to the Bottom-Right shape (Color 8) serves as the **background color** for the output grid, filling any gaps.\n\n**3. Extract and Transform Shapes**\nWe extract the binary mask of each shape (bounding box) and apply specific geometric transformations:\n*   **TL Shape (Source 9 -> Target 3):** No rotation (Identity).\n    *   Input Bounding Box: 10 wide x 8 high.\n*   **TR Shape (Source 5 -> Target 6):** Rotate 90\u00b0 Clockwise.\n    *   Input Bounding Box: 10 wide x 12 high.\n    *   Rotated Size: 12 wide x 10 high.\n*   **BL Shape (Source 7 -> Target 4):** Rotate 90\u00b0 Counter-Clockwise.\n    *   Input Bounding Box: 3 wide x 6 high.\n    *   Rotated Size: 6 wide x 3 high.\n*   **BR Shape (Source 2 -> Target 8):** Rotate 180\u00b0. (This shape is the background color, so it merges with the fill).\n\n**4. Determine Output Grid Dimensions**\nThe output grid is a square. Its width is the sum of the widths of the top-row shapes:\n*   Width = Width(TL) + Width(Rotated TR) = 10 + 12 = **22**.\n*   Height = **22**.\n\n**5.

It looks like it's a grid puzzle where the input gets transformed into a smaller output. I see shapes and colors involved.\n\nMy thought process is starting with breaking down the shapes from the input grid. I see colorful regions and \"intruder\" pixels within some of them. In the first example, I see a red shape with other colors inside, and then this same arrangement is represented in the output in a smaller way. The intruders are the key. It looks like a mapping is happening. The sizes of the output seems related to the size of the shapes in the input.\n\nIt seems like there's a specific pattern with these \"intruders,\" their positions inside a primary shape (like the red shape in example 1), and their relation to the overall grid and output size. I start thinking this is an arrangement of the shapes. I realize there are shapes that represent the 4 quadrants of the output. The shape dictates the tile of the color in the output. The shapes are rotated, or resized to fit.\n\nAfter analyzing the examples, I can derive a hypothesis: I need to identify a \"Map\" (the shape containing the intruders). Then I check the layout of the other shapes in the input grid.  I need to figure out which position of these objects match the relative location of the intruder. The location of the object defines which color (aka intruder color) will go there.  The shapes are rotated by a certain degree.\n\nI am suspecting the grid is build with 4 shapes that are colored in according to the target colors, or intruder colors.\n\nI figured out a few things. Here's a summary of my transformation:\n\n1.  Find the \"Key Map\" (shape with intruder).\n2.  Find the object shapes that are used in the quadrant of the grid.  A color in the location matches the intruder locations.\n3.  Based on the mapping, I am looking for the tile that will be formed\n4.  Apply rotation (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees)\n5.  Tile the shapes.\n\nWith this knowledge, I can start applying this logic to the test case and build the required output, let's see how it goes.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects and Roles:**\n    *   The input grid contains four main distinct colored objects.\n    *   One of these objects (the **Map Object**) contains \"intruder\" pixels\u2014single pixels of colors different from the object itself.\n    *   The other three objects are solid shapes (or shapes with holes, but no intruders).\n\n2.  **Determine Mappings:**\n    *   The **Map Object** defines the target layout. The positions of the intruder pixels inside the Map Object correspond to the four quadrants of the output grid (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n    *   The **Intruder Colors** determine the color of the region in that quadrant of the output grid.\n    *   The **Source Shapes** for these output regions are the four objects in the input grid. The mapping from Input Object to Output Region is determined by their relative positions (Quadrants) in the input grid.\n    *   Analyzing Example 2 (which shares the mapping logic with the Test Input due to the swap pattern):\n        *   **TL Input Object** $\\rightarrow$ **TL Output Region** (Color defined by TL Intruder).\n        *   **BL Input Object** $\\rightarrow$ **TR Output Region** (Color defined by TR Intruder).\n        *   **TR Input Object** $\\rightarrow$ **BL Output Region** (Color defined by BL Intruder).\n        *   **BR Input Object** $\\rightarrow$ **BR Output Region** (Color defined by BR Intruder).\n\n3.  **Apply Transformations (Rotation and Tiling):**\n    *   The shapes are extracted, solidified (intruders/internal holes filled), and rotated to tile together into a square output grid.\n    *   **TL Source (Maroon)** $\\rightarrow$ **TL Target (Color 3)**: No rotation.\n    *   **BL Source (Orange)** $\\rightarrow$ **TR Target (Color 6)**: Rotated 90\u00b0 Clockwise.\n    *   **TR Source (Gray)** $\\rightarrow$ **BL Target (Color 4)**: Rotated to fit (likely 180\u00b0 or tailored to fill the gap).\n    *   **BR Source (Red)** $\\rightarrow$ **BR Target (Color 8)**: No rotation (or fits the remaining BR corner).\n    *   The dimensions of the output grid are the sum of the widths of the top-row shapes (TL width + TR width).\n        *   TL (Maroon) Width: 9.\n        *   TR (Orange, rotated) Width: 6.\n        *   Output Grid Size: 15x15.\n\n4.  **Construct the Output Grid:**\n    *   **Region 3 (Maroon Shape):** Placed at (0,0).\n        *   Rows 0-3: Width 9.\n        *   Rows 4-5: Width 2.\n        *   Rows 6-7: Width 7.\n    *   **Region 6 (Orange Shape):** Placed at Top-Right.\n        *   Rotated 90\u00b0 CW. Input was L-shape (3 wide, 6 high). Rotated is 6 wide, 3 high.\n        *   Fills the top-right corner gap. Row 0 matches full width (9+6=15).

The goal is to generate a smaller output grid from a larger input grid containing colored regions. The process looks like a partitioning of the input into regions based on the Manhattan distance from key \"seed\" points.\n\nFirst, I identified key patterns: distinct, colored clusters within the input grid, and a consistent output grid filled with a smaller set of colors (no 0s). The hint of four disconnected clusters (seeds) with embedded colors are very important. The output grid size relates to the input, but not always through simple scaling.\n\nI delved into the hints, noting the \"staircase-like\" boundaries, which suggests Manhattan distance (Voronoi) propagation from the \"seed\" clusters to determine each output region. The problem boils down to correctly identifying the seeds and determining the correct size of the output grid.\n\nI recognized the four clusters as the starting points. I saw they had a palette of interior colors. For Example 1, I noted the TL cluster has the \"palette\". In Example 2, the TL cluster has the interior palette. From the palette colors, the quadrant in the Output is color-coded.\n\nThis led me to hypothesize the key to the task: The key is to identify the \"palette\" cluster and then map the quadrent seed cluster. Example 1 showed the output was colored with the interior 2x2.\n\nI need the dimensions of the output grid. In this, I observed the output region colors don't match input colors, which is logical. Using two example output grids, I tried several options for generating the output dimensions, focusing on counts, bounding boxes of colored cells in input, and the gaps between clusters. However, no clear relationship emerged. I made the following hypothesis about how the Output is generated: The input can be \"scaled down\" by a factor of 2. I need to test for the final solution, but for the Test input, the number of columns and rows could be different. I could take a scale of `(W-padding)/2` for width and `(H-padding)/2` for height.\n\nI need to confirm the algorithm. With Test Input, I'll take a BBox size of `22, 21`. I should try a scaled grid of `11x11`.\n\nI must define where these \"seed\" locations should be, on the smaller output grid. My guess is that the centroid scaled down, is the starting point on the scaled grid for each cluster.\n\nThe plan now is:\n1.  **Extract the Palette.** Identify the four color cluster with an embedded palette. Map the palette colors to output regions in a TL-TR-BL-BR fashion.\n2.  **Define Output Grid Size.** Divide the Input Bounding Box by a scale of 2. Use this, combined with padding where necessary.\n3.  **Find Seed Locations.** Based on BBox centroids, scale the coordinates of the cluster centroids relative to the new Output Grid.\n4.  **Perform Voronoi/Growth Simulation**. On the scaled grid, perform Manhattan Distance from these seeds. Generate the output based on this.\n\nI'm ready to begin the test with this plan.\n\nTo solve the test input, for the final output grid, I will generate the Voronoi regions with 11x11, the dimensions. The TL will be green, the TR will be Magenta, the BL will be Yellow, the BR will be Teal. The code will be ready.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a large grid containing four colored clusters into a smaller, fully filled grid partitioned into four regions. The solution involves identifying the \"seeds\", extracting the color palette, determining the output grid dimensions, and generating the partition based on Manhattan distance (growth).\n\n### 1. Identifying Seeds and Palette\nThere are four distinct clusters in the input grid.\n- **Top-Left (TL):** Maroon (9) cluster.\n- **Top-Right (TR):** Grey (5) cluster.\n- **Bottom-Left (BL):** Orange (7) cluster.\n- **Bottom-Right (BR):** Red (2) cluster.\n\nOne of these clusters acts as the \"Palette Cluster\". In the solved examples, this is the cluster containing a 2x2 multicolor pattern embedded within it.\nLooking at the Test Input, the Maroon (9) cluster (TL) contains:\n- Row 5: `... 9, 3, 6, 9 ...`\n- Row 6: `... 9, 4, 8, 9 ...`\nThe embedded palette is:\n```\n3 6\n4 8\n```\nThese colors correspond to the four quadrants of the output relative to the seed positions:\n- **TL Color:** 3 (Green)\n- **TR Color:** 6 (Magenta)\n- **BL Color:** 4 (Yellow)\n- **BR Color:** 8 (Teal)\n\n### 2. Determining Output Dimensions\nIn the examples, the output grid size is approximately half the dimensions of the bounding box of the active input area.\n- **Example 1:** Input BBox ~16x17. Output 8x8. (Scaling factor ~0.5).\n- **Example 2:** Input BBox ~18x18. Output 10x10. (Scaling factor ~0.55).\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- The active clusters span from Column 3 to 24 (Width = 22).\n- They span from Row 4 to 24 (Height = 21).\n- Applying the scaling logic (roughly half):\n  - Width: 22 / 2 = 11.\n  - Height: 21 / 2 = 10.5 -> We will use 11 for a square-ish result, matching the aspect ratio closely. Let's select **11x11** as the output grid size.\n\n### 3. Determining Seed Locations\nWe map the centroids of the input clusters to the new 11x11 grid coordinate system.\n- **TL Cluster:** Centered approx at (7, 7) in input. Relative to BBox origin (3,4): (4, 3). Scaled by 0.5: **(2, 2)**.\n- **TR Cluster:** Centered approx at (21, 11). Relative: (18, 7). Scaled: **(9, 3)**.\n- **BL Cluster:** Centered approx at (4, 21). Relative: (1, 17). Scaled: **(1, 9)**.\n- **BR Cluster:** Centered approx at (19, 21). Relative: (16, 17). Scaled: **(8, 9)**.\n\n### 4. Generating the Partition (Voronoi)\nWe assign each cell in the 11x11 grid the color of the closest seed using Manhattan distance ($|x_1-x_2| + |y_1-y_2|$).\n\n**Seeds:**\n- **3 (Green):** (2, 2)\n- **6 (Magenta):** (9, 3)\n- **4 (Yellow):** (1, 9)\n- **8 (Teal):** (8, 9)\n\n**Boundaries:**\n- **Left vs Right (3 vs 6):** Midpoint $x \\approx 5.5$. Split at index 5/6.\n- **Left vs Right (4 vs 8):** Midpoint $x \\approx 4.5$. Split at index 4/5.\n- **Top vs Bottom (3 vs 4):** Midpoint $y \\approx 5.5$. Split at index 5/6.\n- **Top vs Bottom (6 vs 8):** Midpoint $y \\approx 6.0$. Split at index 6.\n\nThis creates a partition where:\n- **Top-Left** is Green (3).\n- **Top-Right** is Magenta (6).\n- **Bottom-Left** is Yellow (4).\n- **Bottom-Right** is Teal (8).\n\nThe boundaries will be staircase-like due to the discrete Manhattan distance calculations.\n\noutput:\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"13\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Comprehensive Task Analysis and Solution Strategy**\n\nMy primary objective is to solve an ARC task that presents a series of inputs and corresponding outputs, with the goal of generalizing the underlying pattern to a novel input. I've broken this down into several key steps and observations:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Input/Output Relationship:** I start by carefully comparing the dimensions of the input and output grids (e.g., 20x20 input maps to 8x8 or 10x10 outputs). I note that the output size is smaller, suggesting a form of downsampling or a focus on a core region of the input. I also observe the recurring presence of 4 distinct clusters of non-zero pixels within each input.\n2.  **Cluster Identification and Characterization:** The inputs consistently contain 4 clusters. One of these is a \"special\" cluster because it contains pixels of multiple colors. The other 3 are usually uniform in color and form blocks.\n3.  **Special Cluster as the Key:** The most crucial element appears to be the \"special\" cluster. It contains a \"palette\" of colors (e.g., 1, 5, 8, 9). I've noted that the output grid contains pixels from the colors inside the special cluster.\n4.  **Spatial Mapping:** The output regions get assigned colors. The output region colors seem to depend on: the colors found inside the special cluster and which cluster they are found in (TL, TR, BL, BR). This suggests a mapping between the quadrants of the input and the palette color. The output grid shows \"staircase-like\" borders suggesting Manhattan distance or Voronoi diagram.\n5.  **Output Grid Generation:** The critical puzzle lies in how to determine the correct size of the output grid.\n    *   **Area Preservation Hypothesis:** The total number of pixels in the output grid might be equal to the total number of non-zero pixels in the input (Ex: 64 total pixels in Ex 1, which has 64 pixels).\n    *   **The Size Relation:** The relationship between input and output sizes is not linear and cannot be explained by simple ratios. However, some connections can be seen. For example, if you remove rows and cols, Ex 1 Input size 20x20 = output 8x8; Ex 2 input 20x20 = output 10x10. The test input is 26x26. Given the full grid \"constraint\", and pixel preservation, I will need to predict the size.\n6.  **Proposed Algorithm**:\n\n    *   **Cluster Pixel Count:** Compute the pixel count for each input cluster: top left (C1), top right (C2), bottom left (C3), and bottom right (C4).\n    *   **Find Area:** Calculate the sum of the total pixels $A = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4$\n    *   **Dimension Determination**: The total output grid dimensions (W x H) is equal to A.\n    *   **Seed Placement:** The seed locations determine region growth\n    *   **Voronoi Construction:** The main task is constructing a Manhattan distance Voronoi diagram (staircase-like borders).\n    *   **Palette assignment:** Identify the special (multi-colored) cluster and extract the four palette colors (P1, P2, P3, P4). Based on the 4 regions, assign the palette to that region.\n    *   **Final Output:** Produce the output grid using the assigned regions, ensuring that the number of pixels matches the expected pixel count for each color\n\n\nThe solution involves three main steps: identifying the output grid dimensions, determining the mapping from input clusters to output regions, and constructing the final grid based on pixel counts.\n\n**1. Determine Output Grid Dimensions**\nBy analyzing the examples, we find that the total number of non-zero pixels in the input grid equals the total area (number of cells) of the output grid.\n*   **Example 1:** Input pixel count is exactly 64. Output is 8x8 ($8 \\times 8 = 64$).\n*   **Example 2:** Input pixel count is exactly 100. Output is 10x10 ($10 \\times 10 = 100$).\n*   **Test Input:** Counting the pixels in the four clusters:\n    *   Top-Left (9s with inner detail): 52 pixels.\n    *   Top-Right (5s): 62 pixels.\n    *   Bottom-Left (7s): 12 pixels.\n    *   Bottom-Right (2s): 18 pixels.\n    *   **Total:** $52 + 62 + 12 + 18 = 144$.\n    *   Square root of 144 is 12.\n    *   **Output Grid Size:** 12x12.\n\n**2. Determine Color Mapping**\nThe \"special\" cluster (the one containing a multicolored palette) dictates the colors. The mapping rule observed in Example 1 is:\n*   TL Cluster $\\rightarrow$ TL Palette Color\n*   TR Cluster $\\rightarrow$ TR Palette Color\n*   BL Cluster $\\rightarrow$ BR Palette Color (Note the swap)\n*   BR Cluster $\\rightarrow$ BL Palette Color (Note the swap)\n\nFor the Test Input:\n*   **Special Cluster** is the Top-Left one (9s).\n*   **Palette:**\n    *   Row 5: `...9,3,6,9...` $\\rightarrow$ TL=3, TR=6.\n    *   Row 6: `...9,4,8,9...` $\\rightarrow$ BL=4, BR=8.\n*   **Mapping:**\n    *   **TL Cluster** (size 52) $\\rightarrow$ TL Color **3**.\n    *   **TR Cluster** (size 62) $\\rightarrow$ TR Color **6**.\n    *   **BL Cluster** (size 12) $\\rightarrow$ BR Color **8**.\n    *   **BR Cluster** (size 18) $\\rightarrow$ BL Color **4**.\n\n**3. Construct the Grid**\nWe partition the 12x12 grid into 4 regions with sizes matching the cluster pixel counts: Region 3 (52 px), Region 6 (62 px), Region 8 (12 px), Region 4 (18 px).\nThe regions grow from their respective corners (TL, TR, BL, BR) using Manhattan distance logic to form staircase boundaries.\n\n*   **Region 8 (BL, 12 px):** Occupies the bottom-left. A 12-pixel staircase corresponds to the bottom 3 rows of the first 2 columns and bottom 2 rows of the next 3 columns.\n    *   Rows 9-11 in Cols 0-1.\n    *   Rows 10-11 in Cols 2-4.\n*   **Region 4 (BR, 18 px):** Occupies the bottom-right. An 18-pixel staircase corresponds to the bottom 3 rows of the last 4 columns and bottom 2 rows of the preceding 3 columns.\n    *   Rows 9-11 in Cols 8-11.\n    *   Rows 10-11 in Cols 5-7.\n*   **Region 3 (TL, 52 px):** Fills the remaining Top-Left area.\n    *   Fills Cols 0-4 above Region 8.\n    *   Spills into Col 5 (top 4 rows) to reach the count of 52.\n*   **Region 6 (TR, 62 px):** Fills the remaining Top-Right area.\n    *   Fills Cols 6-11 above Region 4.\n    *   Fills Col 5 (middle rows) to reach the count of 62.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,4,4\n8,8,3,3,3,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,4,4\n      8,8,3,3,3,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"14\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_5_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this ARC task, I need to understand the transformation from the examples:\n\n## Analysis\n\n**Key observations:**\n1.

After reviewing example 1 and the test input, I've figured out the core principle: we're dealing with a \"collage\" or \"layering\" of image objects within a grid, but not in a simple way. The input objects are assigned to quadrants, and their colors are defined by a container object in the input grid. I will need to predict the output image.\n\n**Key Observations and Rules:**\n\n1.  **Object Roles:** The input objects function as image \"paint buckets\". In the ARC task, we divide the output into quadrants. The container's internal structure and seeds determine the layout and color.\n\n2.  **Output Size:** The output size isn't directly related to container size. The output width is equal to the bounding boxes of the objects on the top row; the output height is the sum of the bounding box of the top object and bottom objects. In some cases, the height may be truncated.\n\n3.  **Color Determination:** The output regions are filled by colors from internal elements of the container. Inside the Container object are 2x2 or 4 Seed pixels representing colors. A seed color is assigned to each quadrant.\n\n4.  **Layout:** The Input grid will be divided into 4 quadrants. Each output grid Quadrant will be assigned to colors by its seeds. The size of the objects in the other quadrants will be assigned to determine the output grid, the grid may be clipped/reduced.\n\n    *   **TL** (Top-Left): Shape determined by the Container Mask. Color from the TL seed in the container.  It also fills the empty space in the TL quadrant.\n    *   **TR** (Top-Right): Shape of Object, Color from TR seed in container. Placed adjacent to TL, right-aligned to the container.\n    *   **BL** (Bottom-Left): Shape of object, Color from BL Seed from Container. Placed below TL, Left aligned.\n    *   **BR** (Bottom-Right): Shape of object, Color from BR Seed from Container. Aligned to the BL object, the bottom right-aligned to BL and the right edge of TR.\n\n5.  **Overlay:** The TL shape is usually on top. The background is the BR object, which is \"invisible\" to the eye.\n\n**How to solve a new task:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the container object and the other 3 objects. Check the container for the colors. Identify the seed color for each quadrant.\n\n2.  **Determine Output Size:**  Calculate width. The Grid Width=TL.W + TR.W\n    Calculate height: H=TL.H + BL.H.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Place the background object at 0 in the TL region.\n    *   Draw the TL object in the TL region.\n    *   Draw the TR object by positioning it adjacent to the TL object on the right side.\n    *   Draw the BL object below and aligned to TL, and use any space below TL to draw the shape.\n    *   Draw the BR object below and right of BL.\n\nNow, let's start coding this up.\n\n\nTo solve the ARC task, I have analyzed the solved examples and the test input to deduce the underlying transformation rule.\n\n**Reasoning Summary:**\n1.  **Input Decomposition:** The input grids contain a \"Container\" object (identified by having specific \"noise\" pixels inside it) and three other distinct colored objects. The spatial arrangement of these four objects corresponds to four quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n2.  **Seed Mapping:** The \"noise\" pixels inside the Container form a 2x2 pattern of \"Seeds\". These seeds define the **Color** to be used for the corresponding quadrant in the output grid.\n    *   TL Seed -> Color for TL Region.\n    *   TR Seed -> Color for TR Region.\n    *   BL Seed -> Color for BL Region.\n    *   BR Seed -> Color for BR Region.\n3.  **Geometry and Layout:** The Output Grid is a composition of the shapes (masks) of the four input objects.\n    *   The grid is divided into four regions. The dimensions of the regions are determined by the bounding boxes of the input objects.\n    *   Specifically, the **TL Object** (which is also the Container) sets the width of the left column (`W_left`) and the height of the top row (`H_top`).\n    *   The **TR Object** sets the width of the right column (`W_right`).\n    *   The **BL Object** sets the height of the bottom row (`H_bottom`).\n    *   **Output Grid Size:** Width = `W_left` + `W_right`. Height = `H_top` + `H_bottom`.\n4.  **Drawing Rule:** For each quadrant, the mask of the corresponding source object (its non-zero pixels within its bounding box) is drawn in the corresponding region's specific color.\n    *   **Background:** The background of the output grid is filled with the color of the **BR Seed**. Any \"empty\" space in the object masks (pixels that were 0 in the input bounding box) takes this background color.\n    *   **Mask Application:**\n        *   TL Region (at `0,0`): Draws TL Object Mask in TL Seed Color.\n        *   TR Region (at `W_left, 0`): Draws TR Object Mask in TR Seed Color.\n        *   BL Region (at `0, H_top`): Draws BL Object Mask in BL Seed Color.\n        *   BR Region (at `W_left, H_top`): Draws BR Object Mask in BR Seed Color.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Objects & Seeds:**\n    *   **Container (TL Object):** Maroon shape. Bounding Box: 10x8 (Width 10, Height 8).\n        *   Inside Seeds: Green (3), Magenta (6), Yellow (4), Teal (8).\n        *   **TL Seed:** Green (3).\n        *   **TR Seed:** Magenta (6).\n        *   **BL Seed:** Yellow (4).\n        *   **BR Seed:** Teal (8).\n    *   **TR Object:** Gray shape. Bounding Box: 10x12 (Width 10). (Cropped to fit canvas or canvas expands? Based on Ex 1, top row height is fixed by TL Object height. We use `H_top = 8`). Mask is taken from the first 8 rows of the Gray object.\n    *   **BL Object:** Orange shape. Bounding Box: 3x6 (Width 3, Height 6).\n    *   **BR Object:** Red shape. Bounding Box: 6x4 (Width 6, Height 4).\n*   **Dimensions:**\n    *   `W_left` = 10 (from TL).\n    *   `W_right` = 10 (from TR). Total Width = 20.\n    *   `H_top` = 8 (from TL).\n    *   `H_bottom` = 6 (from BL). Total Height = 14.\n    *   Grid Size: 20x14.\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   TL: Green (3).\n    *   TR: Magenta (6).\n    *   BL: Yellow (4).\n    *   BR: Teal (8) (Same as Background).\n*   **Construction:**\n    *   **Background:** Fill 20x14 with Teal (8).\n    *   **TL Region (0,0):** Draw Maroon Container mask in Green (3).\n    *   **TR Region (10,0):** Draw Gray Object mask (top 8 rows) in Magenta (6).\n    *   **BL Region (0,8):** Draw Orange Object mask in Yellow (4).\n    *   **BR Region (10,8):** Draw Red Object mask in Teal (8). (Since color is Teal and background is Teal, this shape is effectively invisible/merged).\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8\n      3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"19\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Analysis of a Complex ARC Task and Construction of a Solution**\n\nI'm tasked with solving an ARC puzzle based on example inputs and applying the logic to a new test case. The instructions are initially confusing, with contradictions about whether to provide an explanation or just the final grid. However, after careful consideration of the system and user prompts, I've determined that providing both a detailed explanation and the output grid is the intended behavior. The key is to analyze the relationship between input shapes, their positions, and the resulting output grid.\n\nI start by meticulously examining the provided examples. The puzzle seems to involve extracting and transforming shapes from the input grid and arranging them in a predictable manner on the output canvas. I identify the \u201cKey\u201d shape (often containing a unique arrangement of colors) as a central element. This key, typically in the top-left quadrant, dictates the mapping of shapes to colors, effectively linking the quadrants to the output grid's arrangement. The output\u2019s dimensions are calculated from the combined size and transformation of these component shapes.\n\nEach shape in the original grid is extracted and its spatial transformation is assessed. These shapes are then placed onto the final canvas, which has a size that\u2019s a combination of these transformations. For example, if the top-right needs to be rotated 90 degrees, its original height, after the rotation, becomes the width that\u2019s added to calculate the total output width. The overlapping colors determine which colour shows in the output grid.\n\nThe goal is to generate an output grid and to reconstruct the solution logic. In the test input, I break down the task into smaller steps:\n\n1.  **Identify quadrants:** divide the input grid into four quadrants, each containing a main object.\n2.  **Locate the Key:** Find the shape that includes a set of distinctive colours (3, 6, 4 and 8 in the test input). The values within it map to corresponding quadrants.\n3.  **Establish Transformation Logic:** Determine the specific spatial rotation (often 90 degrees) for each shape.\n4.  **Calculate the Canvas Size:**  I calculate the output width by adding width of the top-left shape with height of the top-right shape, and the height with adding the height of the top-left with height of the bottom-left.\n5.  **Translate Shapes to Colors:** Use the colour key (quadrants mapped to shapes) to find the correct colors.\n6.  **Recreate the Output Grid:** Create the final output grid, placing the shapes on the defined grid.\n\nApplying this logic to the test input, I generate the output grid by correctly placing each transformed input shape and assign the correct colour to it. I carefully assess the rotations and positions to ensure that they are in line with the logic derived from the examples and the overall instructions of the ARC puzzle.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples, the transformation follows a hierarchical logic:\n1.  **Decomposition:** The input grid is divided into four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). Each quadrant contains a distinct \"foreground\" object.\n2.  **Key Extraction:** One of the objects acts as a \"Key Holder\" (identifiable by containing a 2x2 arrangement of four distinct \"intruder\" colors). The spatial arrangement of these intruder colors defines the coloring of the output objects.\n    *   Top-Left Intruder -> Color for the Top-Left Object.\n    *   Top-Right Intruder -> Color for the Top-Right Object.\n    *   Bottom-Left Intruder -> Color for the Bottom-Left Object.\n    *   Bottom-Right Intruder -> Color for the Bottom-Right Object.\n3.  **Transformation & Assembly:** The output grid is constructed by transforming and assembling the four objects:\n    *   **Canvas Size:** The output width is the sum of the width of the TL object and the *height* of the TR object (implying 90\u00b0 rotation). The output height is the sum of the height of the TL object and the height of the BL object.\n    *   **Top-Left (TL) Object:** Copied as-is (no rotation) to the top-left corner (0,0). Colored with the TL-key color.\n    *   **Top-Right (TR) Object:** Rotated 90\u00b0 Clockwise and placed adjacent to the right of the TL object. Colored with the TR-key color.\n    *   **Bottom-Left (BL) Object:** Copied as-is (no rotation) and placed adjacent below the TL object. Colored with the BL-key color.\n    *   **Bottom-Right (BR) Object:** Rotated 90\u00b0 Clockwise and placed in the bottom-right corner of the canvas. Colored with the BR-key color. Priority is given to this object in case of overlaps (inferred from Example 1).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **TL Object:** Maroon shape (containing Key). Shape is a 10x8 rectangle. Key colors: 3 (TL), 6 (TR), 4 (BL), 8 (BR). **Output TL:** Color 3 (Green), Size 10x8.\n*   **TR Object:** Grey shape. A \"tree\" pointing up (Stem 2px wide, Cap triangle). Bounding box 10x12. **Output TR:** Rotated 90\u00b0 CW (pointing right). Color 6 (Pink). Position starts at column 10.\n*   **BL Object:** Orange shape. A \"flag\" (3x6). **Output BL:** Color 4 (Yellow). Position starts at row 8.\n*   **BR Object:** Red shape. A right triangle (6x4). **Output BR:** Rotated 90\u00b0 CW. Color 8 (Teal). Positioned in the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n      4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8\n      4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0\n      4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0\n      4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"20\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this ARC task, I need to understand the transformation from the examples:\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.

The goal is to take a grid of numbers and output a smaller, dense grid with the zeros removed. The key is in understanding how to find and recombine \"unique container objects,\" which seem to involve a 2x2 mosaic of distinct colors.\n\nSo, first thing's first, I gotta define the process. I see that the input grids use numbers from 0-9. The output is a smaller grid without zeros. Based on the instructions and the examples, I see I need to do a few things:\n1.  **Identify a unique \"container object.\"** This object will surround a 2x2 block of four different numbers (let's call them colors). I need to extract these colors (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) from the block.\n2.  **Combine the container and its contents**. I need to merge the shapes of this \"container\" (the object) with the enclosed content, and then re-color it all with the color from the top-left of the 2x2 mosaic. This becomes the \"TL piece.\"\n3.  **Find the other objects.** Identify all the distinct, connected objects in the input.\n4.  **Order by size.** Sort these other objects by their area (number of pixels). Assign them new \"keys\" based on their size: the smallest object becomes the BL key, the middle the TR key, and the largest the BR key.\n5.  **Calculate the output size.** Determine N by finding the square root of the total non-zero input pixels, and build an N x N grid.\n6.  **Tessellate the grid.** Finally, I take the newly created TL, TR, BL, and BR shapes, and arrange them to fill an N x N square, allowing for rotations or translations if needed to make them fit.\n\nLet's verify this logic against the examples.\n\n**Examining Example 1:**\nI'm looking at the first example to validate my thought process. There's a red shape (color 2) that contains what looks like that 2x2 \"mosaic.\" Rows 2 and 3 contain:\n```\n2 1 5 2\n2 8 9 0\n```\nSo, the 2x2 mosaic is the numbers:\n```\n1 5\n8 9\n```\nKeys: TL=1, TR=5, BL=8, BR=9.\nThe container is the red shape around that mosaic (color 2). I combine these to make a 1 region after re-coloring. Let's count it out: if I re-color the container, plus all contained pixels, there are about 15 pixels in total. It becomes a 5x5 block with a bite taken out, 15 pixels. So if I re-color the container to TL key (1), I should get a region of 1's of that shape.\nThe other objects are an orange shape (7) of size 12, a Yellow shape (4) with area 27, and a Green shape (3) with an area 11.\nSorting by area:\nGreen (3) = 11 (BL key 8).\nOrange (7) = 12 (TR key 5).\nYellow (4) = 27 (BR key 9).\n\nTotal count is 15+11+12+27 = 65 pixels.\nIs the output 8x8? Yes. It's 64.  So there is one extra pixel! After re-counting, I see that the object area calculations are slightly off. It's 15+11+12+26 = 64 pixels exactly. The output shape is 8x8 exactly. I now have confidence this works.\n\nThe tessellation places a color 1 object (red shape plus inclusions).\n\nSo, the next step is now to apply this knowledge to the input grid.\n\n**Applying the Logic to the Test Input:**\nI'm looking for this 2x2 mosaic in the provided input grid. I see:\n```\n...9,3,6,9...\n...9,4,8,9...\n```\nAh! There's my mosaic, the numbers 3, 6, 4, and 8. The container, which encloses this 2x2 block, is the '9' shape.  Let's work through it.\nKeys: TL = 3, TR = 6, BL = 4, BR = \n\nTo solve the ARC task, I will identify the objects in the input grid, determine their roles based on the transformation rules (Container, TL/TR/BL/BR pieces), and construct the output grid by tessellating these objects.\n\n**1. Analyze the Input Objects**\nThe input grid contains four distinct connected components (objects) on a background of 0:\n*   **Object A (Key 9):** A large shape constructed of 9s, containing a 2x2 mosaic of distinct colors (3, 6, 4, 8) at `input[5][4]`, `input[5][5]`, `input[6][4]`, `input[6][5]`.\n    *   **Mosaic Colors:** Top-Left (TL)=3, Top-Right (TR)=6, Bottom-Left (BL)=4, Bottom-Right (BR)=8.\n    *   **Role:** This is the **Container**. According to the rules, it merges with its inclusions. We treat the container shape as the mask of the 9s plus the inclusions.\n    *   **Color Assignment:** Merged object becomes the **TL Key Color (3)**.\n    *   **Shape:** It occupies rows 4-11 and columns 3-12 (approx). We will extract its exact mask.\n\n*   **Object B (Key 5):** A very large connected region of 5s.\n    *   **Area:** Count of pixels is 62.\n    *   **Role:** Largest of the non-container objects -> **BR Key Color (8)**.\n\n*   **Object C (Key 2):** A triangle-like shape of 2s.\n    *   **Area:** Count of pixels is 18.\n    *   **Role:** Middle area -> **TR Key Color (6)**.\n\n*   **Object D (Key 7):** A rectangular/L-shape of 7s.\n    *   **Area:** Count of pixels is 12.\n    *   **Role:** Smallest area -> **BL Key Color (4)**.\n\n**2. Transformation Logic**\n*   **Grid Size:** Total non-zero pixels = 52 (Container) + 62 (Fives) + 18 (Twos) + 12 (Sevens) = 144. Output size is $\\sqrt{144} = 12 \\times 12$.\n*   **Target Layout:**\n    *   **TL Quadrant:** Container Shape (Color 3).\n    *   **TR Quadrant:** Twos Shape (Color 6).\n    *   **BL Quadrant:** Sevens Shape (Color 4).\n    *   **BR Quadrant:** Fives Shape (Color 8).\n    *   The objects must tessellate (fit together without overlap or gaps) to form the 12x12 square. Rotations are allowed.\n\n**3. Tessellation Strategy**\n*   **Container (Color 3):** Placed at (0,0). It occupies the top-left heavily. Its shape has a \"bite\" taken out of the right side and bottom.\n*   **Twos (Color 6):** The input shape is a right triangle. Rotating it 180 degrees allows it to fit perfectly into the \"bite\" on the right side of the Container (rows 2-5).\n*   **Sevens (Color 4):** The input shape is a 3x6 block (top half 3-wide, bottom half 1-wide).

The core is to map shapes onto a new grid. I need to take the input and transform it into a well-defined output, based on a few rules and examples.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the input and break it down. It's a grid with shapes of different colors, on a black background. The output is a smaller solid grid with tessellated shapes. I've got two examples to guide me. I noticed I need to identify the objects by color and shape. There's a special object to start with: the container object, which encloses a 2x2 mosaic of distinct colors. Inside, the container's the shape formed by the enclosing color, plus the inner colors. I'm calling the colors inside \"keys\".\n\nThe task seems to be about decomposing the input into parts, re-coloring those parts, and then fitting them into a new grid. This involves shape extraction, area calculation, sorting, and geometric placement. Based on the examples, I know that the areas of shapes need to be computed and then used for the final structure. The largest shapes are used for anchor positions and the smaller shapes are placed around them. I can assume the final structure is a regular square shape, that's being created by tessellation.\n\nThe \"container\" object is special. It's identified by its enclosed mosaic. So I need to go through the objects in the input, find one with a mosaic inside, and assign it a color based on the top-left key color in the mosaic.\n\nThe \"other\" objects are sorted by their area. Smallest -> Bottom-Left. Middle -> Top-Right. Largest -> Bottom-Right. The final output is formed by tessellating these pieces. So, I must extract the 4 shapes and map them to keys, using the calculated area.\n\nThe tessellation part is about fitting the transformed shapes into the final square. Based on examples, I need to fit the new colors into corners of the grid. It's about combining colors and shapes together to form the new square. The examples tell me that the shapes will be translated, and potentially rotated to fit.\n\nFor the new shapes, I can visualize this as a mapping operation from the source shapes to a new set of shapes on the new grid. I then need to place them in the correct quadrant/corner based on their calculated areas and color assignments, from the key colors.\n\nSo, I need to:\n1.  Parse Input to extract all shapes and colors.\n2.  Find the mosaic container. Get the keys. Merge this shape.\n3.  Calculate Areas. Sort Shapes by Area. Assign Quadrants.\n4.  Generate Output Grid by filling the quadrants with the final shapes.\n\nBased on the prompt's hint \"TL piece at top-left, TR piece at top-right...\", that suggests a fixed top-left placement. The shapes might have to be rotated.\nI'm ready to apply this to the new test input. Let's start with parsing the shapes and object area calculations.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the input and the transformation rules derived from the examples:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects & Keys**:\n    *   **Object A**: The large maroon container (color 9) with inclusions (3, 6, 4, 8).\n        *   Mosaic colors: TL=3 (Green), TR=6 (Magenta), BL=4 (Yellow), BR=8 (Teal).\n        *   Container A merges with inclusions and takes the **TL Key (3, Green)**.\n        *   Area of A: ~52 pixels.\n    *   **Object B**: The large grey object (color 5). Area ~62 pixels.\n        *   Largest of the other three -> **BR Key (8, Teal)**.\n    *   **Object D**: The red object (color 2). Area 18 pixels.\n        *   Middle sized -> **TR Key (6, Magenta)**.\n    *   **Object C**: The orange object (color 7). Area 12 pixels.\n        *   Smallest -> **BL Key (4, Yellow)**.\n\n2.  **Determine Output Size**:\n    *   Total Area = 52 + 62 + 18 + 12 = 144 pixels.\n    *   Output Grid is $\\sqrt{144} \\times \\sqrt{144} = 12 \\times 12$.\n\n3.  **Tessellation**:\n    *   **TL (Green, 3)**: Corresponds to Object A. It is placed in the top-left. Its shape (width 10, height 8 with gaps) anchors the tessellation.\n    *   **TR (Magenta, 6)**: Corresponds to Object D. It fills the top-right corner and the voids left by A's shape.\n    *   **BR (Teal, 8)**: Corresponds to Object B. It is a large, complex piece that interlocks with A and fills the bottom-right.\n    *   **BL (Yellow, 4)**: Corresponds to Object C. It fills the remaining space in the bottom-left.\n\n    *Reconstructed Layout*:\n    *   Rows 0-1: Green (10 wide), Magenta (2 wide).\n    *   Rows 2-3: Green (4 wide), Magenta (4 wide, filling A's gap), Green (2 wide), Magenta (2 wide).\n    *   Rows 4-7: Complex interlocking of Green and Magenta/Teal.\n    *   Rows 8-11: Teal (dominant in BR) and Yellow (dominant in BL).\n\n    Based on the standard ARC constraints where shapes tessellate cleanly to form the final square, the resulting grid is constructed below.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6\n3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6\n      3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6\n      3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"26\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_6_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n\n1. **Find the container with 2\u00d72 mosaic**: In the test input, the color 9 region (rows 4-11, cols 3-12) contains a 2\u00d72 mosaic at positions (5,4)-(6,5):\n   - TL=3, TR=6, BL=4, BR=8\n\n2. **Identify other objects and count pixels**:\n   - Container (color 9 + interior): 52 pixels \u2192 becomes color 3\n   - Color 5 shape: 62 pixels (largest) \u2192 becomes BR color 8\n   - Color 2 shape: 18 pixels (middle) \u2192 becomes TR color 6  \n   - Color 7 shape: 12 pixels (smallest) \u2192 becomes BL color 4\n\n3. **Calculate output size**: Total pixels = 52+62+18+12 = 144 = 12\u00b2, so output is 12\u00d712\n\n4. **Tessellation**: The container shape defines the TL region:\n   - Rows 0-1: 10 columns (cols 0-9)\n   - Rows 2-3: cols 0-3 and 8-9 (6 pixels each)\n   - Row 4: cols 0-1 and 8-9; Row 5: cols 0-1\n   - Rows 6-7: cols 0-6 (7 each)\n\nThe gaps within the container shape get filled by BR (color 8), TR fills the right edge, and BL fills the bottom-left corner.

The goal is to transform one grid into another. Let's analyze the first example.\n\nI started by looking at the input and output grids. The input has four distinct shapes, each with a different color. The output is smaller and seems to be a combination of colored regions. The output colors (1, 5, 8, 9) correspond to specific pixels within the input grid's top-left shape (red, in this case). The arrangement of these colors in the input seems to relate to the positions of the shapes on the larger grid.\n\nInitially, I thought the output shapes were scaled-up versions of the input shapes. However, they don't exactly match. The shapes in the output seem to be \"pasted\" together to form an 8x8 grid. There's a mapping: input shape to output region, and the color of each output region is determined by the \"code\" inside the red shape.  The output grid is a puzzle of these colored regions. The colors seem to be based on a 2x2 block within the red shape, with their positions indicating which shape gets which color.  The task involved a transformation where the shapes were reorganized and the colors were replaced by the \"code\" pixels.\n\nI then moved onto the second example. The shapes were in different colors and positions, but the basic idea remained the same: input shapes transformed into output regions based on a 2x2 \"code\" block inside the top-left shape. I noticed the output size was 10x10, the input was 20x20. I began to form a hypothesis: could the input shapes be scaled by a factor of 2?  In other words, a 2x2 block of input pixels becomes one pixel in the output. I tried testing this theory, but quickly realized it didn't fully explain the transformations. The sizes and number of pixels in the input and output shapes didn't proportionally align with the 2x2 to 1x1 scaling hypothesis.\n\nIt seemed like the task required removing the empty space.  In Ex 2, there was an irregular shape (grey) that was not a perfect rectangle, so the scaling wasn't a simple ratio. Removing the black space still left the input grid size to be something other than the output grid size. Also the shapes in the inputs had \"holes\" (such as the pink shape in Example 2 which contained the code pixels). But in the outputs, those holes where replaced by the solid color of the shape, or code's color.\n\nMoving to the test input, and reexamining how the 2x2 block related to the shape position and corresponding colors.  I confirmed the color assignment logic. The shapes in the output seemed to be a collage of the shapes. \n\nI discarded simple rules about scaling or rotation and instead focused on bounding boxes.  By bounding boxes, I mean that the output had dimensions to fit the input shapes' combined area, and that the shapes filled the space perfectly in the output.\n\nAfter further analysis, I began to think the output grid was a transformed, possibly resized version of the input layout.  The shapes might be simply moved and re-sized to fit together, and the output colors depend on the mapping from those 2x2 code pixel blocks.\n\nI identified the key aspects.  I believed the output size might be derived from a relationship between the \"code block,\" or sum of widths and heights or some combination of dimensions. The canvas size of the output might be related to the source dimensions, possibly the combined size or bounding box size of the shapes. This lead to trying different calculations of bounding box dimensions and relating them to each example's sizes.\n\nI needed an example of how the shapes would be joined in the output. I also realized that some shapes had similar pixel structure, such as the two shapes resembling an \"L\" shape. After calculating the dimension of bounding boxes and adding to create the output dimensions, I came to the conclusion, I could map the shapes from the input to the output.\n\nI hypothesized there was a specific transformation rule. I concluded the output was a collage of the four input shapes. I considered removing empty rows/cols in the input to produce an output grid. I had to solve a series of examples, so I could use them to test the output's size.  I deduced that the output size was half of the input size: 26 -> 13.\nI created a plan to construct a 20x20 output grid.\n\nI decided that, since the inputs have gaps, and the output is a closed block, I needed to fill the gaps. The gaps between the shapes were an important detail. I hypothesized that the final shape would be a collage with the code colours within the shapes. I concluded that I needed to\n\nThe problem asks us to transform an input grid containing four colored shapes into a smaller output grid composed of four colored regions. The transformation involves three main steps: determining the output colors, determining the output grid size, and mapping the shape geometries.\n\n**1. Color Mapping Strategy**\nIn each example, the top-left \"container\" shape holds a 2x2 block of \"code\" pixels that dictate the color palette for the output.\n*   **Example 1:** The Red (2) container has inner pixels: `1, 5` (top row) and `8, 9` (bottom row).\n    *   Top-Left (TL) shape maps to Top-Left code color: Red shape -> **1 (Blue)**.\n    *   Top-Right (TR) shape maps to Top-Right code color: Orange shape -> **5 (Grey)**.\n    *   Bottom-Left (BL) shape maps to Bottom-Left code color: Yellow shape -> **8 (Teal)**.\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR) shape maps to Bottom-Right code color: Green shape -> **9 (Maroon)**.\n\n*   **Example 2:** The Pink (6) container has inner pixels `2, 4` and `8, 3`.\n    *   TL Pink shape -> **2 (Red)**.\n    *   TR Grey shape -> **4 (Yellow)**.\n    *   BL Maroon shape -> **8 (Teal)**.\n    *   BR Blue shape -> **3 (Green)**.\n\n*   **Test Input:** The Maroon (9) container has inner pixels `3, 6` and `4, 8`.\n    *   TL Maroon shape -> **3 (Green)**.\n    *   TR Grey shape -> **6 (Pink)**.\n    *   BL Orange shape -> **4 (Yellow)**.\n    *   BR Red shape -> **8 (Teal)**.\n\n**2. Geometry and Grid Size**\nThe output grid appears to be constructed by removing the empty rows and columns that separate the four shapes in the input grid. This effectively \"squeezes\" the shapes together.\n*   **Test Input Analysis:**\n    *   **Columns:** The TL and BL shapes occupy columns 3-12 (width 10). The TR and BR shapes occupy columns 16-25 (width 10). There is a gap of 3 columns (13-15). Removing the gap results in a width of 10 + 10 = **20**.\n    *   **Rows:** The TL and TR shapes occupy rows 4-17 (height 14). The BL and BR shapes occupy rows 19-24 (height 6).

My focus is on understanding the underlying logic to generate the output from the input.\n\n**Initial Impressions:**\n\n*   I need to analyze how the input grid is transformed into the output grid.\n*   Two examples are given to provide hints for solving a single test case.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\n*   The input grid is divided into four regions containing distinct shapes (shapes 2, 7, 4, and 3).\n*   There's a special object containing a key (a 2x2 block with unique colors).\n*   The output grid contains solid shapes of unique colors.\n*   The \"key\" likely drives how shapes are translated to the colors of the output, but the exact mapping is unclear.\n*   The shapes in the output grid appear to correspond to solidified versions of the input shapes.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n\n*   I'll identify the four main input shapes.\n*   Figure out the output color of each region based on the position of each shape relative to the key inside the special TL shape.\n*   The \"key\" pixels in the special object determine the output color of each shape based on its location in the input.\n*   Each output region's color matches a color in the key object's 2x2 block.\n\n**Testing Hypothesis:**\n\n*   I need to check how the input shapes map to the output shapes and colors.\n*   I'll analyze the shapes and their bounding boxes and see if there are any rotations or translations applied.\n*   I realize that the shapes appear to be **packed** into the output grid.\n*   The output grid's size isn't obviously the sum of input shapes, but they touch to fill the 8x8 space.\n\n**Refining Logic:**\n\n*   I'll need to figure out how to arrange the shapes based on the color mapping. The shapes' positions in the output seem tied to the shapes' relative position with respect to the key in the input.\n*   The size of the output is determined by fitting these shapes together.\n*   There's no overlap in the output (shapes are pushed to touch).\n*   I see that the output can be constructed by drawing the shapes (solid) and coloring based on position relative to the special key object.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   I extend my theory to cover the second example.\n*   I test whether this \"quadrant\" hypothesis is still valid.\n*   I re-examine the Key object (in this example, it's not at the top-left).\n*   I confirm the color mapping principle remains the same.\n*   I test that solidified shapes are being transformed.\n*   I notice some shapes are rotated (to better fit).\n*   I test whether shape geometry is preserved.\n\n**Formulating the Rules:**\n\n*   Identify the 4 shapes and extract them.\n*   Apply the key (solidify shapes and recolor according to position).\n*   Arrange the 4 shapes into a solid rectangle (no whitespace).\n\n**New Insights:**\n\n*   The shapes in the output are all rectangular or \"filled-in\" shapes from the input.\n*   There's no blank space in the output.\n*   I need to find a way to place the shapes that maximizes the \"touching\" and fills the whole area.\n*   I am able to deduce that for Ex 1, rotating the TR shape helped the shapes fit.\n\n**Test Input Approach:**\n\n*   I'll identify the four shapes and extract them from the Test Input.\n*   I identify the key colors (3, 6, 4, 8) and assign them to the regions.\n*   I note that the height of each quadrant in the output is probably going to be equal to the corresponding shape (although this has not been consistent).\n*   I'll use the shapes to generate a final output (pushing the shapes into a grid).\n*   I try to create a grid with width 20, but the best approach is to have width equal to the combined width of the solid shape after rotating. This might result in scaling.\n\n**Final Plan and Test:**\n\n*   Generate the final layout.\n*   Apply rotation (or simply placement with color fills if there's sufficient space).\n*   I make a table to generate the 20x20 Output (applying the derived logic).\n*   I check whether BL/BR shapes should be cropped.\n*   I generate the final output and color the grid as 20x20, using the solid shapes.\n\nThe final output is a \n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid into an output grid based on the pattern established in the solved examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid contains four distinct shapes positioned roughly in the four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n2.  **Key Identification:** One of the shapes (the Top-Left one in all examples) contains a 2x2 \"key\" of pixels with different colors. This key acts as a color map for the output.\n    *   The 2x2 key layout `[[TL_color, TR_color], [BL_color, BR_color]]` determines the fill color for the four shapes based on their quadrant.\n    *   Top-Left Shape $\\rightarrow$ becomes `TL_color`.\n    *   Top-Right Shape $\\rightarrow$ becomes `TR_color`.\n    *   Bottom-Left Shape $\\rightarrow$ becomes `BL_color`.\n    *   Bottom-Right Shape $\\rightarrow$ becomes `BR_color`.\n3.  **Geometry and Assembly:**\n    *   The output grid combines these four shapes into a single rectangular (specifically square) block.\n    *   The shapes effectively form a tiling or packing of the output square.\n    *   The dimensions of the output grid seem to be determined by the sum of the widths of the top two shapes (Top-Left + Top-Right) and maintaining a square aspect ratio (or fitting the heights).\n    *   In the test input:\n        *   **Top-Left Object (Source Color 9):** A 10x8 solid block.\n        *   **Top-Right Object (Source Color 5):** A 10x12 solid block.\n        *   **Bottom-Left Object (Source Color 7):** A smaller shape.\n        *   **Bottom-Right Object (Source Color 2):** A smaller shape.\n    *   The Key inside the Top-Left object is:\n        ```\n        3 6\n        4 8\n        ```\n        *   TL Target Color: **3 (Green)**.\n        *   TR Target Color: **6 (Magenta)**.\n        *   BL Target Color: **4 (Yellow)**.\n        *   BR Target Color: **8 (Light Blue)**.\n4.  **Layout Construction:**\n    *   The output width is the sum of the widths of the top two blocks: $10 + 10 = 20$.\n    *   The output height is inferred to be a square matching the width, so $20 \\times 20$.\n    *   **Top-Left (Green):** Occupies the top-left corner. Dimensions 10x8.\n    *   **Top-Right (Magenta):** Occupies the top-right corner. Dimensions 10x12.\n    *   **Bottom-Left (Yellow):** Fills the remaining space below the Top-Left block. Space starts at row 8. Dimensions 10x(20-8) = 10x12.\n    *   **Bottom-Right (Light Blue):** Fills the remaining space below the Top-Right block. Space starts at row 12.
