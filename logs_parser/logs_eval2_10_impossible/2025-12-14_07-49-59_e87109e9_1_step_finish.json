model_id=\"gemini-3-high_1_step_1\">\n**Alright, let's break down this ARC problem. I'm faced with deciphering a pattern across three examples and a test case, all of which involve a grid where color is crucial.**\n\nMy initial thoughts are to understand the layout. I see a clear structure: a header with instructions, and a map/maze below. The header seems to define rules for how color 8 (teal, the \"fluid\") behaves.  I'm focusing on how the non-source colors (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) in the header influence this fluid, the direction or displacement, or how they interact.\n\nI see that the Header has distinct regions defined for different colors. I begin by analyzing each sample and identify the relationship between the colors and directions defined in the header, and how they interact with where color 8 is.  \n\nI have to look for any correlation between the position of non-zero numbers in each Header and the directions the \"fluid\" 8 travels. It looks like the Header has direction and that direction impacts the behavior of 8s (the \"wind\"). It\u2019s like a conveyor belt, or maybe the regions create a \"gravity\" that pulls 8s.\n\nThe map also matters. The header is how the non-source colors transform color 8.  I believe the 8s are being moved by the header rule.   In some cases, the direction seems to be a consistent shift (left or right, above/below the source cells), while in others, there's a more local effect.\n\nI realized that The source color (8s) has a fixed location in each example and has a specific relationship between source rows and the non-source areas.  I think the source's behavior depends on its relative position to the header rules.  \n\nThe problem has both fill and clone behavior. I have to create an algorithm for how to decide between fill and clone.\n\nAfter going back and forth, I am now confident about the following:\n\n*   **Source Propagation:** Teal 8s exist at a Source position\n*   **Horizontal Influence**: I have rules for where 8s go:\n    *   **Inside/Overlapping Region:** If direction is Right, fill to right edge. If Left, fill to left edge.\n    *   **Remote Region (Clone):** If \"downwind\" of source (wind from region to source), clone near region. If \"upwind\" - No clone.\n* **Global Wind Direction**: A global wind flips direction below the Source rows.\n\nMy prediction is to create these rules for each test. For each row: Identify the regions. Does it overlap? Apply those rules and generate the outcome. Then I'll test the solution.\n\n\nThe transformation depends on the interaction between \"colored regions\" defined in the grid and a set of \"wind directions\" defined in the header rows (rows 1-4). A source of teal color (8) exists in the grid (defined by the `8`s in the input). The regions \"blow\" the teal color based on their assigned direction, creating clones or filling spaces.\n\n**Rules:**\n1.  **Header Parsing:**\n    *   The top section (between grey `5` lines) contains 4 blocks, each representing a rule for a specific color.\n    *   The position of the non-zero color within the block `0,0,0,0` determines the direction.\n    *   Mapping:\n        *   Position 0 (e.g., `1,0,0,0`): **Left**.\n        *   Position 3 (e.g., `0,0,0,1`): **Right**.\n\n2.  **Source Identification:**\n    *   Identify the columns containing the teal `8`s in the input. These are the **Source Columns**.\n\n3.  **Wind Direction Logic:**\n    *   The grid is divided vertically relative to the Source Rows (rows containing the original `8`s).\n    *   **Above Source Rows:** Regions respect the directions defined in the header.\n    *   **Below Source Rows:** Regions **invert** their directions (Left becomes Right, Right becomes Left).\n    *   **Source Rows:** Directions act to \"Pull\" or \"Fill\" if conditions are met (often acting as barriers or filling space between opposed winds).\n\n4.  **Effect on Teal (8s):**\n    *   **Cloning (Remote Interaction):** If a region's active wind direction blows *towards* the Source Columns (i.e., Region is on the Right and blowing Left, or Region is on the Left and blowing Right), it creates a copy of the Source 8s adjacent to the region on the windward side.\n    *   **Filling (Inside/Overlapping Interaction):** If the Source Columns are *inside* or *overlapping* a region, the wind \"smears\" the 8s in the active direction to the edge of the grid (or until hitting another region).\n    *   **Default:** The Source 8s always remain in their original columns.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Header:**\n    *   Block 1: `1,0,0,0` -> **Color 1 is Left**.\n    *   Block 2: `0,0,0,3` -> **Color 3 is Right**.\n    *   Block 3: `2,0,0,0` -> **Color 2 is Left**.\n    *   Block 4: `4,0,0,0` -> **Color 4 is Left**.\n*   **Source:** `8`s are at columns 8, 9, 10 in rows 13-15.\n*   **Transformation by Row Segments:**\n    *   **Rows 6-8 (Above Source):**\n        *   Contains Region 2 (cols 0-20) and Region 3 (cols 21-23).\n        *   **Region 2 (Left):** Source (8-10) is inside. Fill Left -> Fills columns **0-10**.\n        *   **Region 3 (Right):** Blows away from source. No effect.\n        *   *Result:* 8s in cols 0-10.\n    *   **Rows 9-11 (Above Source):**\n        *   Contains Region 9 (BG) and Region 3 (cols 21-23).\n        *   **Region 3 (Right):** Blows away from source. No effect.\n        *   *Result:* 8s in cols 8-10 (Source only).\n    *   **Rows 12 (Above Source):**\n        *   Contains Region 1 (0-2) and Region 3 (21-23).\n        *   **Region 1 (Left):** Blows away from source.\n        *   **Region 3 (Right):** Blows away from source.\n        *   *Result:* 8s in cols 8-10.\n    *   **Rows 13-15 (Source Rows):**\n        *   Contains Region 1 (0-2) and Region 3 (21-23).\n        *   Both blow away (Left/Right). No filling \"suction\" generated in this configuration (unlike Ex 2).\n        *   *Result:* 8s in cols 8-10.\n    *   **Rows 16-21 (Below Source -> Invert Directions):**\n        *   Contains Region 1 (0-2) and Region 3 (21-23).\n        *   **Region 1 (Left -> Right):** Blows towards Source (from 2 to 8). Creates **Clone** adjacent to Region 1 (cols 3, 4, 5).\n        *   **Region 3 (Right -> Left):** Blows towards Source (from 21 to 8). Creates **Clone** adjacent to Region 3 (cols 18, 19, 20).\n        *   *Result:* 8s in cols 3-5, 8-10, 18-20.\n    *   **Row 22 (Below Source):**\n        *   Only Region 9. No active regions.\n        *   *Result:* 8s in cols 8-10.\n    *   **Rows 23-25 (Below Source -> Invert Directions):**\n        *   Contains Region 4 (cols 7-15).\n        *   **Region 4 (Left -> Right):** Source (8-10) is inside. Fill Right -> Fills columns **8-23** (to right edge).\n        *   *Result:* 8s in cols 8-23.\n\noutput:\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 0>\n<CANDIDATE 1>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 49x24\n333333338833333388333333\n333333338833333388333333\n333333338833333388333333\n111133338833333388333333\n111133338833333388444433\n111133338833333388444433\n111133338833333388444433\n111188888888888888444433\n111188888888888888444433\n111188338833333333444433\n111188338833333333444433\n111188338833333333333333\n333388338833333333333333\n333388338833333333333333\n333388888888888888888888\n333388888888888888888888\n333322222222222333333333\n333322222222222333333333\n333322222222222333333333\n555555555555555555555555\n510005500035520005540005\n510005500035520005540005\n510005500035520005540005\n510005500035520005540005\n555555555555555555555555\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n999888888888888888888333\n999888888888888888888333\n999888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888999\n111999999999999999999999\n111999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_4_step_1\">\n**The Grand ARC Task Unveiling**\n\nOkay, so I'm staring down this ARC task, and it's time to break it down. My initial assessment? It's all about geometric transformation within a grid. Think of it like a puzzle with rules baked in.\n\n**Initial Impressions:**\n\n*   **Grid Size:** They're big, around 25x24 or 30x25.\n*   **Sections:** Grids are divided into distinct regions.\n*   **The Key:** There's this 6-row \"key\" section at the top, separated by a horizontal gray line, which seems to be the instruction manual.\n\n**The Key Decoded (Hopefully):**\n\n*   **Patterns:** It seems the key translates color into action and direction.\n*   **Example Analysis:** Each color acts as \"wall\" for the expanding color, and the patterns inside those horizontal spans are what direct the action.\n*   **Wall Logic:** If a shape is present on the left of 4x4, it means left movement is restricted.\n*   **Flood Fill / Region Growing:** The unique color (let's call it the \"expander\") \"fills\" the space, but it stops when it encounters a different color (the \"walls\").\n*   **Key Insight:** Key colors are walls and direct the expansion.\n\n**Expanding Region's Secrets (The \"Expander\"):**\n\n*   **The Source:** Color 8 is often the one expanding and is not present in the key.\n*   **Rules:** The key's rules guide the expansion, with all 8s bounded by all walls.\n*   **No Leakage (Or So I Thought):** I'm trying to figure out why 8s stop at their walls.\n*   **Geometry / Region Expansion:** The bounding box, or perhaps the convex hull, determines the extent of the 8s.\n*   **It's all about region:** The key shows a \"bounding box\".\n*   **Coordinate Check and Bounding Box:** I should use wall location to define fill limits.\n*   **Intersection of half planes**: Walls represent boundaries of a polygon. 8s can be present within this defined area.\n\n**Putting It All Together (The Solution):**\n\n*   **Bounding Box:** Define a box based on the walls.\n*   **Flood Fill:** Turn all empty space (background) inside the box into the expander color.\n*   **Stripes?** Based on the examples it looks like there aren't any.\n*   **No Overwriting:** Walls and the existing shape must be maintained.\n*   **Final Solution:** Change the background (9s or 7s) to the unique expanding color (8s) only within the bounding box. The wall logic is key!\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation logic from the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Task:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:**\n    *   The grid consists of a \"Header\" (Rows 0-5) and a \"Main Grid\" (Rows 6+).\n    *   The Header acts as a **Key** or instruction set. Rows 1-4 contain vertical bars of colors separated by grey (5) columns.\n    *   The Main Grid contains obstacles (colored regions), a background color (usually varying, 9 in the test case), and a \"seed\" of 8s (Teal) that expands.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic (Inferred from Examples):**\n    *   The transformation is a **Flood Fill** operation of color **8** starting from the initial 8-block.\n    *   The fill is constrained by a **Bounding Box** defined by the surrounding \"Wall\" colors.\n    *   **The Key's Role:** The key specifies properties for each wall color. Specifically, it seems to define \"Stripes\" or \"Extensions\" of 8s.\n        *   In Example 3, we see vertical stripes of 8s extending the full height of the grid, adjacent to the vertical walls.\n        *   The side of the stripe is determined by the Key code:\n            *   Code `C 0 0 0` (Left column filled) implies an effect related to the \"Negative\" direction (Left or Up).\n            *   Code `0 0 0 C` (Right column filled) implies an effect related to the \"Positive\" direction (Right or Down).\n        *   Specifically, for Vertical Walls:\n            *   **Key Right (`0 0 0 C`)**: Creates a vertical stripe of 8s on the **Right** (Positive X) side of the wall.\n            *   **Key Left (`C 0 0 0`)**: Creates a vertical stripe of 8s on the **Left** (Negative X) side of the wall.\n            *   These stripes appear even if they are \"outside\" the central room, provided they are within grid boundaries.\n    *   **The Fill Logic:**\n        *   The 8s fill the rectangular region defined by the intersection of the \"inner faces\" of the walls.\n        *   Left Boundary: Determined by the rightmost edge of Left Walls.\n        *   Right Boundary: Determined by the leftmost edge of Right Walls.\n        *   Top Boundary: Determined by the bottom edge of Top Walls.\n        *   Bottom Boundary: Determined by the top edge of Bottom Walls.\n        *   The fill does not \"leak\" through diagonal gaps in the corners (as seen in Example 3). It strictly fills the logical bounding box.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Walls:**\n        *   **Color 2 (Red):** Top Wall (Rows 6-8). Spans Cols 0-20.\n        *   **Color 1 (Blue):** Left Wall (Rows 12-22). Spans Cols 0-2.\n        *   **Color 3 (Green):** Right Wall (Rows 6-21). Spans Cols 21-23.\n        *   **Color 4 (Yellow):** Bottom Wall (Rows 23-25). Spans Cols 7-15.\n    *   **Key:**\n        *   **1:** `1 0 0 0` (Left).\n        *   **3:** `0 0 0 3` (Right).\n        *   **2:** `2 0 0 0` (Left).\n        *   **4:** `4 0 0 0` (Left).\n    *   **Bounding Box for Fill:**\n        *   **Top:** Below Wall 2 -> Row 9.\n        *   **Bottom:** Above Wall 4 -> Row 22.\n        *   **Left:** Right of Wall 1 -> Col 3.\n        *   **Right:** Left of Wall 3 -> Col 20.\n        *   **Fill Region:** Rows 9 to 22, Columns 3 to 20.\n    *   **Stripes Analysis:**\n        *   **Wall 1 (Left):** Key Left -> Stripe on Left. Wall is at x=0. Stripe would be x=-1 (Off grid). -> **No visible stripe.**\n        *   **Wall 3 (Right):** Key Right -> Stripe on Right. Wall is at x=23. Stripe would be x=24 (Off grid). -> **No visible stripe.**\n        *   **Wall 2 (Top):** Key Left (Negative/Up). Stripe Above? Off grid. -> **No visible stripe.**\n        *   **Wall 4 (Bottom):** Key Left (Negative/Up). Stripe Above (Inner)? It merges with the fill. -> **No extra visible stripe.**\n    *   **Result:**\n        *   The transformation is simply filling the rectangle **x=[3, 20], y=[9, 22]** with 8s.\n        *   Areas outside this rectangle (including the \"gaps\" at the corners, like Row 9 Cols 0-2) retain their original background color (9).\n        *   Original walls are preserved.\n\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Construction of Output:**\n1.  **Copy Header (Rows 0-5):** Identical to input.\n2.  **Rows 6-8:** Contain Wall 2 (Cols 0-20) and Wall 3 (Cols 21-23). Identical to input.\n3.  **Rows 9-11:**\n    *   Cols 0-2: Background (9).

My initial observation is that each input grid is structured into two parts: an instruction section at the top and a map or pattern section below.\n\nI started by methodically analyzing the examples, noting repeated elements. In Example 1, I saw an instruction bar containing \"blocks\" that seemed to visually encode some rules. These blocks involved colors and empty spaces, which I initially thought might represent directions. The output grid showed that wires drawn with a new color, which connected distinct regions with different colors. By carefully examining how these regions transformed, the color 8 (teal) wires connect different shapes on the lower map to each other, so the 8s were the connections.\n\nI had to re-examine the instruction format. In Example 2, I noticed that the colors in the blocks in the instruction bar seemingly link to the output by forming the \"wires\". I started to form a hypothesis that the non-zero value inside the slots might have a directional meaning, perhaps indicating where a wire should be placed relative to the central \"origin\" or central shape. In Example 2, the wire goes up, and the instruction bar pointed upward as well. This gave me the idea of an L, U, R, D mapping for wires to neighbor colors.\n\nAs I dug deeper, I realized a crucial piece: the wires were \"connecting\" objects based on *matching* colors, meaning the value in the \"instructions\" was the *color* to connect to, not the direction itself. I also noticed that the \"wires\" could have different appearances: in some cases, they are continuous lines, in others they were isolated \"markers\". The background color seemed to play a role in this \"Remote Marker\" effect.\n\nAfter some trial and error, I found the positions in the slots of a block are tied to the direction of each wire. From there, I needed to generalize my observations on Examples 1, 2, and 3, in order to make a conclusion on the rule for each position.\n\nNow that I've uncovered the core mechanic, I need to translate these findings to a concrete strategy for processing the test input. So, if I understand things correctly:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Grid:** Recognize a center region and identify its neighbors (the colors).\n2.  **Read the Instructions:** Use the instruction section to connect the center to the neighbors. Each instruction has a target (neighbor), and a direction (from L, U, R, or D).\n3.  **Construct the Output:**  Create wires between the identified neighbors by matching up the directions to their respective neighbors.\n\nFrom this investigation, I know, I need to look for matching colors in the instructions, then make the connections from the center shape in a specific way. I believe I have the right model now. Let's see if it works!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to infer a transformation rule from three solved examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Task:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:**\n    *   **Top Section (Rows 0-5):** Contains a set of \"instructions\". The rows form visual slots separated by gray (5) borders. Each slot contains a color code (and a position).\n        *   The instruction format is `5, A, B, C, D, 5`. The non-zero value represents a target color.\n        *   The sequence of instructions (Slot 1 to Slot 4) corresponds to the four cardinal directions relative to a central object in the map below.\n        *   Based on the examples and the test input, the mapping is:\n            *   **Slot 1 -> Left** neighbor.\n            *   **Slot 2 -> Right** neighbor.\n            *   **Slot 3 -> Up** neighbor.\n            *   **Slot 4 -> Down** neighbor.\n            *   *(Note: This mapping is derived specifically from the Test Input's unique set of neighbor colors 1, 3, 2, 4 matching the instruction order 1, 3, 2, 4. In other examples, the instructions simply list the colors of the neighbors present).*\n    *   **Bottom Section (Rows 6+):** A map containing:\n        *   A central block of Teal (8) pixels.\n        *   Various neighbor blocks of different colors (e.g., Blue 1, Red 2, Green 3, Yellow 4).\n        *   A background color (e.g., Green 3, Blue 1, Orange 7, Maroon 9).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   The goal is to connect the central Teal (8) block to its neighbors using Teal (8) \"wires\".\n    *   The instructions tell us which neighbors to connect to. The instructions list the colors of the neighbors in specific directions.\n    *   **Logic:** For each direction (Left, Right, Up, Down), check if there is a neighbor. If the instruction confirms the neighbor (or if the \"Find Color\" logic matches), draw a connection.\n    *   **Connection Style:**\n        *   The connection is a straight line of Teal (8) pixels.\n        *   The width/thickness of the wire matches the dimensions of the central block's face in that direction.\n        *   The wire extends from the central block through the background until it touches the target neighbor.\n    *   **Test Input Specifics:**\n        *   **Center:** Teal (8) block at Rows 13-16, Columns 8-10.\n        *   **Left Neighbor:** Blue (1) block at Cols 0-2.\n        *   **Right Neighbor:** Green (3) block at Cols 21-23.\n        *   **Up Neighbor:** Red (2) block at Rows 6-8.\n        *   **Down Neighbor:** Yellow (4) block at Rows 23-25.\n        *   **Instructions:**\n            *   Slot 1: `1` (Blue) -> Matches Left Neighbor.\n            *   Slot 2: `3` (Green) -> Matches Right Neighbor.\n            *   Slot 3: `2` (Red) -> Matches Up Neighbor.\n            *   Slot 4: `4` (Yellow) -> Matches Down Neighbor.\n        *   **Action:** Connect all four neighbors to the center.\n\n3.  **Drawing the Output:**\n    *   **Horizontal Wires:** Extend from the side of the 8-block (Rows 13-16).\n        *   **Left:** From Col 8 to Col 2 (Target). Fill Cols 3-7.\n        *   **Right:** From Col 10 to Col 21 (Target). Fill Cols 11-20.\n    *   **Vertical Wires:** Extend from the top/bottom of the 8-block (Cols 8-10).\n        *   **Up:** From Row 13 to Row 8 (Target). Fill Rows 9-12.\n        *   **Down:** From Row 16 to Row 23 (Target). Fill Rows 17-22.\n\n**Step-by-Step Construction for Test Output:**\n*   Copy input grid.\n*   **Draw Left Wire:** Set pixels at `Row[13-16]`, `Col[3-7]` to 8.\n*   **Draw Right Wire:** Set pixels at `Row[13-16]`, `Col[11-20]` to 8.\n*   **Draw Up Wire:** Set pixels at `Row[9-12]`, `Col[8-10]` to 8.\n*   **Draw Down Wire:** Set pixels at `Row[17-22]`, `Col[8-10]` to 8.\n\nThe background color 9 (Maroon) in the path areas will be replaced by 8 (Teal).\n\noutput:\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,1,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,3,5,5,2,0,0,0,5,5,4,0,0,0,5\n5,1,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,3,5,5,2,0,0,0,5,5,4,0,0,0,5\n5,1,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,3,5,5,2,0,0,0,5,5,4,0,0,0,5\n5,1,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,3,5,5,2,0,0,0,5,5,4,0,0,0,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 2>\n<CANDIDATE 3>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 24x24\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n999999998889999999999333\n999999998889999999999333\n999999998889999999999333\n111888888889999999999333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999999\n111999998889999999999999\n111999998889999999999999\n999999998889999999999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_1\">\n**Initial Assessment and Exploration**\n\nOkay, so the task at hand is an ARC problem with a grid, and it looks like I need to transform it based on some examples. The initial analysis reveals a pattern: large grids, distinct sections separated by a full row of a certain color. The top section seems to have \"instructions,\" while the bottom holds the \"map\" or game board.\n\n**Decoding the Instruction Grid**\n\nExample 1 made me realize that the top sections contain specific patterns, particularly in vertical blocks with different colors. I noticed that the sequence of these colored blocks might define an order of operation, kind of a 'path' that needs to be followed.\n\nAfter further dissection, I concluded that the instruction blocks are, in essence, a list of target colors.  This hypothesis was reinforced by the consistent pattern of these colors being present in the output grid and the colors not on the list, remaining untouched.\n\nThe \"Position\" (e.g., the position of the non-zero pixel within the 4-column block) kept appearing, so I tried to map it to a direction, trying various possibilities, like Up/Down/Left/Right, or a relative direction from the starting point. But, that wasn't working. Then, I considered it was relative to the \"Starting Point\" which is the 8. So it does not matter.\n\n**From Instructions to Pathing**\n\nThe most promising idea was that the \"Position\" (0 or 3), combined with the \"Color\", was the instruction and it specified that specific colors were targets, and the path to be modified.\n\n**Algorithm and Approach**\n\nThe logic crystallized: the top section defines the target colors, I search for these, and then paths of the starting block 8s, extend from the starting point to reach the respective target color blocks. The path is always the same width as the start block.\n\n**Refinement and Implementation**\n\nThe Test Input analysis solidified the approach. The key is now: Extract the target colors from the top section and build paths from the 3x3 block to each target, and ensure I transform all valid targets to complete the solution.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\nEach input consists of two sections:\n1.  **Top Section (Instruction Header):** The first 6 rows. It contains a border of 5s and a repeating pattern of 4 columns. Inside each 4-column block, there is a specific color (1-4, 6, etc.) and a position (the non-zero color is at one of the 4 positions). This section acts as a list of instructions.\n2.  **Bottom Section (Game Grid):** The rest of the grid. It contains a \"start\" block of color 8 (Teal) in the center, a background color, and several \"target\" regions of different colors located at the edges (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).\n\n**Rule Inference:**\n1.  **Instructions:** The Top Section lists the colors that the central 8-block must connect to.\n    *   In Example 1, colors 1, 6, 4, 2 are listed. In the grid, regions 1, 4, 2 are present (6 is missing). The output shows connections to 1, 4, and 2.\n    *   In Example 2, colors 2, 4, 6, 3 are listed. All are present. The output shows connections to all of them.\n    *   In Example 3, colors 4, 6, 3, 2 are listed. All are present. The output shows connections to all of them.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The goal is to draw a path from the central 8-block to every target color region listed in the Top Section that exists in the Bottom Section.\n\n2.  **Path Construction:**\n    *   **Color:** The path is made of color 8 (same as the start block).\n    *   **Shape:** The paths are straight lines extending from the start block to the target regions (Up, Down, Left, Right).\n    *   **Width:** The width of the path matches the dimensions of the start block.\n        *   In Examples 1-3, the start block is 2x2, and the paths are 2 pixels wide.\n        *   In the Test Input, the start block is 3x3 (rows 13-15, cols 8-10), so the paths must be 3 pixels wide/high.\n    *   **Extent:** The path extends through the empty background space until it touches the target region. It does not overwrite the target region itself.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Parse Top Section:** The header contains the colors `1`, `3`, `2`, `4`.\n    *   Block 1: `1` (Blue)\n    *   Block 2: `3` (Green)\n    *   Block 3: `2` (Red)\n    *   Block 4: `4` (Yellow)\n    *   *Instruction:* Connect the central 8-block to regions 1, 3, 2, and 4.\n\n2.  **Analyze Bottom Section:**\n    *   **Start Block (8):** Located at Rows 13-15, Columns 8-10. Dimensions are 3x3.\n    *   **Target 1 (Blue):** Located on the Left edge (Columns 0-2).\n    *   **Target 3 (Green):** Located on the Right edge (Columns 21-23).\n    *   **Target 2 (Red):** Located on the Top edge (Rows 6-8).\n    *   **Target 4 (Yellow):** Located on the Bottom edge (Rows 23-25).\n    *   **Background:** Color 9 (Maroon).\n\n3.  **Construct Paths:**\n    *   **To Top (2):** Extend a 3-wide path UP from the start block.\n        *   Columns: 8, 9, 10.\n        *   Rows: From the top of the start block (Row 13) up to the bottom of the target (Row 8).\n        *   Fill Rows 9, 10, 11, 12 with 8s.\n    *   **To Bottom (4):** Extend a 3-wide path DOWN from the start block.\n        *   Columns: 8, 9, 10.\n        *   Rows: From the bottom of the start block (Row 15) down to the top of the target (Row 23).\n        *   Fill Rows 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 with 8s.\n    *   **To Left (1):** Extend a 3-high path LEFT from the start block.\n        *   Rows: 13, 14, 15.\n        *   Columns: From the left of the start block (Col 8) left to the right of the target (Col 2).\n        *   Fill Columns 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 with 8s.\n    *   **To Right (3):** Extend a 3-high path RIGHT from the start block.\n        *   Rows: 13, 14, 15.\n        *   Columns: From the right of the start block (Col 10) right to the left of the target (Col 21).\n        *   Fill Columns 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 with 8s.\n\n4.  **Final Output:** The output consists of the Bottom Section (starting from row 6) with the added paths.\n\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

Roads have the same thickness **k**.\n\nFrom the start block, launch **four paths** (up, down, left, right).  \nEach path is simulated by sliding a **k\u00d7k cursor** one cell at a time:\n\n- As the cursor moves, paint every covered non-building cell to **8** (do not overwrite the colored rectangles; they act as reflectors).\n- When the cursor would enter a building color (1/2/3/4), it does **not** move into it; instead it **turns 90\u00b0**:\n  - if that color is \u201cturn left\u201d \u21d2 rotate direction left\n  - if \u201cturn right\u201d \u21d2 rotate direction right\n  Then continue from the same position.\n- Stop when the cursor would leave the grid.\n\nFinally, **remove the header**: the output is only the transformed body.\n\n---\n\n### Completed output grid\n\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n</REASONING_MODEL_H>\n<REASONING_MODEL_I model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_10_step_5_image\">\n### What the examples show\n\nEach input has two parts:\n\n1) **Top 6 rows = an instruction legend**  \nThey contain 4 small \u201cblack squares\u201d (color 0) surrounded by gray (5).  \nEach square has a **colored stripe** (a non\u2011zero color) either on the **left edge** or the **right edge** of the black area.\n\nFor each stripe color:\n- **stripe on the left** \u21d2 when a path hits that color, it must turn **counter\u2011clockwise** (a \u201cleft turn\u201d).\n- **stripe on the right** \u21d2 when a path hits that color, it must turn **clockwise** (a \u201cright turn\u201d).\n\n2) **Everything below those 6 rows = the board**  \nThere is a single **starting block** of color **8** (azure).

The core idea is that we're given an input grid, and we need to transform it based on some hidden rules. My initial focus is on the data structure: two distinct sections, a 'header' and a 'main board'. The header seems to contain the keys to the puzzle.\n\nHere\u2019s what I'm seeing:\n*   **The Big Picture:** The main action happens on the 'main board'\u2014it gets cropped to the correct output size.\n*   **The Key Ingredients:** Inside the header, I see what I'm calling \"Small Key Objects\". They seem important, with a colored vertical bar and a black block. The relative position of the bar (left or right of the black block) looks like a crucial key (pun intended!).\n*   **Deciphering the Bar Code:** I've scrutinized several examples to spot any patterns. For example, in the Test Input, the positions of the bars are as follows: Bar 1 is LEFT of the zeroes, Bar 3 is RIGHT of the zeroes, Bar 2 is LEFT of the zeroes, and Bar 4 is LEFT of the zeroes.\n\nNow, the main board has a 'seed', which is a colored block (color 8, teal). The main goal is to expand the teal block into an organized structure. After that, I need to focus on what happens to the background blocks.\n\nThe core of the transformation is about drawing lines from a teal seed. Then I figure that the header keys must tell us which sides to draw lines against. It's a lattice expansion: It's a regular grid where lines intersect or define cells or segments.\n\nThe keys indicate extra lines next to specific blocks. A \"left\" bar, which means a line should go to the left of the block. A \"right\" bar, which means a line should go to the right of the block. But where, vertically and horizontally? That's where I need to pay attention, I need to match the key with directions.\n\nI've got a new algorithm hypothesis:\n1.  **Parse Header Keys:** Identify colors and direction (left or right).\n2.  **Lattice Origins:** Use the seed 8s to define horizontal and vertical grid origins.\n3.  **Define Grid Period/Spacing:**\n    *   Find the key-relevant blocks.\n    *   For each active block, determine line target position from the key.\n    *   Figure out the seed and Block Distances.\n4.  I can draw 8-color lattice lines that may or may not overlap with the solid blocks.\n5.  There's also a \"Fill\" step with 8s (color 8).\n\nBased on those thoughts, here\u2019s how I\u2019m going to construct the output:\n1.  **Initialize:** 9 as the background, a new grid.\n2.  **Horizontal Lines:** Draw the teal lines at rows: 1-3, 7-9, 13-15, 19-21.\n3.  **Vertical Lines:** Draw teal lines at cols: 0-2, 4-6, 8-10, 12-14, 16-18, 20-22.\n4.  **Overlay**: copy non-9 pixels from the original main board.\n\nReady to code.\n\n\nThe solution involves generating a lattice of color 8 (teal) lines on the main board, while preserving the existing colored objects and the background color.\n\n**Logic:**\n1.  **Crop Header:** The input grid contains a header (rows 0-5) separated by a line of 5s. This header contains \"Key\" objects that define the lattice generation rules. The output grid corresponds to the Main Board (rows 6-29 of the input).\n2.  **Identify Lattice Parameters:**\n    *   **Line Width:** Determined by the size of the \"Seed\" object (color 8) in the Main Board. In the test input, the seed is a 3x3 block, so the lattice lines are **3 pixels wide**.\n    *   **Seed Position:** The seed is located at Output Rows 7-9 (Input Rows 13-15) and Output Cols 8-10. This anchors the grid.\n3.  **Determine Grid Spacing from Keys:**\n    *   The header contains keys consisting of a colored bar and a block of 0s. The position of the bar (Left or Right of 0s) dictates the alignment of lattice lines relative to the blocks of that color in the Main Board.\n    *   **Vertical Grid:**\n        *   **Key 4 (Left):** Refers to Block 4 (Yellow). The \"Left\" key implies a line adjacent to the Top (for horizontal blocks) or Left (for vertical blocks) side. Block 4 is horizontal (Rows 17-19, Cols 7-16). Its Left side is Col 7. A 3-pixel wide line adjacent to the left would be **Cols 4-6**.\n        *   Comparing the Seed (Cols 8-10) with this Line (Cols 4-6), the gap is 1 pixel (Col 7).\n        *   **Pattern:** 3-pixel line, 1-pixel gap.\n        *   **Vertical Lines:** Cols 0-2, 4-6, 8-10, 12-14, 16-18, 20-22.\n    *   **Horizontal Grid:**\n        *   **Key 3 (Right):** Refers to Block 3 (Green). The \"Right\" key implies a line adjacent to the Bottom or Right side. Block 3 is vertical (Rows 0-12). Its Bottom is Row 12. A 3-pixel wide line adjacent to the bottom would be **Rows 13-15**.\n        *   Comparing the Seed (Rows 7-9) with this Line (Rows 13-15), the distance is 6 rows.\n        *   **Pattern:** 3-pixel line, 3-pixel gap (Period 6).\n        *   **Horizontal Lines:** Rows 1-3, 7-9, 13-15, 19-21.\n4.  **Composition:**\n    *   Start with the Main Board background (Color 9).\n    *   Draw the calculated vertical and horizontal lines of color 8.\n    *   Overlay the original solid blocks (Colors 1, 2, 3, 4) from the Main Board on top of the lattice (or simply do not overwrite them). The original seed (8) is naturally part of the lattice.\n\n**Output Construction:**\n-   **Canvas:** 24x24 grid.\n-   **Background:** 9.\n-   **Lattice (8):** Vertical strips at cols 0-2, 4-6, 8-10, 12-14, 16-18, 20-22.

My goal is to figure out how these \"keys\" in the top header relate to the cool lattice patterns that expand in the main board. It's a spatial puzzle with some key geometric rules.\n\n**1. Data Breakdown: The Grid's Anatomy**\n\nThe input is split: header at the top and the main board below. The header has these interesting \"keys\". They are essentially vertical bars of a specific color, followed by an empty space of \"0s\" of the same height. The main board is a bigger grid filled with color blocks and a background color. My task involves understanding how the header keys dictate the expansion of a \"teal-colored 8-lattice\" on the main board. \n\n*   **Key Structure:** `[Color][0][0][0]` or `[0][0][0][Color]` is key. These keys appear in each test case.\n*   **Main Board:** Has solid colored rectangular blocks, a background color, and sometimes these \"teal 8\" seeds. These act as obstacles.\n\n**2. Deciphering the \"Lattice Game\"**\n\nMy hypothesis is that the position of the color within the key tells us something about how the lattice expands relative to the blocks on the main board. Let's look at the relationship between the keys and the lines, especially the starting seed.\n\n*   **Key Direction**: Where is the color block? Is it to the left or right of the empty space? My thought is, that the empty space in the Key, means there are 0s to the left, 0s to the right. This will map into an expansion direction. This is based on examining the test cases.\n*   **Lattice lines:** These are thin horizontal and vertical bands that appear on the board. They start from the \"seed\" (an existing 2x2/3x3 block of 8s) and from the edges of the solid color blocks.\n\n**3. Test Case Analysis**\n\nTo solve this, I will work through the provided examples and try to generalize the rules for the test input.\n\n*   **Test Case 1**\n    *   **Seed:** Starting with some existing 8s.\n    *   **Keys:** `[1|000]`, `[4|000]`, and `[2|000]`.\n    *   **Result:** A vertical lattice line to the right of Block 1 (Color 1). Vertical line to the left of block 4.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** If the bar is to the left, the lattice is to the right. The relative positions of the color block and the 0s in the key seem to correlate with the lattice lines. If the key is *[Color] [0 0 0]*, then the lattice band will go to the right of [Color] blocks.\n*   **Test Case 2:**\n    *   Keys: `[000|2]`, `[4|000]`, `[000|6]` `[3|000]`\n    *   Result: If a key is rightmost, the line is on the left.\n*   **Test Case 3:**\n    *   Keys: `[000|4]`, `[6|000]`, `[3|000]`, `[000|2]`\n    *   More of the same, which confirms the pattern of line direction and bar position.\n*   **Test Input:** The Goal. There is a seed. Key: `[1|000]` ... and what about Block 2 and 4?\n\n**4. Refining the Rule: Edges and Inner Space**\n\nThe keys dictate the blocks to spawn these grid lines. They are not direct spawners of the lines, but they mark the spot. The Key points to the \"inner space\". Now, for horizontal, or vertical blocks, the directions of lattice are at 90 degrees. Key `[C|000]` means the lattice expands toward the right.\n\n**5. Applying the \"Inner Edge\" Rule**\n\n1.  Background: Color 9.\n2.  Seed: Identify the seed in the main board. This will act as our starting point.\n3.  Seed Expansion: Expand the seed vertically and horizontally. This will construct a rectangular box in the center of the output.\n4.  Apply Keys to Solid Blocks: Based on a key like: `[Bar][0][0][0]` which means to look at blocks with their left facing sides. `000[Bar]` means right facing. For those blocks that are identified by the key, generate a\n\nTo solve the ARC task, we analyze the input to understand the transformation rules based on the provided examples.\n\n**1. Analysis of Input and Output:**\n- The input consists of a **Header** (top rows separated by a row of 5s) and a **Main Board** (the grid below).\n- The **Header** contains \"Key Objects\": 4x4 blocks consisting of a vertical bar of a specific color and a 3-column block of black (0). The relative position of the colored bar (Left or Right of the 0s) is the critical code.\n- The **Main Board** contains a background color (9 in the test case), solid rectangular blocks of colors (1, 2, 3, 4), and a \"Seed\" of color 8 (a 3x3 block in the test case).\n- The **Output** is the Main Board with a newly generated \"Lattice\" of color 8 lines. The header is removed.\n\n**2. Transformation Logic:**\n- **Preservation:** The background color and solid colored blocks from the Main Board are preserved.\n- **Lattice Generation:**\n    - The **Seed** (existing 8s) expands horizontally and vertically into bands of 8s (3 pixels wide, matching the seed size). These bands stop when they hit a solid block or the grid edge.\n    - The **Keys** in the header dictate additional lattice bands spawned from the solid blocks.\n- **Key Decoding:**\n    - A Key is composed of a colored bar and a block of 0s (space).\n    - **Rule:** The lattice band spawns adjacent to the block of the corresponding color, on the \"Inner\" side (the side facing the center of the grid / the void).\n    - Specifically, the position of the `0`s in the key relative to the colored bar indicates the direction of the lattice relative to the block's bar-like edge:\n        - `Key: [Color][0][0][0]` (Bar Left, 0s Right) $\\rightarrow$ Lattice appears to the **Right** (or Bottom for top blocks) of the block.\n        - `Key: [0][0][0][Color]` (Bar Right, 0s Left) $\\rightarrow$ Lattice appears to the **Left** (or Top for bottom blocks) of the block.\n    - In the Test Case:\n        - **Key 1 (Left Bar):** Block 1 (Left Wall) $\\rightarrow$ Spawn Vertical Lattice on **Right**.\n        - **Key 3 (Right Bar):** Block 3 (Right Wall) $\\rightarrow$ Spawn Vertical Lattice on **Left**.\n        - **Key 2 (Left Bar):** Block 2 (Top Wall) $\\rightarrow$ Spawn Horizontal Lattice on **Bottom**.\n        - **Key 4 (Left Bar):** Block 4 (Bottom Wall) $\\rightarrow$ Spawn Horizontal Lattice on **Top**.\n\n**3. Test Input Construction Details:**\n- **Grid Dimensions:** Output is 25 rows (0-24) x 24 columns (0-23). Background color is 9.\n- **Objects:**\n    - **Block 2 (Top):** Rows 1-3, Cols 0-20.\n    - **Block 3 (Right):** Rows 1-13, Cols 21-23.\n    - **Block 1 (Left):** Rows 7-16, Cols 0-2.\n    - **Block 4 (Bottom):** Rows 18-20, Cols 7-15.\n    - **Seed:** Rows 8-10, Cols 8-10 (Input relative to main board matches output).\n- **Generated Lattice Lines (Width 3):**\n    1.  **Seed Vertical:** Cols 8-10. Extends from Block 2 (Row 3) down to Block 4 (Row 18). Drawn Rows: 4-17.\n    2.  **Seed Horizontal:** Rows 8-10. Extends from Block 1 (Col 2) right to Block 3 (Col 21). Drawn Cols: 3-20.\n    3.  **From Block 1 (Right):** Vertical Band at Cols 3-5. Extends from Block 2 (Row 3) to Bottom Edge. Drawn Rows: 4-24.\n    4.  **From Block 3 (Left):** Vertical Band at Cols 18-20. Extends from Block 2 (Row 3) to Bottom Edge. Drawn Rows: 4-24.\n    5.  **From Block 2 (Bottom):** Horizontal Band at Rows 4-6. Extends from Left Edge to Block 3 (Col 21). Drawn Cols: 0-20.\n    6.  **From Block 4 (Top):** Horizontal Band at Rows 15-17. Extends from Block 1 (Col 2) to Right Edge (since Block 3 ends at Row 13).

My goal is to analyze the provided examples, deduce the underlying rule, and then apply it to the final test input to generate the correct output. I'll approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, I notice that the input grids are divided into two sections, separated by a gray horizontal line. The top section seems like a control panel or a legend of some sort. The bottom section is where the main action happens\u2014a grid with different colored regions.\n\nI've got a theory that the top section's colors are somehow key to how the bottom section is altered. I'm focusing on the idea that these top colors might represent walls or barriers, and that the other colors behave like fluids that expand and move.\n\nI carefully examined each example, trying to understand what changes between the input and output. The key insight is that the bottom grid colors are either solid barriers (walls) that do not move, or fluids, and the first item controls the rules (left = fill the container, right = fill upwards). So, the first item gives the physics rules. Then I identified the fluid, which is usually the smaller block. Finally, I will do a fill.\n\nI've tested the hypothesis on each example and determined that if the control panel color alignment (First block) is to the left, then I need to fill all non-barrier pixels from the seed (the fluid color). If the control panel is to the right, then I need to fill all non-barrier pixels, from the seed. This is my core transformation rule.\n\nNow, let's go apply the rule to the provided test input. The alignment of the first item is left, meaning to fill all.\n1. Determine the Wall colors.\n2. Determine the Fluid Color.\n3. Replace the background with the Fluid.\n\nI'm ready to tackle the test input and generate the final output. The goal is to fully fill from the fluid (8) seed into the non-barrier area of the grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Structure:** The input grids consist of a \"Control Panel\" at the top (rows 0-5) and a main \"Scene\" below (rows 6+). The output corresponds to the Scene, transformed.\n2.  **Control Panel:** The top rows contain sequences like `5, C, 0, 0, 0`. The color `C` defines a \"Wall\" material. The position of `C` within the block (Left-aligned `C,0,0,0` vs Right-aligned `0,0,0,C`) acts as a switch for the physics simulation rule.\n    *   **Example 1:** Walls are 1, 6, 4, 2. First block `1,0,0,0` is Left-aligned. Behavior: Fluid fills the entire connected \"empty\" space (Up, Down, Left, Right).\n    *   **Example 2:** Walls are 2, 4, 6, 3. First block `0,0,0,2` is Right-aligned. Behavior: Fluid (Gas) rises (Up) and spreads sideways, but does not go down.\n    *   **Example 3:** Walls are 4, 6, 3, 2. First block `0,0,0,4` is Right-aligned. Behavior: Fluid rises (Up) and spreads sideways.\n    *   **Test Input:** First block `1,0,0,0` is Left-aligned. We infer the behavior is **Full Fill** (like Example 1).\n3.  **Scene Components:**\n    *   **Walls:** Colors defined in the Control Panel act as barriers.\n    *   **Fluid:** A specific non-wall color forming a small seed/cluster (Color 8 in all examples).\n    *   **Background:** The remaining non-wall color (Color 3 in Ex 1, 1 in Ex 2, 7 in Ex 3, 9 in Test).\n4.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Identify Wall colors from the Control Panel: {1, 3, 2, 4}.\n    *   Identify Fluid (8) and Background (9) in the Scene.\n    *   Since the control is Left-aligned, perform a **Flood Fill** starting from the Fluid seeds (8), replacing all connected Background pixels (9). The fill is blocked by Walls (1, 3, 2, 4).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Walls:** 1, 3, 2, 4.\n*   **Fluid:** 8 (present as a block in the middle).\n*   **Background:** 9 (fills most of the open space).\n*   **Geometry:**\n    *   Rows 0-2 (relative to Scene): Wall `2` (top) and Wall `3` (right).\n    *   Rows 3-5: Open `9`s, Wall `3` on right.\n    *   Rows 6-12: Wall `1` on left, Wall `3` on right, `9`s in middle (containing Seed `8` at rows 7-9).\n    *   Rows 13-15: Wall `1` on left, `9`s elsewhere.\n    *   Row 16: All `9`s.\n    *   Rows 17-19: Wall `4` block in bottom-center, `9`s around it.\n    *   Rows 20-23: All `9`s.\n*   **Simulation:** The Fluid `8` starts at the seed and expands to fill all connected `9`s. Since the \"room\" is connected (fluid can flow around the floating Wall `4`, and past the partial walls `1` and `3`), all `9`s in the grid will be converted to `8`. The Walls `1, 2, 3, 4` remain unchanged.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nWe reconstruct the grid replacing 9s with 8s.\n\n*   **Rows 0-2:** `2` x 21, `3` x 3.\n*   **Rows 3-5:** `8` x 21, `3` x 3.\n*   **Rows 6-12:** `1` x 3, `8` x 18, `3` x 3.\n*   **Rows 13-15:** `1` x 3, `8` x 21.\n*   **Row 16:** `8` x 24.\n*   **Rows 17-19:** `8` x 7, `4` x 9, `8` x 8.\n*   **Rows 20-23:** `8` x 24.\n\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 12>\n<CANDIDATE 13>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 24x24\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n999999888888999999888333\n999999888888999999888333\n999999888888999999888333\n111999888888999999888333\n111999888888999999888333\n111999888888999999888333\n111999888888999999888333\n111999888888999999888333\n111999888888999999888333\n111999888888999999888333\n111999888888999999888333\n111999888888999999888333\n111999888888999999888333\n999999888888999999888888\n999999844444444499888888\n999999844444444499888888\n999999844444444499888888\n999999888888999999888888\n999999888888999999888888\n999999888888999999888888\n999999888888999999888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_5_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling an ARC problem. The input seems to be a grid with a control panel and a main grid. My job is to transform the main grid based on instructions from the control panel.  The control panel has \"switches\" or \"indicators\" which I believe control changes in the main grid's color blocks.  I need to figure out the rule.  It looks like there is a horizontal gray line that separates the two sections.\n\n**Input Analysis and Pattern Recognition:**\n\nI'll dive into the input's structure, focusing on both the control panel and the main grid, particularly color patterns. I'm noting the repeating pattern of colors separated by black spaces. The control panel has vertical stripes of colors. I am examining Example 1's Control panel which seems to contain vertical blocks of information. It looks like the structure goes: `5, color, 0,0,0, 5` with 5's acting as separators and this pattern repeats across the row. The input size is 24 width. The grid content has a combination of colored regions of rectangular shape. Example 1's \"bottom section\" color is a large green background with a blue rectangle on left, a teal rectangle in center, a yellow rectangle to the right and a red rectangle at the bottom. The output has modifications compared to the input grid's bottom section. The transformation happens to the bottom section. I need to figure out the relationship between control panel and changes to main grid.\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation and Iterative Refinement:**\n\nI am carefully analyzing the relationship between the control panel and the resulting output grid. I notice in Example 1, a Teal rectangle expands significantly from Input to Output.  I'm tracking the transformation in Example 1 to analyze. It appears the blue, yellow, and red regions remain the same, but Teal 8 expands. I re-read the example 1 output carefully. There's two 8 pixel blocks in output Row 0. The output height is smaller than input. So the top control panel is removed in the output. Based on this example, it seems the region associated with the 'missing' color expands.\n\nI'm checking out Example 2's structure. Here, Example 2 has color 2 on left, 4 on the right, and 8 in the middle. The color 8 expands again. So 8 is the key. The expanded color is not present in the control panel. In Example 2, 8 (Teal) also expands. I realize the control panel has an association to the regions. In Example 3, Color 8 (Teal) expands. The input's color block has to match the control's color blocks.\n\n**Pattern Generalization and Rule Extraction:**\n\nI understand the core principle. The color absent in the control panel's \"switches\" is the \"active\" fluid. This \"active\" fluid region always expands into \"empty\" space. The 4 blocks, each defines a color and an implicit direction or \"action\" for a region in the grid. In Example 1, they were all positioned left. In Example 2 the values changed.  I have identified:  There are 4 blocks. There are 4 colors. It seems that there are 4 directions in which the color can be placed: left, right, up, down.  \n\n**Edge Case Analysis and Robustness Testing:**\n\nExample 1 is where everything is at the left. In Ex 2, Red is at right, Yellow is at left, Pink is at right, Green is at left. My main hypothesis: The position of the color in the block dictates the expansion direction of that color.  I realize there are only two positions in these rules, 0 or 3. I analyze these two conditions to decide about the expansion of color 8. In example 1, the 8 expanded up from the center, the position of 6 in control panel corresponds to position of color 8 and it has expanded. In example 2 I see it expanding up and horizontally. I see 2 has slot 4 and expands right while 4 has slot 1 which expands left.\nI am calling slot 0 and 3 Left and Right. But the expansion direction is not exactly like that. I am revisiting the control panel meaning, maybe it defines boundaries and maybe it defines forces for gravity. My hypothesis is that each slot position will relate to an expansion, and all these slot positions might be active at the same time. The test input has four blocks of 4 colors. The expansion direction may have a lot to do with direction.  This structure is probably the control panel.\n\n**Rule Formalization and Algorithm Design:**\n\nI hypothesize the Color can define the expansion in the output and that that position defines the expansion in the control panel. I think the position (\n\nThe input grids contain a \"control panel\" in the top 6 rows and a \"bottom section\" containing various colored regions. The task involves a transformation of the bottom section governed by the switches in the control panel.\n\n**Analysis of the Control Panel:**\nThe control panel is divided into 4 blocks (columns 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22), corresponding to 4 vertical strips of the grid (0-5, 6-11, 12-17, 18-23). Each block contains a specific color at a specific \"slot\" (position 0 or 3 within the block), indicating a switch setting.\nThe colors in the control panel determine whether the corresponding vertical strip is \"Active\" or \"Inactive\". An Active strip fills its empty space (background color) with a \"fluid\" color.\n\n**Logic derived from examples:**\n1.  **Fluid Color:** The color that appears in the grid but is *not* in the control panel is the fluid. In all examples and the test case, this color is **8 (Teal)**.\n2.  **Strip Activation Rules:**\n    *   **Yellow (4):** Always Active (regardless of slot).\n    *   **Blue (1):** Always Inactive.\n    *   **Green (3):** Inactive (observed at Slot 0). Assuming Inactive at Slot 3 unless it contains the Source.\n    *   **Red (2):** Active if Slot 3 (Right), Inactive if Slot 0 (Left).\n    *   **Pink (6):** Active if Slot 0 (Left), Inactive if Slot 3 (Right).\n3.  **Source Rule:** The strip containing the original source of the fluid (Color 8) is **Always Active**, overriding any Inactive status from the control panel.\n4.  **Filling Process:** In every Active strip, all background pixels (color 9 in the test case) are replaced by the fluid color (8). Existing objects (colors other than background or fluid) act as barriers and remain unchanged.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Strip 1 (Cols 0-5):** Control is **Blue (1)** at Slot 0 (Left). Rule: **Inactive**.\n*   **Strip 2 (Cols 6-11):** Control is **Green (3)** at Slot 3 (Right). Contains the Source (8). Rule: **Active** (Source Rule).\n*   **Strip 3 (Cols 12-17):** Control is **Red (2)** at Slot 0 (Left). Rule: **Inactive**.\n*   **Strip 4 (Cols 18-23):** Control is **Yellow (4)** at Slot 0 (Left). Rule: **Active**.\n\n**Transformation:**\n*   **Strip 1:** No change. (Retains Red, Blue, Background 9).\n*   **Strip 2:** Active. Background 9s become 8s. Existing objects (Red, Source 8, Yellow 4) are preserved.\n*   **Strip 3:** No change. (Retains Red, Yellow, Background 9).\n*   **Strip 4:** Active. Background 9s become 8s. Existing objects (Red, Green) are preserved.\n\noutput:\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 13>\n<CANDIDATE 14>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 24x24\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n999999998888888888888333\n999999998889999999998333\n999999998889999999998333\n111999998889999999998333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111899998889999999999333\n111899998889999999999333\n111899998889999999999333\n111899998889999999999999\n111899998889999999999999\n111899998889999999999999\n999888888888888888888888\n999999944444444499999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\nLooking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Legend Section (Rows 0-5)**: Contains color indicators showing which direction lines extend from rectangles.

At each rectangle's edge, draw perpendicular 8-lines:\n   - Left edge vertical extends down to the bottom horizontal\n   - Right edge vertical extends up from grid top to main horizontal\n   - Top horizontal extends left from 8's column to grid left\n   - Bottom horizontal extends from left edge to grid right (when left rectangle doesn't exist at that level)\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n- Main grid: 24\u00d724 (rows 6-29 of input)\n- Red (2): rows 0-2, cols 0-20 (TOP)\n- Green (3): rows 0-12, cols 21-23 (RIGHT)\n- Blue (1): rows 6-15, cols 0-2 (LEFT)\n- Yellow (4): rows 17-19, cols 7-15 (BOTTOM)\n- 8 marker: rows 7-9, cols 8-10 (3\u00d73, so lines are 3 cells wide)\n\nDrawing the 8-line structure:\n- Main horizontal: rows 7-9, cols 3-20\n- Main vertical: cols 8-10, rows 3-16\n- Top horizontal: rows 3-5, cols 0-10\n- Bottom horizontal: rows 14-16 (extending to col 23 at row 16 where blue ends)\n- Left edge vertical: cols 3-5, rows 3-16\n- Right edge vertical: cols 18-20, rows 0-9 (overlapped by red at rows 0-2)\n\n```\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 17>\n<CANDIDATE 18>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 20x24\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n999999998889999999999333\n999999998889999999999333\n999999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111888888888889998889333\n111888888888889998889333\n111888888888889998889333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n999999998889999999999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999944444444499999999\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n**My strategy for solving this ARC task boils down to identifying the source, targets, and connection rules.**\n\n1.  **Understand the Inputs:** I start by meticulously analyzing the provided example grids, focusing on the input and corresponding output. I recognize the initial pattern as a grid with some additional patterns. The header contains essential information.\n\n2.  **Uncover the Core Logic:**  I've found that the core of the transformation centers around a \"source\" block (often cyan/teal, color 8) and a set of \"target\" shapes of different colors. The input's size is the grid size. The output removes the header. The output's size is equal to the main canvas.\n\n3.  **Establish Connections:** Lines start from the source and connect to targets in four directions (up, down, left, and right) based on where the source and target patterns overlap in the x or y axis.\n    *   If they overlap in the Y-axis (meaning the patterns are horizontally aligned), then there is a vertical line.\n    *   If they overlap in the X-axis (meaning the patterns are vertically aligned), then there is a horizontal line.\n\n4.  **Decipher the Header:** The header provides crucial data to determine the style of the line connections (solid or dashed). Each \"connection\" block (4 numbers) maps to a pattern. An index value of `0` in the header means a solid connection, and `3` denotes a dashed connection (two pixels on, two pixels off).\n\n5.  **Dashed Line Implementation:** If the connection is dashed, the line pattern has to scale depending on the source size.\n\n6.  **Handle Perpendicular Extensions (Edge Case):** I had a harder time understanding why there's a vertical or horizontal expansion line. It seems that this occurs when targets are not aligned. It happens when there is an unaligned horizontal expansion (to a target in the horizontal axis, but not in the vertical axis), but not in the reversed case. It's safe to assume that extra lines do not exist in the basic case.\n\n7.  **Generate the Output:** Based on the above observations, the output is generated as a CSV grid of width 24 and height 20. The key aspect is drawing the lines of the correct color according to the connections.\n\n8.  **Final Verification:** I always double-check my logic against the examples to ensure it works in all scenarios and that the code meets all specifications.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid by removing the header section and generating a pattern of lines on the main canvas. The \"source\" of these lines is the cyan (teal, color 8) block. The lines extend from this source to connect with other colored rectangles in the grid or the edges of the canvas. The specific style of the connection (solid vs. dashed) is determined by a code in the header section.\n\n**Reasoning Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Workspace:** The top 6 rows (0-5) are a header/legend and should be removed. The output grid corresponds to rows 6-25 of the input (the main canvas).\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:** In the test input's main canvas, there is a 3x3 block of cyan (8) pixels at rows 7-9 (relative to the canvas top) and columns 8-10. This is the source from which lines will extend.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Header for Rules:** The header consists of repeating blocks of 4 numbers. Each block corresponds to a color present in the grid. The position of the color number within its 4-number block dictates the line style:\n    *   **Index 0 (e.g., `1,0,0,0`):** Solid connection. The line fills all pixels between the source and the target.\n    *   **Index 3 (e.g., `0,0,0,3`):** Dashed connection. The line is drawn with a pattern of gaps.\n    *   **Mapping for Test Input:**\n        *   Blue (1): `1,0,0,0` -> **Solid**.\n        *   Green (3): `0,0,0,3` -> **Dashed**.\n        *   Red (2): `2,0,0,0` -> **Solid**.\n        *   Yellow (4): `4,0,0,0` -> **Solid**.\n\n4.  **Determine Geometry and Connections:**\n    *   **Source:** Rows 7-9, Cols 8-10 (3x3).\n    *   **Blue (Left):** Solid connection. The blue strip is to the left. A solid horizontal line of color 8 connects the source to the blue strip.\n    *   **Green (Right):** Dashed connection. The green strip is to the right. A dashed horizontal line connects the source to the green strip. Based on the source size (3x3), the dash pattern is \"3 pixels fill, 3 pixels gap\".\n    *   **Red (Top):** Solid connection. The red rectangle is above. A solid vertical line connects the source up to the red rectangle.\n    *   **Yellow (Bottom):** Solid connection. The yellow rectangle is below. A solid vertical line connects the source down to the yellow rectangle.\n\n5.  **Construct the Output Grid:**\n    *   Start with the canvas background (color 9) and existing shapes (Blue, Red, Green, Yellow).\n    *   **Draw Horizontal Lines (Rows 7-9):**\n        *   Left (Solid): Fill cols 3-7 with 8.\n        *   Right (Dashed): Start from col 11. Fill 11-13, Skip 14-16, Fill 17-19, Skip 20.\n    *   **Draw Vertical Lines (Cols 8-10):**\n        *   Up (Solid): Fill rows 3-6 with 8 (connecting Source at row 7 to Red at row 2).\n        *   Down (Solid): Fill rows 10-16 with 8 (connecting Source at row 9 to Yellow at row 17).\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nThe resulting grid is 20 rows high and 24 columns wide, containing the preserved shapes and the new cyan connection structure.\n\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 18>\n<CANDIDATE 19>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 48x24\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n888888888888888888888333\n888888888888888888888333\n888888888888888888888333\n111999998889999999999333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n888888888888888888888888\n999999944444444499999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n888888888888888888888333\n888888888888888888888333\n888888888888888888888333\n111999998889999999999333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n888888888888888888888888\n999999944444444499999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n**Thought Process: Solving an ARC Task with Palette-Based Image Manipulation**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I need to figure out how to transform an image based on examples and a test case. The input always has a \"palette\" at the top that seems to give some instructions. My goal is to use that to expand a cyan block into lines, but there are constraints based on the colored regions in the main image.\n\nFirst, I looked at the structure. There's a palette, then a main image. The palette has repeating patterns, and I think it might be encoding some relationships between the colors. The main image has solid color rectangles, and a cyan block is a sort of seed. The output should be the same size, but the cyan lines \"grow\" from the seed, and they also seem to form some kind of maze or divider.\n\nI read the hints. I need to crop the palette, so my main focus is on the main image. The cyan block is the starting point, and I have to use cyan color 8 for expansion lines. The existing rectangles define the boundaries. The new cyan structure has to be a maze partitioning the background.\n\nI studied the examples. Example 1 has a blue left rectangle, a yellow right, and a red bottom. I realized the cyan lines form a bounding box around the other colors. After looking closely at the outputs and the palette, I came up with an idea. The palette might be encoding the directions.\n\nLooking at the palette structure, I assumed it to be directional mapping based on the order of colors in the palette. It seems the palette has directions encoded into the color list. The index of the values, also, seems to control the branching: 0 = Branch, 3 = No Branch. For Ex 1, if the block index is 0, the direction in that same order is Left, Up, Right, Down. I then assumed I can create a main cross from the seed, then add branches at the limits based on the branch logic.\n\nWith this in mind, I then tried to go through the Test Input to construct the answer from the ground up, based on my understanding. It contains red, yellow, blue, and green rectangles. Then I tried to apply the branching logic to the Test Input.\n\nAfter reviewing, it seems my algorithm works to expand the cyan block horizontally and vertically and branch out at the top/bottom as needed. It involves using the palette to determine the branching and creating cyan horizontal and vertical extensions based on the existing rectangles.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, I analyzed the structure of the input and the transformation logic demonstrated in the examples.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Input:**\n*   **Header/Palette:** The top 6 rows (0-5) form a repeating \"palette\" pattern separated by a row of grey (5) pixels. This palette encodes instructions for how the Cyan (8) structure should connect to other colored regions.\n*   **Main Canvas:** Rows 6 and below contain the actual puzzle layout. This consists of a background color (often 9 or 3), large rectangular \"obstacle\" regions of various colors, and a central \"seed\" block of Cyan (8) pixels.\n*   **Palette Decoding:** The palette consists of four groups of 4 values (columns between the 5s). Each group corresponds to a cardinal direction (order: Up, Down, Left, Right or similar). Crucially, the **index** of the non-zero color within its 4-value block determines the connection behavior:\n    *   **Index 0 (e.g., `1,0,0,0`):** Indicates a **Branching/Wide Connection**. When the cyan line connects to a rectangle in this direction (or determines the direction is valid), it creates a wide \"plate\" or fill perpendicular to the connection line, extending to the nearest side obstacles.\n    *   **Index 3 (e.g., `0,0,0,3`):** Indicates a **Simple/Narrow Connection**. The connection is just a straight line extending from the seed to the target.\n*   **Test Input Palette:** `1,0,0,0`, `3,0,0,3`, `2,0,0,0`, `4,0,0,0`.\n    *   `1` (Blue) at Index 0.\n    *   `3` (Green) at Index 3.\n    *   `2` (Red) at Index 0.\n    *   `4` (Yellow) at Index 0.\n    *   Mapping to Canvas:\n        *   Red is **Up**. Index 0 implies **Branch**.\n        *   Yellow is **Down**. Index 0 implies **Branch**.\n        *   Blue is **Left**. Index 0. (Horizontal main axis).\n        *   Green is **Right**. Index 3. (Horizontal main axis).\n\n**2. Transformation Logic:**\nThe goal is to grow the Cyan (8) seed into a connected network.\n1.  **Main Cross:**\n    *   **Horizontal:** Extend the rows of the seed (Rows 7-9 relative to canvas start) to the left and right until hitting an obstacle or edge.\n        *   Left: Hits Blue rectangle (Cols 0-2). Fill starts at Col 3.\n        *   Right: Hits Green rectangle (Cols 21-23). Fill ends at Col 20.\n    *   **Vertical:** Extend the columns of the seed (Cols 8-10) up and down until hitting an obstacle.\n        *   Up: Hits Red rectangle (Rows 0-2). Fill starts at Row 3.\n        *   Down: Hits Yellow rectangle (Rows 17-19). Fill ends at Row 16.\n2.  **Branches (Plates):**\n    *   **Top Branch (Up):** Because Red corresponds to Index 0, we create a branch adjacent to it.\n        *   Location: Rows 3-5 (Gap between Red and the main Blue/Green rects).\n        *   Width: Extend left and right until hitting obstacles.\n        *   Left: No Blue rect at these rows (starts Row 6). Extend to Edge (Col 0).\n        *   Right: Green rect exists (Cols 21-23).

**Background color** = the most common color on the main canvas.\n   - **Cyan seed block** = the only small block of color `8`.  \n     Its **bounding box** gives the brush size `(h \u00d7 w)`; in the test it is a **3\u00d73** block.\n\n3. **Treat the cyan block as a sliding \u201cstamp/brush\u201d**\n   - The brush can slide **orthogonally** (up/down/left/right) over **background** cells.\n   - It **cannot overlap** any non-background, non-cyan cells (the large rectangles); those rectangles are preserved.\n   - When the brush slides, **every background cell covered anywhere along the slide** is recolored to cyan (`8`).  \n     (So the painted path has the same thickness as the seed block.)\n\n4. **Which slides are performed (this generates the divider network)**\n   - From the seed position, slide the brush **left, right, up, and down** (a thick \u201ccross\u201d).\n   - From the **right end** of that horizontal slide, also slide **up**.\n   - From the **left end** of that horizontal slide:\n     -

I've broken down the pattern based on the examples and I think I've got it. Here's the gist of what's going on:\n\n*   **The Big Picture:** We're given a bunch of input grids and we have to spit out a transformed grid. The transformation seems to focus on an area below a header section. It's like the header tells us what to do with the stuff below it.\n\n*   **Header Decoding:** The header is key. It's got these black boxes with colored bars next to them. The colors in the bars are the important bit. They represent the *targets* of our transformation. I initially thought the position of the bar (left or right) mattered for direction, but that's a dead end. Instead, I believe the *colors themselves* are the crucial pieces.\n\n*   **Finding the Hub:** There's always this area within the grid that is a consistent color (light blue) and kind of stands out. This is the **hub**. It's the central point of the transformation.\n\n*   **The \"Connecting the Dots\" Transformation:** The goal is to draw straight paths from the hub to colored blocks in the main grid section. Straight paths are drawn when an overlap exists (hub row overlaps with target row - horizontal path; hub column overlaps with target column - vertical path). If no overlap, a single dogleg is drawn (primary direction, then a turn). I was initially confused by the \"left/right\" bar and thought it decided \"dogleg or straight\", but it's really the *geometry* of the blocks that decides whether the path is straight or has to jog.\n\n*   **The Header's True Purpose:** The colors in the header boxes act as a sort of list or task list. They tell me which colored blocks in the main area I *must* connect to the hub. If a color is in the header, then a path must connect the hub and the corresponding colored block within the body of the grid. If a color is not present in the body, it is ignored (this explains some pink blocks).\n\n*   **Paths and Obstacles:** The paths are straight or dog-leg. The path fills the space, effectively overwriting background pixels.\n\n*   **Applying the Rules to the Test Input:** So, for the given test input, I need to:\n    1.  Figure out the relevant part of the grid (excluding the header).\n    2.  Find the hub (easy, it's the light blue block).\n    3.  Find all of the target blocks in the grid.\n    4.  Draw paths of the \"hub color\" (light blue) from the hub to the location of the target blocks. Draw paths in the correct horizontal and vertical directions. Overlap is handled by choosing a straight line, otherwise a simple dogleg is drawn.\n\nI've got this. I am now confident that my plan will generate the requested output.\n\n\nThe goal of this task is to generate an output grid based on the provided input grid, following the transformation logic inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Structure of Input**:\n    *   **Header (Rows 0-4)**: Defines the \"targets\" for the transformation. It contains black boxes with colored bars. The colors of these bars represent the specific colored blocks in the main grid that need to be connected.\n    *   **Separator (Row 5)**: A grey line separates the header from the body.\n    *   **Body (Row 6 onwards)**: The main play area containing a \"Hub\" (a block of color 8, usually Light Blue) and several other colored blocks on a background.\n\n2.  **The Transformation**:\n    *   **Grid Resizing**: The output grid consists only of the transformed \"Body\" area. The top 6 rows (Header + Separator) are removed.\n    *   **Connecting Targets**: The core task is to draw lines connecting the central **Hub (Color 8)** to the specific **Target Blocks** identified in the header.\n    *   **Path Properties**:\n        *   **Color**: The paths are drawn using the Hub's color (8).\n        *   **Geometry**: The paths are straight lines (horizontal or vertical) extending from the Hub.\n        *   **Direction**: The direction is determined by the relative position of the Target Block to the Hub (North, South, East, or West).\n        *   **Width/Height**: The path maintains the thickness of the Hub. If the Hub is 3x3, the vertical path is 3 columns wide, and the horizontal path is 3 rows high.\n        *   **Connectivity**: The path extends from the Hub until it touches the Target Block. It overwrites the background but does *not* overwrite the Target Block itself.\n    *   **Targets**: In the test input, the header contains bars of colors **Blue (1)**, **Green (3)**, **Red (2)**, and **Yellow (4)**. Therefore, we must connect the Hub to the blocks of these four colors.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Grid Dimensions**: Input is 30x24.

The problem involves transforming large grids with some interesting structure \u2013 a header at the top and a main grid with colored blocks. My approach is to treat the header as a sort of wiring diagram and the main grid as the components we need to connect.\n\nHere's my thinking process:\n\n1.  **Grid Setup:** The grid size varies, but there's a clear header separated by a gray line (color 5). The main grid has a background color, which in the examples is green (3).\n\n2.  **The Header is Key:** Each header has boxes, each containing a color bar (left or right side). These seem to define *which* objects in the main grid get linked, and *which direction* to make the connection. I've noticed the numbers inside the black header boxes don't seem to be important to the final solution.\n\n3.  **Example 1 Insights:** In the first example, the header colors are blue, magenta, yellow, and red. The output shows a light blue \"node\" (color 8) that links objects of these colors to one another. Each header \"card\" corresponds to the block of that color on the main grid, and the wire goes in the right direction. The mapping is: Blue (Left), Magenta(Top), Yellow(Right), Red (Bottom).\n\n4.  **Header Color = Object:** The header colors directly tell me which object to connect in the output. The bar's position *inside* the header box seems to map to a direction from the \"node\".\n\n5.  **Bar Position Matters:** \"Left Bar\" could indicate that direction. In the initial example the connection is to the wall if an object of the right color isn't there, and otherwise connects to the object in the correct direction.\n\n6.  **Bar Mapping:** Initially, I assumed the 4 header boxes map to North, East, South, and West. This is consistent with Example 1. Example 2 contradicts this. The bar position seems to affect the mapping, and it varies between the examples.\n\n7.  **Object's Location Trumps Direction:** After reviewing all three examples, I think the *location* of the object is the key, and it does not use a fixed mapping. The header color indicates the target object. A bar at the left side of the header box implies the target object is on the left, etc. The node creates connections in the 4 directions as required. If there is no object in that direction, go to the edge.\n\n8.  **Output Grid Creation:** The output is a modified version of the main grid, but *minus* the last row.\n    \n9.  **Test Input Application:** Now, to apply this understanding to the test case. I will extract the main grid from rows 6-28. I then get the colors from the header. This header tells me to connect Blue to Left, Green to Right, Red to Up, Yellow to Down, from a 3x3 node in the center.\n\n10. **Path Construction:** I locate the target blocks in the grid. Then, I will draw paths (color 8, width 3) from the center to those blocks in those directions. If a block is missing, I draw the path to the wall in the corresponding direction.\n\n11. **Final Output:** The final output is just the modified main grid. I\u2019m confident this strategy will solve the task!\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we need to understand the relationship between the \"header\" (the top section of the grid) and the \"main grid\" (the rest of the grid).\n\n**Observations:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:**\n    *   Each input grid has a header in rows 0-5, separated from the main grid by a grey line (color 5) or implicit boundary.\n    *   The header contains 4 \"boxes\" or slots. Each box displays a specific color and a bar position (left or right).\n    *   The main grid contains a central \"node\" of light blue (color 8) and several rectangular blocks of other colors.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   The goal is to connect the central light blue node (color 8) to specific target objects using paths of color 8.\n    *   The **Header** specifies the **Target Colors** that need to be connected.\n    *   The **Grid Layout** determines the **Direction** of the connection.\n        *   We scan the main grid to find the location of the blocks corresponding to the colors in the header.\n        *   If a target color block is on the **Left** relative to the center, we draw a path to the **Left**.\n        *   If it's on the **Right**, we draw a path to the **Right**.\n        *   If it's on the **Top**, we draw a path to the **Up**.\n        *   If it's on the **Bottom**, we draw a path to the **Down**.\n    *   If a specified color is missing from the grid (like Magenta in Example 1), the path is drawn in the remaining available direction (towards the wall).\n    *   The header contains exactly 4 slots, and there are exactly 4 cardinal directions (Up, Down, Left, Right) from the center. Each slot maps to one direction based on the object's position.\n\n3.  **Details for Path Drawing:**\n    *   The path color is 8 (Light Blue).\n    *   The path width matches the width of the central node (2-wide in examples, 3-wide in the test case).\n    *   The path starts from the center and extends until it hits the target object or the grid boundary.\n    *   The output grid consists of the main grid (rows 6 and below) with the header removed. Additionally, the very last row of the input seems to be dropped in the examples (likely serving as a footer or padding).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Header:**\n    *   The header contains 4 boxes with colors: **Blue (1)**, **Green (3)**, **Red (2)**, **Yellow (4)**.\n    *   We need to connect the center to these 4 colors.\n\n2.  **Analyze Main Grid (Rows 6-29):**\n    *   **Center:** A 3x3 block of 8s is located at Rows 13-15 (relative to the full grid), Columns 8-10.\n    *   **Target Locations:**\n        *   **Blue (1):** Located on the **Left** edge (Cols 0-2, Rows 13-21). -> **Direction: Left**.\n        *   **Green (3):** Located on the **Right** edge (Cols 21-23, Rows 6-18). -> **Direction: Right**.\n        *   **Red (2):** Located at the **Top** (Rows 6-8, Cols 0-20). -> **Direction: Up**.\n        *   **Yellow (4):** Located at the **Bottom** area (Rows 23-25, Cols 7-15). -> **Direction: Down**.\n\n3.  **Construct Paths:**\n    *   **Left Path:** From Center (Cols 8-10) to Blue (Col 2). Draw 8s in Rows 13-15, Columns 3-7.\n    *   **Right Path:** From Center (Cols 8-10) to Green (Col 21).

<ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Alright, let's break down this ARC problem. I'm faced with deciphering a pattern across three examples and a test case, all of which involve a grid where color is crucial.**\n\nMy initial thoughts are to understand the layout. I see a clear structure: a header with instructions, and a map/maze below. The header seems to define rules for how color 8 (teal, the \"fluid\") behaves.  I'm focusing on how the non-source colors (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) in the header influence this fluid, the direction or displacement, or how they interact.\n\nI see that the Header has distinct regions defined for different colors. I begin by analyzing each sample and identify the relationship between the colors and directions defined in the header, and how they interact with where color 8 is.  \n\nI have to look for any correlation between the position of non-zero numbers in each Header and the directions the \"fluid\" 8 travels. It looks like the Header has direction and that direction impacts the behavior of 8s (the \"wind\"). It\u2019s like a conveyor belt, or maybe the regions create a \"gravity\" that pulls 8s.\n\nThe map also matters. The header is how the non-source colors transform color 8.  I believe the 8s are being moved by the header rule.   In some cases, the direction seems to be a consistent shift (left or right, above/below the source cells), while in others, there's a more local effect.\n\nI realized that The source color (8s) has a fixed location in each example and has a specific relationship between source rows and the non-source areas.  I think the source's behavior depends on its relative position to the header rules.  \n\nThe problem has both fill and clone behavior. I have to create an algorithm for how to decide between fill and clone.\n\nAfter going back and forth, I am now confident about the following:\n\n*   **Source Propagation:** Teal 8s exist at a Source position\n*   **Horizontal Influence**: I have rules for where 8s go:\n    *   **Inside/Overlapping Region:** If direction is Right, fill to right edge. If Left, fill to left edge.\n    *   **Remote Region (Clone):** If \"downwind\" of source (wind from region to source), clone near region. If \"upwind\" - No clone.\n* **Global Wind Direction**: A global wind flips direction below the Source rows.\n\nMy prediction is to create these rules for each test. For each row: Identify the regions. Does it overlap? Apply those rules and generate the outcome. Then I'll test the solution.\n\n\nThe transformation depends on the interaction between \"colored regions\" defined in the grid and a set of \"wind directions\" defined in the header rows (rows 1-4). A source of teal color (8) exists in the grid (defined by the `8`s in the input). The regions \"blow\" the teal color based on their assigned direction, creating clones or filling spaces.\n\n**Rules:**\n1.  **Header Parsing:**\n    *   The top section (between grey `5` lines) contains 4 blocks, each representing a rule for a specific color.\n    *   The position of the non-zero color within the block `0,0,0,0` determines the direction.\n    *   Mapping:\n        *   Position 0 (e.g., `1,0,0,0`): **Left**.\n        *   Position 3 (e.g., `0,0,0,1`): **Right**.\n\n2.  **Source Identification:**\n    *   Identify the columns containing the teal `8`s in the input. These are the **Source Columns**.\n\n3.  **Wind Direction Logic:**\n    *   The grid is divided vertically relative to the Source Rows (rows containing the original `8`s).\n    *   **Above Source Rows:** Regions respect the directions defined in the header.\n    *   **Below Source Rows:** Regions **invert** their directions (Left becomes Right, Right becomes Left).\n    *   **Source Rows:** Directions act to \"Pull\" or \"Fill\" if conditions are met (often acting as barriers or filling space between opposed winds).\n\n4.  **Effect on Teal (8s):**\n    *   **Cloning (Remote Interaction):** If a region's active wind direction blows *towards* the Source Columns (i.e., Region is on the Right and blowing Left, or Region is on the Left and blowing Right), it creates a copy of the Source 8s adjacent to the region on the windward side.\n    *   **Filling (Inside/Overlapping Interaction):** If the Source Columns are *inside* or *overlapping* a region, the wind \"smears\" the 8s in the active direction to the edge of the grid (or until hitting another region).\n    *   **Default:** The Source 8s always remain in their original columns.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Header:**\n    *   Block 1: `1,0,0,0` -> **Color 1 is Left**.\n    *   Block 2: `0,0,0,3` -> **Color 3 is Right**.\n    *   Block 3: `2,0,0,0` -> **Color 2 is Left**.\n    *   Block 4: `4,0,0,0` -> **Color 4 is Left**.\n*   **Source:** `8`s are at columns 8, 9, 10 in rows 13-15.\n*   **Transformation by Row Segments:**\n    *   **Rows 6-8 (Above Source):**\n        *   Contains Region 2 (cols 0-20) and Region 3 (cols 21-23).\n        *   **Region 2 (Left):** Source (8-10) is inside. Fill Left -> Fills columns **0-10**.\n        *   **Region 3 (Right):** Blows away from source. No effect.\n        *   *Result:* 8s in cols 0-10.\n    *   **Rows 9-11 (Above Source):**\n        *   Contains Region 9 (BG) and Region 3 (cols 21-23).\n        *   **Region 3 (Right):** Blows away from source. No effect.\n        *   *Result:* 8s in cols 8-10 (Source only).\n    *   **Rows 12 (Above Source):**\n        *   Contains Region 1 (0-2) and Region 3 (21-23).\n        *   **Region 1 (Left):** Blows away from source.\n        *   **Region 3 (Right):** Blows away from source.\n        *   *Result:* 8s in cols 8-10.\n    *   **Rows 13-15 (Source Rows):**\n        *   Contains Region 1 (0-2) and Region 3 (21-23).\n        *   Both blow away (Left/Right). No filling \"suction\" generated in this configuration (unlike Ex 2).\n        *   *Result:* 8s in cols 8-10.\n    *   **Rows 16-21 (Below Source -> Invert Directions):**\n        *   Contains Region 1 (0-2) and Region 3 (21-23).\n        *   **Region 1 (Left -> Right):** Blows towards Source (from 2 to 8). Creates **Clone** adjacent to Region 1 (cols 3, 4, 5).\n        *   **Region 3 (Right -> Left):** Blows towards Source (from 21 to 8). Creates **Clone** adjacent to Region 3 (cols 18, 19, 20).\n        *   *Result:* 8s in cols 3-5, 8-10, 18-20.\n    *   **Row 22 (Below Source):**\n        *   Only Region 9. No active regions.\n        *   *Result:* 8s in cols 8-10.\n    *   **Rows 23-25 (Below Source -> Invert Directions):**\n        *   Contains Region 4 (cols 7-15).\n        *   **Region 4 (Left -> Right):** Source (8-10) is inside. Fill Right -> Fills columns **8-23** (to right edge).\n        *   *Result:* 8s in cols 8-23.\n\noutput:\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"1\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_4_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**The Grand ARC Task Unveiling**\n\nOkay, so I'm staring down this ARC task, and it's time to break it down. My initial assessment? It's all about geometric transformation within a grid. Think of it like a puzzle with rules baked in.\n\n**Initial Impressions:**\n\n*   **Grid Size:** They're big, around 25x24 or 30x25.\n*   **Sections:** Grids are divided into distinct regions.\n*   **The Key:** There's this 6-row \"key\" section at the top, separated by a horizontal gray line, which seems to be the instruction manual.\n\n**The Key Decoded (Hopefully):**\n\n*   **Patterns:** It seems the key translates color into action and direction.\n*   **Example Analysis:** Each color acts as \"wall\" for the expanding color, and the patterns inside those horizontal spans are what direct the action.\n*   **Wall Logic:** If a shape is present on the left of 4x4, it means left movement is restricted.\n*   **Flood Fill / Region Growing:** The unique color (let's call it the \"expander\") \"fills\" the space, but it stops when it encounters a different color (the \"walls\").\n*   **Key Insight:** Key colors are walls and direct the expansion.\n\n**Expanding Region's Secrets (The \"Expander\"):**\n\n*   **The Source:** Color 8 is often the one expanding and is not present in the key.\n*   **Rules:** The key's rules guide the expansion, with all 8s bounded by all walls.\n*   **No Leakage (Or So I Thought):** I'm trying to figure out why 8s stop at their walls.\n*   **Geometry / Region Expansion:** The bounding box, or perhaps the convex hull, determines the extent of the 8s.\n*   **It's all about region:** The key shows a \"bounding box\".\n*   **Coordinate Check and Bounding Box:** I should use wall location to define fill limits.\n*   **Intersection of half planes**: Walls represent boundaries of a polygon. 8s can be present within this defined area.\n\n**Putting It All Together (The Solution):**\n\n*   **Bounding Box:** Define a box based on the walls.\n*   **Flood Fill:** Turn all empty space (background) inside the box into the expander color.\n*   **Stripes?** Based on the examples it looks like there aren't any.\n*   **No Overwriting:** Walls and the existing shape must be maintained.\n*   **Final Solution:** Change the background (9s or 7s) to the unique expanding color (8s) only within the bounding box. The wall logic is key!\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation logic from the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Task:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:**\n    *   The grid consists of a \"Header\" (Rows 0-5) and a \"Main Grid\" (Rows 6+).\n    *   The Header acts as a **Key** or instruction set. Rows 1-4 contain vertical bars of colors separated by grey (5) columns.\n    *   The Main Grid contains obstacles (colored regions), a background color (usually varying, 9 in the test case), and a \"seed\" of 8s (Teal) that expands.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic (Inferred from Examples):**\n    *   The transformation is a **Flood Fill** operation of color **8** starting from the initial 8-block.\n    *   The fill is constrained by a **Bounding Box** defined by the surrounding \"Wall\" colors.\n    *   **The Key's Role:** The key specifies properties for each wall color. Specifically, it seems to define \"Stripes\" or \"Extensions\" of 8s.\n        *   In Example 3, we see vertical stripes of 8s extending the full height of the grid, adjacent to the vertical walls.\n        *   The side of the stripe is determined by the Key code:\n            *   Code `C 0 0 0` (Left column filled) implies an effect related to the \"Negative\" direction (Left or Up).\n            *   Code `0 0 0 C` (Right column filled) implies an effect related to the \"Positive\" direction (Right or Down).\n        *   Specifically, for Vertical Walls:\n            *   **Key Right (`0 0 0 C`)**: Creates a vertical stripe of 8s on the **Right** (Positive X) side of the wall.\n            *   **Key Left (`C 0 0 0`)**: Creates a vertical stripe of 8s on the **Left** (Negative X) side of the wall.\n            *   These stripes appear even if they are \"outside\" the central room, provided they are within grid boundaries.\n    *   **The Fill Logic:**\n        *   The 8s fill the rectangular region defined by the intersection of the \"inner faces\" of the walls.\n        *   Left Boundary: Determined by the rightmost edge of Left Walls.\n        *   Right Boundary: Determined by the leftmost edge of Right Walls.\n        *   Top Boundary: Determined by the bottom edge of Top Walls.\n        *   Bottom Boundary: Determined by the top edge of Bottom Walls.\n        *   The fill does not \"leak\" through diagonal gaps in the corners (as seen in Example 3). It strictly fills the logical bounding box.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Walls:**\n        *   **Color 2 (Red):** Top Wall (Rows 6-8). Spans Cols 0-20.\n        *   **Color 1 (Blue):** Left Wall (Rows 12-22). Spans Cols 0-2.\n        *   **Color 3 (Green):** Right Wall (Rows 6-21).

Wall is at x=0. Stripe would be x=-1 (Off grid). -> **No visible stripe.**\n        *   **Wall 3 (Right):** Key Right -> Stripe on Right. Wall is at x=23. Stripe would be x=24 (Off grid). -> **No visible stripe.**\n        *   **Wall 2 (Top):** Key Left (Negative/Up). Stripe Above? Off grid. -> **No visible stripe.**\n        *   **Wall 4 (Bottom):** Key Left (Negative/Up). Stripe Above (Inner)? It merges with the fill. -> **No extra visible stripe.**\n    *   **Result:**\n        *   The transformation is simply filling the rectangle **x=[3, 20], y=[9, 22]** with 8s.\n        *   Areas outside this rectangle (including the \"gaps\" at the corners, like Row 9 Cols 0-2) retain their original background color (9).\n        *   Original walls are preserved.\n\n**Detailed Step-by-Step Construction of Output:**\n1.  **Copy Header (Rows 0-5):** Identical to input.\n2.  **Rows 6-8:** Contain Wall 2 (Cols 0-20) and Wall 3 (Cols 21-23).

examples and applying that generalization to a test case.  My initial observation is that each input grid is structured into two parts: an instruction section at the top and a map or pattern section below.\n\nI started by methodically analyzing the examples, noting repeated elements. In Example 1, I saw an instruction bar containing \"blocks\" that seemed to visually encode some rules. These blocks involved colors and empty spaces, which I initially thought might represent directions. The output grid showed that wires drawn with a new color, which connected distinct regions with different colors. By carefully examining how these regions transformed, the color 8 (teal) wires connect different shapes on the lower map to each other, so the 8s were the connections.\n\nI had to re-examine the instruction format. In Example 2, I noticed that the colors in the blocks in the instruction bar seemingly link to the output by forming the \"wires\". I started to form a hypothesis that the non-zero value inside the slots might have a directional meaning, perhaps indicating where a wire should be placed relative to the central \"origin\" or central shape. In Example 2, the wire goes up, and the instruction bar pointed upward as well. This gave me the idea of an L, U, R, D mapping for wires to neighbor colors.\n\nAs I dug deeper, I realized a crucial piece: the wires were \"connecting\" objects based on *matching* colors, meaning the value in the \"instructions\" was the *color* to connect to, not the direction itself. I also noticed that the \"wires\" could have different appearances: in some cases, they are continuous lines, in others they were isolated \"markers\". The background color seemed to play a role in this \"Remote Marker\" effect.\n\nAfter some trial and error, I found the positions in the slots of a block are tied to the direction of each wire. From there, I needed to generalize my observations on Examples 1, 2, and 3, in order to make a conclusion on the rule for each position.\n\nNow that I've uncovered the core mechanic, I need to translate these findings to a concrete strategy for processing the test input. So, if I understand things correctly:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Grid:** Recognize a center region and identify its neighbors (the colors).\n2.  **Read the Instructions:** Use the instruction section to connect the center to the neighbors. Each instruction has a target (neighbor), and a direction (from L, U, R, or D).\n3.  **Construct the Output:**  Create wires between the identified neighbors by matching up the directions to their respective neighbors.\n\nFrom this investigation, I know, I need to look for matching colors in the instructions, then make the connections from the center shape in a specific way. I believe I have the right model now. Let's see if it works!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to infer a transformation rule from three solved examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Task:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:**\n    *   **Top Section (Rows 0-5):** Contains a set of \"instructions\". The rows form visual slots separated by gray (5) borders. Each slot contains a color code (and a position).\n        *   The instruction format is `5, A, B, C, D, 5`. The non-zero value represents a target color.\n        *   The sequence of instructions (Slot 1 to Slot 4) corresponds to the four cardinal directions relative to a central object in the map below.\n        *   Based on the examples and the test input, the mapping is:\n            *   **Slot 1 -> Left** neighbor.\n            *   **Slot 2 -> Right** neighbor.\n            *   **Slot 3 -> Up** neighbor.\n            *   **Slot 4 -> Down** neighbor.\n            *   *(Note: This mapping is derived specifically from the Test Input's unique set of neighbor colors 1, 3, 2, 4 matching the instruction order 1, 3, 2, 4. In other examples, the instructions simply list the colors of the neighbors present).*\n    *   **Bottom Section (Rows 6+):** A map containing:\n        *   A central block of Teal (8) pixels.\n        *   Various neighbor blocks of different colors (e.g., Blue 1, Red 2, Green 3, Yellow 4).\n        *   A background color (e.g., Green 3, Blue 1, Orange 7, Maroon 9).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   The goal is to connect the central Teal (8) block to its neighbors using Teal (8) \"wires\".\n    *   The instructions tell us which neighbors to connect to. The instructions list the colors of the neighbors in specific directions.\n    *   **Logic:** For each direction (Left, Right, Up, Down), check if there is a neighbor. If the instruction confirms the neighbor (or if the \"Find Color\" logic matches), draw a connection.\n    *   **Connection Style:**\n        *   The connection is a straight line of Teal (8) pixels.\n        *   The width/thickness of the wire matches the dimensions of the central block's face in that direction.\n        *   The wire extends from the central block through the background until it touches the target neighbor.\n    *   **Test Input Specifics:**\n        *   **Center:** Teal (8) block at Rows 13-16, Columns 8-10.\n        *   **Left Neighbor:** Blue (1) block at Cols 0-2.\n        *   **Right Neighbor:** Green (3) block at Cols 21-23.\n        *   **Up Neighbor:** Red (2) block at Rows 6-8.\n        *   **Down Neighbor:** Yellow (4) block at Rows 23-25.\n        *   **Instructions:**\n            *   Slot 1: `1` (Blue) -> Matches Left Neighbor.\n            *   Slot 2: `3` (Green) -> Matches Right Neighbor.\n            *   Slot 3: `2` (Red) -> Matches Up Neighbor.\n            *   Slot 4: `4` (Yellow) -> Matches Down Neighbor.\n        *   **Action:** Connect all four neighbors to the center.\n\n3.  **Drawing the Output:**\n    *   **Horizontal Wires:** Extend from the side of the 8-block (Rows 13-16).\n        *   **Left:** From Col 8 to Col 2 (Target). Fill Cols 3-7.\n        *   **Right:** From Col 10 to Col 21 (Target).

The initial analysis reveals a pattern: large grids, distinct sections separated by a full row of a certain color. The top section seems to have \"instructions,\" while the bottom holds the \"map\" or game board.\n\n**Decoding the Instruction Grid**\n\nExample 1 made me realize that the top sections contain specific patterns, particularly in vertical blocks with different colors. I noticed that the sequence of these colored blocks might define an order of operation, kind of a 'path' that needs to be followed.\n\nAfter further dissection, I concluded that the instruction blocks are, in essence, a list of target colors.  This hypothesis was reinforced by the consistent pattern of these colors being present in the output grid and the colors not on the list, remaining untouched.\n\nThe \"Position\" (e.g., the position of the non-zero pixel within the 4-column block) kept appearing, so I tried to map it to a direction, trying various possibilities, like Up/Down/Left/Right, or a relative direction from the starting point. But, that wasn't working. Then, I considered it was relative to the \"Starting Point\" which is the 8. So it does not matter.\n\n**From Instructions to Pathing**\n\nThe most promising idea was that the \"Position\" (0 or 3), combined with the \"Color\", was the instruction and it specified that specific colors were targets, and the path to be modified.\n\n**Algorithm and Approach**\n\nThe logic crystallized: the top section defines the target colors, I search for these, and then paths of the starting block 8s, extend from the starting point to reach the respective target color blocks. The path is always the same width as the start block.\n\n**Refinement and Implementation**\n\nThe Test Input analysis solidified the approach. The key is now: Extract the target colors from the top section and build paths from the 3x3 block to each target, and ensure I transform all valid targets to complete the solution.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\nEach input consists of two sections:\n1.  **Top Section (Instruction Header):** The first 6 rows. It contains a border of 5s and a repeating pattern of 4 columns. Inside each 4-column block, there is a specific color (1-4, 6, etc.) and a position (the non-zero color is at one of the 4 positions). This section acts as a list of instructions.\n2.  **Bottom Section (Game Grid):** The rest of the grid. It contains a \"start\" block of color 8 (Teal) in the center, a background color, and several \"target\" regions of different colors located at the edges (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).\n\n**Rule Inference:**\n1.  **Instructions:** The Top Section lists the colors that the central 8-block must connect to.\n    *   In Example 1, colors 1, 6, 4, 2 are listed. In the grid, regions 1, 4, 2 are present (6 is missing). The output shows connections to 1, 4, and 2.\n    *   In Example 2, colors 2, 4, 6, 3 are listed. All are present. The output shows connections to all of them.\n    *   In Example 3, colors 4, 6, 3, 2 are listed. All are present. The output shows connections to all of them.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The goal is to draw a path from the central 8-block to every target color region listed in the Top Section that exists in the Bottom Section.\n\n2.  **Path Construction:**\n    *   **Color:** The path is made of color 8 (same as the start block).\n    *   **Shape:** The paths are straight lines extending from the start block to the target regions (Up, Down, Left, Right).\n    *   **Width:** The width of the path matches the dimensions of the start block.\n        *   In Examples 1-3, the start block is 2x2, and the paths are 2 pixels wide.\n        *   In the Test Input, the start block is 3x3 (rows 13-15, cols 8-10), so the paths must be 3 pixels wide/high.\n    *   **Extent:** The path extends through the empty background space until it touches the target region. It does not overwrite the target region itself.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Parse Top Section:** The header contains the colors `1`, `3`, `2`, `4`.\n    *   Block 1: `1` (Blue)\n    *   Block 2: `3` (Green)\n    *   Block 3: `2` (Red)\n    *   Block 4: `4` (Yellow)\n    *   *Instruction:* Connect the central 8-block to regions 1, 3, 2, and 4.\n\n2.  **Analyze Bottom Section:**\n    *   **Start Block (8):** Located at Rows 13-15, Columns 8-10. Dimensions are 3x3.\n    *   **Target 1 (Blue):** Located on the Left edge (Columns 0-2).\n    *   **Target 3 (Green):** Located on the Right edge (Columns 21-23).\n    *   **Target 2 (Red):** Located on the Top edge (Rows 6-8).\n    *   **Target 4 (Yellow):** Located on the Bottom edge (Rows 23-25).\n    *   **Background:** Color 9 (Maroon).\n\n3.  **Construct Paths:**\n    *   **To Top (2):** Extend a 3-wide path UP from the start block.\n        *   Columns: 8, 9, 10.\n        *   Rows: From the top of the start block (Row 13) up to the bottom of the target (Row 8).\n        *   Fill Rows 9, 10, 11, 12 with 8s.\n    *   **To Bottom (4):** Extend a 3-wide path DOWN from the start block.\n        *   Columns: 8, 9, 10.\n        *   Rows: From the bottom of the start block (Row 15) down to the top of the target (Row 23).\n        *   Fill Rows 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 with 8s.\n    *   **To Left (1):** Extend a 3-high path LEFT from the start block.\n        *   Rows: 13, 14, 15.\n        *   Columns: From the left of the start block (Col 8) left to the right of the target (Col 2).\n        *   Fill Columns 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 with 8s.\n    *   **To Right (3):** Extend a 3-high path RIGHT from the start block.\n        *   Rows: 13, 14, 15.\n        *   Columns: From the right of the start block (Col 10) right to the left of the target (Col 21).\n        *   Fill Columns 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 with 8s.\n\n4.  **Final Output:** The output consists of the Bottom Section (starting from row 6) with the added

In each box there is exactly one nonzero/non-5 color (call it `c`), placed either:\n\n- at the **left inside** of the box  \u2192 `c` makes a beam turn **counterclockwise** (left turn)\n- at the **right inside** of the box \u2192 `c` makes a beam turn **clockwise** (right turn)\n\n(That left-vs-right turn mapping is consistent across the solved examples.)\n\n**3) In the lower grid, the color 8 block is a \u201cbeam source\u201d.**  \nFind the connected 8-colored block; its bounding box size defines the **beam thickness**:\n- horizontal travel uses a strip with the source\u2019s **height**\n- vertical travel uses a strip with the source\u2019s **width**\n\n**4) Draw 4 thick beams (up/down/left/right) that \u201cbounce\u201d on colored obstacles.**  \nLet the **background** be the color in the lower grid that is **not** 8 and not one of the instructed colors (in the examples it\u2019s the big fill color; here it is 9).\n\nFor each of the four directions:\n- move the thick strip forward through background (and already-drawn 8), painting those cells **8**\n- stop when the strip would enter a colored obstacle cell (one of the instructed colors)\n- turn 90\u00b0 according to that obstacle color\u2019s turn rule (clockwise or counterclockwise) and continue\n- stop if moving would go out of the grid\n- never overwrite the obstacle colors themselves\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test\n\nInstruction panel (top) gives:\n- color **1** = left-side marker \u2192 **counterclockwise**\n- color **3** = right-side marker \u2192 **clockwise**\n- color **2** = left-side marker \u2192 **counterclockwise**\n- color **4** = left-side marker \u2192 **counterclockwise**\n\nIn the lower grid:\n- background is **9**\n- the 8 source is a **3\u00d73** block \u2192 beams are thickness **3**\n\nSimulating the 4 bouncing beams produces the following 24\u00d724 output grid.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inference from the solved examples\n\nEach input has two parts:\n\n1. **A 6-row \u201clegend\u201d at the top**, framed by color `5`.\n   - Inside are four 4\u00d74 blocks.\n   - In each block, one nonzero color forms a **vertical line** either on the **left edge** of the 4\u00d74 block or on the **right edge**.\n   - This tells how that color behaves when hit by a \u201cbeam\u201d:\n     - line on **left edge**  \u2192 that color makes the beam **turn left** (90\u00b0 counterclockwise)\n     - line on **right edge** \u2192 that color makes the beam **turn right** (90\u00b0 clockwise)\n\n2. **The main board below the legend** (this is what the output is based on).\n   - There is a solid block of color `8` (the \u201cbeam source\u201d).\n   - One color is the **background** (the most frequent color in the main board).\n   - Other colored rectangles/blocks act like \u201cmirrors\u201d that turn the beam according to the legend.\n\n### Beam propagation rule (matches all examples)\n\nLet the `8` source block have size **H\u00d7W**.

So the output grid is the input grid with the first 6 rows cropped off.\n\n2. **The legend encodes a \u201cturn rule\u201d for each color.**  \n   The legend consists of 4 small 6\u00d74 panels. Each panel contains one color placed either:\n   - on the **left** side of the panel\u2019s interior, or\n   - on the **right** side.\n   \n   From the solved examples, this placement tells how a moving \u201cbeam/block\u201d turns when it hits that color:\n   - **color shown on the left \u21d2 turn LEFT (counterclockwise)**\n   - **color shown on the right \u21d2 turn RIGHT (clockwise)**\n\n3. **In the lower area (\u201carena\u201d), the 8-colored square is the moving block.**  \n   The block is a solid k\u00d7k square of color 8 (k=2 in the examples; in the test it is 3\u00d73).  \n   From that block, four rays are traced (up, down, left, right). Each ray:\n   - travels through the background (here mostly 9),\n   - stops just before it would enter a colored rectangle,\n   - then **turns 90\u00b0 left or right depending on the hit color\u2019s legend rule**, and continues,\n   - stops when it exits the grid.\n   \n   All traversed background cells are painted **8**; the obstacle rectangles keep their original colors.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test\n\n**Step A: Crop off the top 6 rows.**  \nThis leaves a **24\u00d724** arena.\n\n**Step B: Read turn rules from the legend panels (top section).**\n- Color **1** is on the left \u21d2 turn **LEFT**\n- Color **3** is on the right \u21d2 turn **RIGHT**\n- Color **2** is on the left \u21d2 turn **LEFT**\n- Color **4** is on the left \u21d2 turn **LEFT**\n\n**Step C: Find the 8-block in the arena.**  \nIt is a **3\u00d73** block at rows 8\u201310, cols 9\u201311 (within the cropped arena).\n\n**Step D: Trace rays (up/down/left/right) with those turn rules** and paint all traversed cells

header\nIn every example the first **6 rows** are a \u201ckey header\u201d on color **5** (with 0\u2019s and colored bars).  \nThe output is made only from the rows **below** that header.  \nSo for the test, remove rows 1\u20136 and work on the remaining **24\u00d724** board.\n\n### 2) Read the keys = turning rules\nEach key object is a 4\u00d7(3+1) shape: **three 0\u2019s** plus a **1-cell-wide vertical bar** of some color.\n- **Bar on the left of the 0\u2019s \u21d2 that color means \u201cturn LEFT\u201d**\n- **Bar on the right of the 0\u2019s \u21d2 that color means \u201cturn RIGHT\u201d**\n\nFrom the test header:\n- color **1**: bar-left \u21d2 **LEFT turn**\n- color **3**: bar-right \u21d2 **RIGHT turn**\n- color **2**: bar-left \u21d2 **LEFT turn**\n- color **4**: bar-left \u21d2 **LEFT turn**\n\n### 3) Main drawing rule (ray tracing with width = seed size)\nOn the main board, find the existing connected **8** \u201cseed\u201d.  \nIn this test it is a **3\u00d73** block, so the lattice stroke width is **3**.\n\nFrom the seed, send 4 thick \u201crays\u201d (north/south/east/west).  \nA ray:\n- paints **background cells** (here background is **9**) into **8**\n- stops when the next step would hit a **non-background block** (1/2/3/4 here) or the edge\n- if it stops because it hit a colored block that has a key, it **turns 90\u00b0** left/right according to that block\u2019s key and continues as a new ray (same thickness)\n\nApplying this to the test board produces these 3-wide bands of 8:\n- a vertical band through the seed up/down until blocked (hits the 2-block above and the 4-block below)\n- a horizontal band through the seed left/right until blocked (hits the 1-block on the left and the 3-block on the right)\n- plus the turned rays:\n  - hitting **2** above turns **left** \u2192 adds the upper horizontal band\n  - hitting **1** left turns **left** \u2192 adds the left vertical band downward\n  - hitting **3** right turns **right** \u2192 adds the right vertical band downward\n  - hitting **4** below turns **left** \u2192 adds the lower horizontal band to the right\n\nBlocks (1/2/3/4) are never overwritten.\n\n---\n\n## Output

from the solved examples\n\n1. **Crop away the header (the \u201ckey\u201d area).**  \n   In every training example, the first **6 rows** are a header made of color **5** with four 4\u00d74 key objects (0\u2019s + a colored bar). The output is the grid **below** that header. So we remove the top 6 rows.\n\n2. **Read the keys as \u201cturn rules\u201d for the moving 8-band.**  \n   Each key object is a 4\u00d73 block of **0** with an adjacent 4\u00d71 colored bar.\n   - If the **colored bar is on the left** of the 0\u2019s, that color means **turn left (counter\u2011clockwise)** when hit.\n   - If the **colored bar is on the right** of the 0\u2019s, that color means **turn right (clockwise)** when hit.\n\n3. **Use the existing 8-object as the \u201cbrush\u201d and trace 4 rays.**\n   - Find the connected **8** object in the cropped board; its bounding box size gives the **thickness** of the band (in examples it\u2019s 2\u00d72; here it\u2019s 3\u00d73).\n   - From that 8 block, trace **four** thick \u201crays\u201d (bands): **up, down, left, right**.\n   - A ray paints background cells with **8** until the next step would enter a **non\u2011background, non\u20118** color (a solid block). It stops just before the block, then **turns 90\u00b0** according to that block color\u2019s key rule, and continues. The ray stops when it reaches the **grid edge**. Solid blocks are never overwritten.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test\n\n- After cropping 6 rows, the board is **24\u00d724**.\n- The key rules from the header are:\n  - Color **1**: bar-left \u21d2 **turn left (CCW)**\n  - Color **3**: bar-right \u21d2 **turn right (CW)**\n  - Color **2**: bar-left \u21d2 **turn left (CCW)**\n  - Color **4**: bar-left \u21d2 **turn left (CCW)**\n- The existing 8 seed is a **3\u00d73** block, so the band thickness is **3**.\n- Tracing the four rays with these turns produces the lattice shown below.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"G\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_17_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### 1) Read the \u201cturn rules\u201d from the header, then crop it off\nIn the first 6 rows the background is 5 and there are four 4\u00d74 \u201ckey\u201d gadgets made of three 0s plus a 4\u00d71 colored bar.\n\nFor each key color:\n- if the colored bar is **on the left** of the 0s (pattern `c,0,0,0`) \u21d2 that color means **turn LEFT**\n- if the colored bar is **on the right** of the 0s (pattern `0,0,0,c`) \u21d2 that color means **turn RIGHT**\n\nFrom the test header we get:\n- color **1**: left of 0s \u21d2 **LEFT**\n- color **3**: right of 0s \u21d2 **RIGHT**\n- color **2**: left of 0s \u21d2 **LEFT**\n- color **4**: left of 0s \u21d2 **LEFT**\n\nThen remove (crop away) the top 6 header rows.

The core idea is that we're given an input grid, and we need to transform it based on some hidden rules. My initial focus is on the data structure: two distinct sections, a 'header' and a 'main board'. The header seems to contain the keys to the puzzle.\n\nHere\u2019s what I'm seeing:\n*   **The Big Picture:** The main action happens on the 'main board'\u2014it gets cropped to the correct output size.\n*   **The Key Ingredients:** Inside the header, I see what I'm calling \"Small Key Objects\". They seem important, with a colored vertical bar and a black block. The relative position of the bar (left or right of the black block) looks like a crucial key (pun intended!).\n*   **Deciphering the Bar Code:** I've scrutinized several examples to spot any patterns. For example, in the Test Input, the positions of the bars are as follows: Bar 1 is LEFT of the zeroes, Bar 3 is RIGHT of the zeroes, Bar 2 is LEFT of the zeroes, and Bar 4 is LEFT of the zeroes.\n\nNow, the main board has a 'seed', which is a colored block (color 8, teal). The main goal is to expand the teal block into an organized structure. After that, I need to focus on what happens to the background blocks.\n\nThe core of the transformation is about drawing lines from a teal seed. Then I figure that the header keys must tell us which sides to draw lines against. It's a lattice expansion: It's a regular grid where lines intersect or define cells or segments.\n\nThe keys indicate extra lines next to specific blocks. A \"left\" bar, which means a line should go to the left of the block. A \"right\" bar, which means a line should go to the right of the block. But where, vertically and horizontally? That's where I need to pay attention, I need to match the key with directions.\n\nI've got a new algorithm hypothesis:\n1.  **Parse Header Keys:** Identify colors and direction (left or right).\n2.  **Lattice Origins:** Use the seed 8s to define horizontal and vertical grid origins.\n3.  **Define Grid Period/Spacing:**\n    *   Find the key-relevant blocks.\n    *   For each active block, determine line target position from the key.\n    *   Figure out the seed and Block Distances.\n4.  I can draw 8-color lattice lines that may or may not overlap with the solid blocks.\n5.  There's also a \"Fill\" step with 8s (color 8).\n\nBased on those thoughts, here\u2019s how I\u2019m going to construct the output:\n1.  **Initialize:** 9 as the background, a new grid.\n2.  **Horizontal Lines:** Draw the teal lines at rows: 1-3, 7-9, 13-15, 19-21.\n3.  **Vertical Lines:** Draw teal lines at cols: 0-2, 4-6, 8-10, 12-14, 16-18, 20-22.\n4.  **Overlay**: copy non-9 pixels from the original main board.\n\nReady to code.\n\n\nThe solution involves generating a lattice of color 8 (teal) lines on the main board, while preserving the existing colored objects and the background color.\n\n**Logic:**\n1.  **Crop Header:** The input grid contains a header (rows 0-5) separated by a line of 5s. This header contains \"Key\" objects that define the lattice generation rules. The output grid corresponds to the Main Board (rows 6-29 of the input).\n2.  **Identify Lattice Parameters:**\n    *   **Line Width:** Determined by the size of the \"Seed\" object (color 8) in the Main Board. In the test input, the seed is a 3x3 block, so the lattice lines are **3 pixels wide**.\n    *   **Seed Position:** The seed is located at Output Rows 7-9 (Input Rows 13-15) and Output Cols 8-10. This anchors the grid.\n3.  **Determine Grid Spacing from Keys:**\n    *   The header contains keys consisting of a colored bar and a block of 0s. The position of the bar (Left or Right of 0s) dictates the alignment of lattice lines relative to the blocks of that color in the Main Board.\n    *   **Vertical Grid:**\n        *   **Key 4 (Left):** Refers to Block 4 (Yellow). The \"Left\" key implies a line adjacent to the Top (for horizontal blocks) or Left (for vertical blocks) side. Block 4 is horizontal (Rows 17-19, Cols 7-16). Its Left side is Col 7. A 3-pixel wide line adjacent to the left would be **Cols 4-6**.\n        *   Comparing the Seed (Cols 8-10) with this Line (Cols 4-6), the gap is 1 pixel (Col 7).\n        *   **Pattern:** 3-pixel line, 1-pixel gap.\n        *   **Vertical Lines:** Cols 0-2, 4-6, 8-10, 12-14, 16-18, 20-22.\n    *   **Horizontal Grid:**\n        *   **Key 3 (Right):** Refers to Block 3 (Green). The \"Right\" key implies a line adjacent to the Bottom or Right side. Block 3 is vertical (Rows 0-12). Its Bottom is Row 12.

My goal is to figure out how these \"keys\" in the top header relate to the cool lattice patterns that expand in the main board. It's a spatial puzzle with some key geometric rules.\n\n**1. Data Breakdown: The Grid's Anatomy**\n\nThe input is split: header at the top and the main board below. The header has these interesting \"keys\". They are essentially vertical bars of a specific color, followed by an empty space of \"0s\" of the same height. The main board is a bigger grid filled with color blocks and a background color. My task involves understanding how the header keys dictate the expansion of a \"teal-colored 8-lattice\" on the main board. \n\n*   **Key Structure:** `[Color][0][0][0]` or `[0][0][0][Color]` is key. These keys appear in each test case.\n*   **Main Board:** Has solid colored rectangular blocks, a background color, and sometimes these \"teal 8\" seeds. These act as obstacles.\n\n**2. Deciphering the \"Lattice Game\"**\n\nMy hypothesis is that the position of the color within the key tells us something about how the lattice expands relative to the blocks on the main board. Let's look at the relationship between the keys and the lines, especially the starting seed.\n\n*   **Key Direction**: Where is the color block? Is it to the left or right of the empty space? My thought is, that the empty space in the Key, means there are 0s to the left, 0s to the right. This will map into an expansion direction. This is based on examining the test cases.\n*   **Lattice lines:** These are thin horizontal and vertical bands that appear on the board. They start from the \"seed\" (an existing 2x2/3x3 block of 8s) and from the edges of the solid color blocks.\n\n**3. Test Case Analysis**\n\nTo solve this, I will work through the provided examples and try to generalize the rules for the test input.\n\n*   **Test Case 1**\n    *   **Seed:** Starting with some existing 8s.\n    *   **Keys:** `[1|000]`, `[4|000]`, and `[2|000]`.\n    *   **Result:** A vertical lattice line to the right of Block 1 (Color 1). Vertical line to the left of block 4.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** If the bar is to the left, the lattice is to the right. The relative positions of the color block and the 0s in the key seem to correlate with the lattice lines. If the key is *[Color] [0 0 0]*, then the lattice band will go to the right of [Color] blocks.\n*   **Test Case 2:**\n    *   Keys: `[000|2]`, `[4|000]`, `[000|6]` `[3|000]`\n    *   Result: If a key is rightmost, the line is on the left.\n*   **Test Case 3:**\n    *   Keys: `[000|4]`, `[6|000]`, `[3|000]`, `[000|2]`\n    *   More of the same, which confirms the pattern of line direction and bar position.\n*   **Test Input:** The Goal. There is a seed. Key: `[1|000]` ... and what about Block 2 and 4?\n\n**4. Refining the Rule: Edges and Inner Space**\n\nThe keys dictate the blocks to spawn these grid lines. They are not direct spawners of the lines, but they mark the spot. The Key points to the \"inner space\". Now, for horizontal, or vertical blocks, the directions of lattice are at 90 degrees. Key `[C|000]` means the lattice expands toward the right.\n\n**5. Applying the \"Inner Edge\" Rule**\n\n1.  Background: Color 9.\n2.  Seed: Identify the seed in the main board. This will act as our starting point.\n3.  Seed Expansion: Expand the seed vertically and horizontally. This will construct a rectangular box in the center of the output.\n4.  Apply Keys to Solid Blocks: Based on a key like: `[Bar][0][0][0]` which means to look at blocks with their left facing sides. `000[Bar]` means right facing. For those blocks that are identified by the key, generate a\n\nTo solve the ARC task, we analyze the input to understand the transformation rules based on the provided examples.\n\n**1. Analysis of Input and Output:**\n- The input consists of a **Header** (top rows separated by a row of 5s) and a **Main Board** (the grid below).\n- The **Header** contains \"Key Objects\": 4x4 blocks consisting of a vertical bar of a specific color and a 3-column block of black (0). The relative position of the colored bar (Left or Right of the 0s) is the critical code.\n- The **Main Board** contains a background color (9 in the test case), solid rectangular blocks of colors (1, 2, 3, 4), and a \"Seed\" of color 8 (a 3x3 block in the test case).\n- The **Output** is the Main Board with a newly generated \"Lattice\" of color 8 lines. The header is removed.\n\n**2. Transformation Logic:**\n- **Preservation:** The background color and solid colored blocks from the Main Board are preserved.\n- **Lattice Generation:**\n    - The **Seed** (existing 8s) expands horizontally and vertically into bands of 8s (3 pixels wide, matching the seed size). These bands stop when they hit a solid block or the grid edge.\n    - The **Keys** in the header dictate additional lattice bands spawned from the solid blocks.\n- **Key Decoding:**\n    - A Key is composed of a colored bar and a block of 0s (space).\n    - **Rule:** The lattice band spawns adjacent to the block of the corresponding color, on the \"Inner\" side (the side facing the center of the grid / the void).\n    - Specifically, the position of the `0`s in the key relative to the colored bar indicates the direction of the lattice relative to the block's bar-like edge:\n        - `Key: [Color][0][0][0]` (Bar Left, 0s Right) $\\rightarrow$ Lattice appears to the **Right** (or Bottom for top blocks) of the block.\n        - `Key: [0][0][0][Color]` (Bar Right, 0s Left) $\\rightarrow$ Lattice appears to the **Left** (or Top for bottom blocks) of the block.\n    - In the Test Case:\n        - **Key 1 (Left Bar):** Block 1 (Left Wall) $\\rightarrow$ Spawn Vertical Lattice on **Right**.\n        - **Key 3 (Right Bar):** Block 3 (Right Wall) $\\rightarrow$ Spawn Vertical Lattice on **Left**.\n        - **Key 2 (Left Bar):** Block 2 (Top Wall) $\\rightarrow$ Spawn Horizontal Lattice on **Bottom**.\n        - **Key 4 (Left Bar):** Block 4 (Bottom Wall) $\\rightarrow$ Spawn Horizontal Lattice on **Top**.\n\n**3.

Background color is 9.\n- **Objects:**\n    - **Block 2 (Top):** Rows 1-3, Cols 0-20.\n    - **Block 3 (Right):** Rows 1-13, Cols 21-23.\n    - **Block 1 (Left):** Rows 7-16, Cols 0-2.\n    - **Block 4 (Bottom):** Rows 18-20, Cols 7-15.\n    - **Seed:** Rows 8-10, Cols 8-10 (Input relative to main board matches output).\n- **Generated Lattice Lines (Width 3):**\n    1.  **Seed Vertical:** Cols 8-10.

My goal is to analyze the provided examples, deduce the underlying rule, and then apply it to the final test input to generate the correct output. I'll approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, I notice that the input grids are divided into two sections, separated by a gray horizontal line. The top section seems like a control panel or a legend of some sort. The bottom section is where the main action happens\u2014a grid with different colored regions.\n\nI've got a theory that the top section's colors are somehow key to how the bottom section is altered. I'm focusing on the idea that these top colors might represent walls or barriers, and that the other colors behave like fluids that expand and move.\n\nI carefully examined each example, trying to understand what changes between the input and output. The key insight is that the bottom grid colors are either solid barriers (walls) that do not move, or fluids, and the first item controls the rules (left = fill the container, right = fill upwards). So, the first item gives the physics rules. Then I identified the fluid, which is usually the smaller block. Finally, I will do a fill.\n\nI've tested the hypothesis on each example and determined that if the control panel color alignment (First block) is to the left, then I need to fill all non-barrier pixels from the seed (the fluid color). If the control panel is to the right, then I need to fill all non-barrier pixels, from the seed. This is my core transformation rule.\n\nNow, let's go apply the rule to the provided test input. The alignment of the first item is left, meaning to fill all.\n1. Determine the Wall colors.\n2. Determine the Fluid Color.\n3. Replace the background with the Fluid.\n\nI'm ready to tackle the test input and generate the final output. The goal is to fully fill from the fluid (8) seed into the non-barrier area of the grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Structure:** The input grids consist of a \"Control Panel\" at the top (rows 0-5) and a main \"Scene\" below (rows 6+). The output corresponds to the Scene, transformed.\n2.  **Control Panel:** The top rows contain sequences like `5, C, 0, 0, 0`. The color `C` defines a \"Wall\" material. The position of `C` within the block (Left-aligned `C,0,0,0` vs Right-aligned `0,0,0,C`) acts as a switch for the physics simulation rule.\n    *   **Example 1:** Walls are 1, 6, 4, 2. First block `1,0,0,0` is Left-aligned. Behavior: Fluid fills the entire connected \"empty\" space (Up, Down, Left, Right).\n    *   **Example 2:** Walls are 2, 4, 6, 3. First block `0,0,0,2` is Right-aligned. Behavior: Fluid (Gas) rises (Up) and spreads sideways, but does not go down.\n    *   **Example 3:** Walls are 4, 6, 3, 2. First block `0,0,0,4` is Right-aligned. Behavior: Fluid rises (Up) and spreads sideways.\n    *   **Test Input:** First block `1,0,0,0` is Left-aligned. We infer the behavior is **Full Fill** (like Example 1).\n3.  **Scene Components:**\n    *   **Walls:** Colors defined in the Control Panel act as barriers.\n    *   **Fluid:** A specific non-wall color forming a small seed/cluster (Color 8 in all examples).\n    *   **Background:** The remaining non-wall color (Color 3 in Ex 1, 1 in Ex 2, 7 in Ex 3, 9 in Test).\n4.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Identify Wall colors from the Control Panel: {1, 3, 2, 4}.\n    *   Identify Fluid (8) and Background (9) in the Scene.\n    *   Since the control is Left-aligned, perform a **Flood Fill** starting from the Fluid seeds (8), replacing all connected Background pixels (9).

The input seems to be a grid with a control panel and a main grid. My job is to transform the main grid based on instructions from the control panel.  The control panel has \"switches\" or \"indicators\" which I believe control changes in the main grid's color blocks.  I need to figure out the rule.  It looks like there is a horizontal gray line that separates the two sections.\n\n**Input Analysis and Pattern Recognition:**\n\nI'll dive into the input's structure, focusing on both the control panel and the main grid, particularly color patterns. I'm noting the repeating pattern of colors separated by black spaces. The control panel has vertical stripes of colors. I am examining Example 1's Control panel which seems to contain vertical blocks of information. It looks like the structure goes: `5, color, 0,0,0, 5` with 5's acting as separators and this pattern repeats across the row. The input size is 24 width. The grid content has a combination of colored regions of rectangular shape. Example 1's \"bottom section\" color is a large green background with a blue rectangle on left, a teal rectangle in center, a yellow rectangle to the right and a red rectangle at the bottom. The output has modifications compared to the input grid's bottom section. The transformation happens to the bottom section. I need to figure out the relationship between control panel and changes to main grid.\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation and Iterative Refinement:**\n\nI am carefully analyzing the relationship between the control panel and the resulting output grid. I notice in Example 1, a Teal rectangle expands significantly from Input to Output.  I'm tracking the transformation in Example 1 to analyze. It appears the blue, yellow, and red regions remain the same, but Teal 8 expands. I re-read the example 1 output carefully. There's two 8 pixel blocks in output Row 0. The output height is smaller than input. So the top control panel is removed in the output. Based on this example, it seems the region associated with the 'missing' color expands.\n\nI'm checking out Example 2's structure. Here, Example 2 has color 2 on left, 4 on the right, and 8 in the middle. The color 8 expands again. So 8 is the key. The expanded color is not present in the control panel. In Example 2, 8 (Teal) also expands. I realize the control panel has an association to the regions. In Example 3, Color 8 (Teal) expands. The input's color block has to match the control's color blocks.\n\n**Pattern Generalization and Rule Extraction:**\n\nI understand the core principle. The color absent in the control panel's \"switches\" is the \"active\" fluid. This \"active\" fluid region always expands into \"empty\" space. The 4 blocks, each defines a color and an implicit direction or \"action\" for a region in the grid. In Example 1, they were all positioned left. In Example 2 the values changed.  I have identified:  There are 4 blocks. There are 4 colors. It seems that there are 4 directions in which the color can be placed: left, right, up, down.  \n\n**Edge Case Analysis and Robustness Testing:**\n\nExample 1 is where everything is at the left. In Ex 2, Red is at right, Yellow is at left, Pink is at right, Green is at left. My main hypothesis: The position of the color in the block dictates the expansion direction of that color.  I realize there are only two positions in these rules, 0 or 3. I analyze these two conditions to decide about the expansion of color 8. In example 1, the 8 expanded up from the center, the position of 6 in control panel corresponds to position of color 8 and it has expanded. In example 2 I see it expanding up and horizontally. I see 2 has slot 4 and expands right while 4 has slot 1 which expands left.\nI am calling slot 0 and 3 Left and Right. But the expansion direction is not exactly like that. I am revisiting the control panel meaning, maybe it defines boundaries and maybe it defines forces for gravity. My hypothesis is that each slot position will relate to an expansion, and all these slot positions might be active at the same time. The test input has four blocks of 4 colors. The expansion direction may have a lot to do with direction.  This structure is probably the control panel.\n\n**Rule Formalization and Algorithm Design:**\n\nI hypothesize the Color can define the expansion in the output and that that position defines the expansion in the control panel. I think the position (\n\nThe input grids contain a \"control panel\" in the top 6 rows and a \"bottom section\" containing various colored regions. The task involves a transformation of the bottom section governed by the switches in the control panel.\n\n**Analysis of the Control Panel:**\nThe control panel is divided into 4 blocks (columns 1-4, 7-10, 13-16, 19-22), corresponding to 4 vertical strips of the grid (0-5, 6-11, 12-17, 18-23). Each block contains a specific color at a specific \"slot\" (position 0 or 3 within the block), indicating a switch setting.\nThe colors in the control panel determine whether the corresponding vertical strip is \"Active\" or \"Inactive\". An Active strip fills its empty space (background color) with a \"fluid\" color.\n\n**Logic derived from examples:**\n1.  **Fluid Color:** The color that appears in the grid but is *not* in the control panel is the fluid. In all examples and the test case, this color is **8 (Teal)**.\n2.  **Strip Activation Rules:**\n    *   **Yellow (4):** Always Active (regardless of slot).\n    *   **Blue (1):** Always Inactive.\n    *   **Green (3):** Inactive (observed at Slot 0). Assuming Inactive at Slot 3 unless it contains the Source.\n    *   **Red (2):** Active if Slot 3 (Right), Inactive if Slot 0 (Left).\n    *   **Pink (6):** Active if Slot 0 (Left), Inactive if Slot 3 (Right).\n3.  **Source Rule:** The strip containing the original source of the fluid (Color 8) is **Always Active**, overriding any Inactive status from the control panel.\n4.  **Filling Process:** In every Active strip, all background pixels (color 9 in the test case) are replaced by the fluid color (8). Existing objects (colors other than background or fluid) act as barriers and remain unchanged.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Strip 1 (Cols 0-5):** Control is **Blue (1)** at Slot 0 (Left). Rule: **Inactive**.\n*   **Strip 2 (Cols 6-11):** Control is **Green (3)** at Slot 3 (Right). Contains the Source (8). Rule: **Active** (Source Rule).\n*   **Strip 3 (Cols 12-17):** Control is **Red (2)** at Slot 0 (Left). Rule: **Inactive**.\n*   **Strip 4 (Cols 18-23):** Control is **Yellow (4)** at Slot 0 (Left). Rule: **Active**.\n\n**Transformation:**\n*   **Strip 1:** No change. (Retains Red, Blue, Background 9).\n*   **Strip 2:** Active. Background 9s become 8s. Existing objects (Red, Source 8, Yellow 4) are preserved.\n*   **Strip 3:** No change. (Retains Red, Yellow, Background 9).\n*   **Strip 4:** Active. Background 9s become 8s. Existing objects (Red, Green) are preserved.\n\noutput:\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"14\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Legend Section (Rows 0-5)**: Contains color indicators showing which direction lines extend from rectangles.

Observations:**\n1. The top 6 rows contain a template section (gray background with colored markers) that gets removed\n2. The main grid contains several colored rectangles and an 8 marker (small square)\n3.

At each rectangle's edge, draw perpendicular 8-lines:\n   - Left edge vertical extends down to the bottom horizontal\n   - Right edge vertical extends up from grid top to main horizontal\n   - Top horizontal extends left from 8's column to grid left\n   - Bottom horizontal extends from left edge to grid right (when left rectangle doesn't exist at that level)\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n- Main grid: 24\u00d724 (rows 6-29 of input)\n- Red (2): rows 0-2, cols 0-20 (TOP)\n- Green (3): rows 0-12, cols 21-23 (RIGHT)\n- Blue (1): rows 6-15, cols 0-2 (LEFT)\n- Yellow (4): rows 17-19, cols 7-15 (BOTTOM)\n- 8 marker: rows 7-9, cols 8-10 (3\u00d73, so lines are 3 cells wide)\n\nDrawing the 8-line structure:\n- Main horizontal: rows 7-9, cols 3-20\n- Main vertical: cols 8-10, rows 3-16\n- Top horizontal: rows 3-5, cols 0-10\n- Bottom horizontal: rows 14-16 (extending to col 23 at row 16 where blue ends)\n- Left edge vertical: cols 3-5, rows 3-16\n- Right edge vertical: cols 18-20, rows 0-9 (overlapped by red at rows 0-2)\n\n```\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"18\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**My strategy for solving this ARC task boils down to identifying the source, targets, and connection rules.**\n\n1.  **Understand the Inputs:** I start by meticulously analyzing the provided example grids, focusing on the input and corresponding output. I recognize the initial pattern as a grid with some additional patterns. The header contains essential information.\n\n2.  **Uncover the Core Logic:**  I've found that the core of the transformation centers around a \"source\" block (often cyan/teal, color 8) and a set of \"target\" shapes of different colors. The input's size is the grid size. The output removes the header. The output's size is equal to the main canvas.\n\n3.  **Establish Connections:** Lines start from the source and connect to targets in four directions (up, down, left, and right) based on where the source and target patterns overlap in the x or y axis.\n    *   If they overlap in the Y-axis (meaning the patterns are horizontally aligned), then there is a vertical line.\n    *   If they overlap in the X-axis (meaning the patterns are vertically aligned), then there is a horizontal line.\n\n4.  **Decipher the Header:** The header provides crucial data to determine the style of the line connections (solid or dashed). Each \"connection\" block (4 numbers) maps to a pattern. An index value of `0` in the header means a solid connection, and `3` denotes a dashed connection (two pixels on, two pixels off).\n\n5.  **Dashed Line Implementation:** If the connection is dashed, the line pattern has to scale depending on the source size.\n\n6.  **Handle Perpendicular Extensions (Edge Case):** I had a harder time understanding why there's a vertical or horizontal expansion line. It seems that this occurs when targets are not aligned. It happens when there is an unaligned horizontal expansion (to a target in the horizontal axis, but not in the vertical axis), but not in the reversed case. It's safe to assume that extra lines do not exist in the basic case.\n\n7.  **Generate the Output:** Based on the above observations, the output is generated as a CSV grid of width 24 and height 20. The key aspect is drawing the lines of the correct color according to the connections.\n\n8.  **Final Verification:** I always double-check my logic against the examples to ensure it works in all scenarios and that the code meets all specifications.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid by removing the header section and generating a pattern of lines on the main canvas. The \"source\" of these lines is the cyan (teal, color 8) block. The lines extend from this source to connect with other colored rectangles in the grid or the edges of the canvas. The specific style of the connection (solid vs. dashed) is determined by a code in the header section.\n\n**Reasoning Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Workspace:** The top 6 rows (0-5) are a header/legend and should be removed. The output grid corresponds to rows 6-25 of the input (the main canvas).\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:** In the test input's main canvas, there is a 3x3 block of cyan (8) pixels at rows 7-9 (relative to the canvas top) and columns 8-10. This is the source from which lines will extend.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Header for Rules:** The header consists of repeating blocks of 4 numbers. Each block corresponds to a color present in the grid. The position of the color number within its 4-number block dictates the line style:\n    *   **Index 0 (e.g., `1,0,0,0`):** Solid connection. The line fills all pixels between the source and the target.\n    *   **Index 3 (e.g., `0,0,0,3`):** Dashed connection. The line is drawn with a pattern of gaps.\n    *   **Mapping for Test Input:**\n        *   Blue (1): `1,0,0,0` -> **Solid**.\n        *   Green (3): `0,0,0,3` -> **Dashed**.\n        *   Red (2): `2,0,0,0` -> **Solid**.\n        *   Yellow (4): `4,0,0,0` -> **Solid**.\n\n4.  **Determine Geometry and Connections:**\n    *   **Source:** Rows 7-9, Cols 8-10 (3x3).\n    *   **Blue (Left):** Solid connection. The blue strip is to the left. A solid horizontal line of color 8 connects the source to the blue strip.\n    *   **Green (Right):** Dashed connection. The green strip is to the right. A dashed horizontal line connects the source to the green strip. Based on the source size (3x3), the dash pattern is \"3 pixels fill, 3 pixels gap\".\n    *   **Red (Top):** Solid connection. The red rectangle is above. A solid vertical line connects the source up to the red rectangle.\n    *   **Yellow (Bottom):** Solid connection. The yellow rectangle is below. A solid vertical line connects the source down to the yellow rectangle.\n\n5.  **Construct the Output Grid:**\n    *   Start with the canvas background (color 9) and existing shapes (Blue, Red, Green, Yellow).\n    *   **Draw Horizontal Lines (Rows 7-9):**\n        *   Left (Solid): Fill cols 3-7 with 8.\n        *   Right (Dashed): Start from col 11. Fill 11-13, Skip 14-16, Fill 17-19, Skip 20.\n    *   **Draw Vertical Lines (Cols 8-10):**\n        *   Up (Solid): Fill rows 3-6 with 8 (connecting Source at row 7 to Red at row 2).\n        *   Down (Solid): Fill rows 10-16 with 8 (connecting Source at row 9 to Yellow at row 17).\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nThe resulting grid is 20 rows high and 24 columns wide, containing the preserved shapes and the new cyan connection structure.\n\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"19\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Thought Process: Solving an ARC Task with Palette-Based Image Manipulation**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I need to figure out how to transform an image based on examples and a test case. The input always has a \"palette\" at the top that seems to give some instructions. My goal is to use that to expand a cyan block into lines, but there are constraints based on the colored regions in the main image.\n\nFirst, I looked at the structure. There's a palette, then a main image. The palette has repeating patterns, and I think it might be encoding some relationships between the colors. The main image has solid color rectangles, and a cyan block is a sort of seed. The output should be the same size, but the cyan lines \"grow\" from the seed, and they also seem to form some kind of maze or divider.\n\nI read the hints. I need to crop the palette, so my main focus is on the main image. The cyan block is the starting point, and I have to use cyan color 8 for expansion lines. The existing rectangles define the boundaries. The new cyan structure has to be a maze partitioning the background.\n\nI studied the examples. Example 1 has a blue left rectangle, a yellow right, and a red bottom. I realized the cyan lines form a bounding box around the other colors. After looking closely at the outputs and the palette, I came up with an idea. The palette might be encoding the directions.\n\nLooking at the palette structure, I assumed it to be directional mapping based on the order of colors in the palette. It seems the palette has directions encoded into the color list. The index of the values, also, seems to control the branching: 0 = Branch, 3 = No Branch. For Ex 1, if the block index is 0, the direction in that same order is Left, Up, Right, Down. I then assumed I can create a main cross from the seed, then add branches at the limits based on the branch logic.\n\nWith this in mind, I then tried to go through the Test Input to construct the answer from the ground up, based on my understanding. It contains red, yellow, blue, and green rectangles. Then I tried to apply the branching logic to the Test Input.\n\nAfter reviewing, it seems my algorithm works to expand the cyan block horizontally and vertically and branch out at the top/bottom as needed. It involves using the palette to determine the branching and creating cyan horizontal and vertical extensions based on the existing rectangles.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, I analyzed the structure of the input and the transformation logic demonstrated in the examples.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Input:**\n*   **Header/Palette:** The top 6 rows (0-5) form a repeating \"palette\" pattern separated by a row of grey (5) pixels. This palette encodes instructions for how the Cyan (8) structure should connect to other colored regions.\n*   **Main Canvas:** Rows 6 and below contain the actual puzzle layout. This consists of a background color (often 9 or 3), large rectangular \"obstacle\" regions of various colors, and a central \"seed\" block of Cyan (8) pixels.\n*   **Palette Decoding:** The palette consists of four groups of 4 values (columns between the 5s). Each group corresponds to a cardinal direction (order: Up, Down, Left, Right or similar). Crucially, the **index** of the non-zero color within its 4-value block determines the connection behavior:\n    *   **Index 0 (e.g., `1,0,0,0`):** Indicates a **Branching/Wide Connection**. When the cyan line connects to a rectangle in this direction (or determines the direction is valid), it creates a wide \"plate\" or fill perpendicular to the connection line, extending to the nearest side obstacles.\n    *   **Index 3 (e.g., `0,0,0,3`):** Indicates a **Simple/Narrow Connection**. The connection is just a straight line extending from the seed to the target.\n*   **Test Input Palette:** `1,0,0,0`, `3,0,0,3`, `2,0,0,0`, `4,0,0,0`.\n    *   `1` (Blue) at Index 0.\n    *   `3` (Green) at Index 3.\n    *   `2` (Red) at Index 0.\n    *   `4` (Yellow) at Index 0.\n    *   Mapping to Canvas:\n        *   Red is **Up**. Index 0 implies **Branch**.\n        *   Yellow is **Down**. Index 0 implies **Branch**.\n        *   Blue is **Left**. Index 0. (Horizontal main axis).\n        *   Green is **Right**. Index 3. (Horizontal main axis).\n\n**2. Transformation Logic:**\nThe goal is to grow the Cyan (8) seed into a connected network.\n1.  **Main Cross:**\n    *   **Horizontal:** Extend the rows of the seed (Rows 7-9 relative to canvas start) to the left and right until hitting an obstacle or edge.\n        *   Left: Hits Blue rectangle (Cols 0-2). Fill starts at Col 3.\n        *   Right: Hits Green rectangle (Cols 21-23). Fill ends at Col 20.\n    *   **Vertical:** Extend the columns of the seed (Cols 8-10) up and down until hitting an obstacle.\n        *   Up: Hits Red rectangle (Rows 0-2). Fill starts at Row 3.\n        *   Down: Hits Yellow rectangle (Rows 17-19). Fill ends at Row 16.\n2.  **Branches (Plates):**\n    *   **Top Branch (Up):** Because Red corresponds to Index 0, we create a branch adjacent to it.\n        *   Location: Rows 3-5 (Gap between Red and the main Blue/Green rects).\n        *   Width: Extend left and right until hitting obstacles.\n        *   Left: No Blue rect at these rows (starts Row 6). Extend to Edge (Col 0).\n        *   Right: Green rect exists (Cols 21-23). Extend to Col 20.\n        *   Result: Fill Rows 3-5, Cols 0-20 with 8s.\n    *   **Bottom Branch (Down):** Because Yellow corresponds to Index 0, we create a branch adjacent to it.\n        *   Location: Rows 14-16 (Gap between the main Blue/Green rects and Yellow).\n        *   Width:\n            *   Rows 14-15: Blue rect (Left) and Green rect (Right) exist. Fill Cols 3-20.\n            *   Row 16: Blue and Green rects end at Row 15. The row is clear. Fill Cols 0-23 (Edge to Edge).\n\n**3. Construction Steps:**\n*   Start with the main canvas (Input Rows 6-29).\n*   Preserve existing colored rectangles (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow).\n*   Fill the determined regions with Cyan (8).\n\n**Completed Output

\u201cmain canvas\u201d.\n\n2. **Identify key elements on the main canvas**\n   - **Background color** = the most common color on the main canvas.\n   - **Cyan seed block** = the only small block of color `8`.  \n     Its **bounding box** gives the brush size `(h \u00d7 w)`; in the test it is a **3\u00d73** block.\n\n3. **Treat the cyan block as a sliding \u201cstamp/brush\u201d**\n   - The brush can slide **orthogonally** (up/down/left/right) over **background** cells.\n   - It **cannot overlap** any non-background, non-cyan cells (the large rectangles); those rectangles are preserved.\n   - When the brush slides, **every background cell covered anywhere along the slide** is recolored to cyan (`8`).  \n     (So the painted path has the same thickness as the seed block.)\n\n4. **Which slides are performed (this generates the divider network)**\n   - From the seed position, slide the brush **left, right, up, and down** (a thick \u201ccross\u201d).\n   - From the **right end** of that horizontal slide, also slide **up**.\n   - From the **left end** of that horizontal slide:\n     - test sliding **down**; only if the blocking obstacle (the first thing hit) fully blocks the brush width, go **down**; otherwise go **up**.\n   - Choose a global \u201cturn\u201d direction for extra horizontals:  \n     compare free space from the seed to left vs right border; slide toward the **larger** side (here: **right**).\n   - Whenever a **vertical** slide ends by hitting an obstacle (not by the border), do one extra **horizontal** slide in that global direction.\n   - Whenever such an extra horizontal slide ends by hitting an obstacle, do one extra **up** slide.\n   - (In these grids this stabilizes after a small number of steps.)\n\nApplying this to the test canvas (background `9`, seed is 3\u00d73 at rows 7\u20139, cols 8\u201310), the cyan \u201cwalls\u201d are produced as shown below.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid (main canvas

extend from below any top rectangle to above any bottom rectangle\n- **Boundary vertical lines** connect the horizontal segments:\n  - Left boundary (at the right edge of left rectangles) extends below the seed horizontal to the bottom horizontal\n  - Right boundary (before right rectangles) extends from top to the seed horizontal\n- **Bottom horizontal line** is drawn just above the bottom rectangle, extending to the grid edge\n\nFor the test input:\n- **Rectangles**: Red (rows 0-2, cols 0-20), Green (rows 0-12, cols 21-23), Blue (rows 6-15, cols 0-2), Yellow (rows 17-19, cols 7-15)\n-

I've broken down the pattern based on the examples and I think I've got it. Here's the gist of what's going on:\n\n*   **The Big Picture:** We're given a bunch of input grids and we have to spit out a transformed grid. The transformation seems to focus on an area below a header section. It's like the header tells us what to do with the stuff below it.\n\n*   **Header Decoding:** The header is key. It's got these black boxes with colored bars next to them. The colors in the bars are the important bit. They represent the *targets* of our transformation. I initially thought the position of the bar (left or right) mattered for direction, but that's a dead end. Instead, I believe the *colors themselves* are the crucial pieces.\n\n*   **Finding the Hub:** There's always this area within the grid that is a consistent color (light blue) and kind of stands out. This is the **hub**. It's the central point of the transformation.\n\n*   **The \"Connecting the Dots\" Transformation:** The goal is to draw straight paths from the hub to colored blocks in the main grid section. Straight paths are drawn when an overlap exists (hub row overlaps with target row - horizontal path; hub column overlaps with target column - vertical path). If no overlap, a single dogleg is drawn (primary direction, then a turn). I was initially confused by the \"left/right\" bar and thought it decided \"dogleg or straight\", but it's really the *geometry* of the blocks that decides whether the path is straight or has to jog.\n\n*   **The Header's True Purpose:** The colors in the header boxes act as a sort of list or task list. They tell me which colored blocks in the main area I *must* connect to the hub. If a color is in the header, then a path must connect the hub and the corresponding colored block within the body of the grid. If a color is not present in the body, it is ignored (this explains some pink blocks).\n\n*   **Paths and Obstacles:** The paths are straight or dog-leg. The path fills the space, effectively overwriting background pixels.\n\n*   **Applying the Rules to the Test Input:** So, for the given test input, I need to:\n    1.  Figure out the relevant part of the grid (excluding the header).\n    2.  Find the hub (easy, it's the light blue block).\n    3.  Find all of the target blocks in the grid.\n    4.  Draw paths of the \"hub color\" (light blue) from the hub to the location of the target blocks. Draw paths in the correct horizontal and vertical directions. Overlap is handled by choosing a straight line, otherwise a simple dogleg is drawn.\n\nI've got this. I am now confident that my plan will generate the requested output.\n\n\nThe goal of this task is to generate an output grid based on the provided input grid, following the transformation logic inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Structure of Input**:\n    *   **Header (Rows 0-4)**: Defines the \"targets\" for the transformation. It contains black boxes with colored bars. The colors of these bars represent the specific colored blocks in the main grid that need to be connected.\n    *   **Separator (Row 5)**: A grey line separates the header from the body.\n    *   **Body (Row 6 onwards)**: The main play area containing a \"Hub\" (a block of color 8, usually Light Blue) and several other colored blocks on a background.\n\n2.  **The Transformation**:\n    *   **Grid Resizing**: The output grid consists only of the transformed \"Body\" area. The top 6 rows (Header + Separator) are removed.\n    *   **Connecting Targets**: The core task is to draw lines connecting the central **Hub (Color 8)** to the specific **Target Blocks** identified in the header.\n    *   **Path Properties**:\n        *   **Color**: The paths are drawn using the Hub's color (8).\n        *   **Geometry**: The paths are straight lines (horizontal or vertical) extending from the Hub.\n        *   **Direction**: The direction is determined by the relative position of the Target Block to the Hub (North, South, East, or West).\n        *   **Width/Height**: The path maintains the thickness of the Hub. If the Hub is 3x3, the vertical path is 3 columns wide, and the horizontal path is 3 rows high.\n        *   **Connectivity**: The path extends from the Hub until it touches the Target Block. It overwrites the background but does *not* overwrite the Target Block itself.\n    *   **Targets**: In the test input, the header contains bars of colors **Blue (1)**, **Green (3)**, **Red (2)**, and **Yellow (4)**. Therefore, we must connect the Hub to the blocks of these four colors.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Grid Dimensions**: Input is 30x24. Output will be 24x24 (Rows 6-29 of input).\n*   **Hub Location**: In the output coordinate system (0-indexed), the Hub (Color 8) is a 3x3 block located at **Rows 7-9** and **Cols 8-10**.\n*   **Targets and Connections**:\n    1.  **Red Block (Color 2)**:\n        *   Located at the top (Output Rows 0-2). Spans Cols 0-20.\n        *   **Action**: Draw a vertical path **Up** from the Hub (Cols 8-10) through Rows 3-6 to reach the Red block.\n    2.  **Green Block (Color 3)**:\n        *   Located at the right (Output Rows 0-15). Spans Cols 21-23.\n        *   **Action**: Draw a horizontal path **Right** from the Hub (Rows 7-9) through Cols 11-20 to reach the Green block.\n    3.  **Blue Block (Color 1)**:\n        *   Located at the left (Output Rows 6-15).

The problem involves transforming large grids with some interesting structure \u2013 a header at the top and a main grid with colored blocks. My approach is to treat the header as a sort of wiring diagram and the main grid as the components we need to connect.\n\nHere's my thinking process:\n\n1.  **Grid Setup:** The grid size varies, but there's a clear header separated by a gray line (color 5). The main grid has a background color, which in the examples is green (3).\n\n2.  **The Header is Key:** Each header has boxes, each containing a color bar (left or right side). These seem to define *which* objects in the main grid get linked, and *which direction* to make the connection. I've noticed the numbers inside the black header boxes don't seem to be important to the final solution.\n\n3.  **Example 1 Insights:** In the first example, the header colors are blue, magenta, yellow, and red. The output shows a light blue \"node\" (color 8) that links objects of these colors to one another. Each header \"card\" corresponds to the block of that color on the main grid, and the wire goes in the right direction. The mapping is: Blue (Left), Magenta(Top), Yellow(Right), Red (Bottom).\n\n4.  **Header Color = Object:** The header colors directly tell me which object to connect in the output. The bar's position *inside* the header box seems to map to a direction from the \"node\".\n\n5.  **Bar Position Matters:** \"Left Bar\" could indicate that direction. In the initial example the connection is to the wall if an object of the right color isn't there, and otherwise connects to the object in the correct direction.\n\n6.  **Bar Mapping:** Initially, I assumed the 4 header boxes map to North, East, South, and West. This is consistent with Example 1. Example 2 contradicts this. The bar position seems to affect the mapping, and it varies between the examples.\n\n7.  **Object's Location Trumps Direction:** After reviewing all three examples, I think the *location* of the object is the key, and it does not use a fixed mapping. The header color indicates the target object. A bar at the left side of the header box implies the target object is on the left, etc. The node creates connections in the 4 directions as required. If there is no object in that direction, go to the edge.\n\n8.  **Output Grid Creation:** The output is a modified version of the main grid, but *minus* the last row.\n    \n9.  **Test Input Application:** Now, to apply this understanding to the test case. I will extract the main grid from rows 6-28. I then get the colors from the header. This header tells me to connect Blue to Left, Green to Right, Red to Up, Yellow to Down, from a 3x3 node in the center.\n\n10. **Path Construction:** I locate the target blocks in the grid. Then, I will draw paths (color 8, width 3) from the center to those blocks in those directions. If a block is missing, I draw the path to the wall in the corresponding direction.\n\n11. **Final Output:** The final output is just the modified main grid. I\u2019m confident this strategy will solve the task!\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we need to understand the relationship between the \"header\" (the top section of the grid) and the \"main grid\" (the rest of the grid).\n\n**Observations:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:**\n    *   Each input grid has a header in rows 0-5, separated from the main grid by a grey line (color 5) or implicit boundary.\n    *   The header contains 4 \"boxes\" or slots. Each box displays a specific color and a bar position (left or right).\n    *   The main grid contains a central \"node\" of light blue (color 8) and several rectangular blocks of other colors.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   The goal is to connect the central light blue node (color 8) to specific target objects using paths of color 8.\n    *   The **Header** specifies the **Target Colors** that need to be connected.\n    *   The **Grid Layout** determines the **Direction** of the connection.\n        *   We scan the main grid to find the location of the blocks corresponding to the colors in the header.\n        *   If a target color block is on the **Left** relative to the center, we draw a path to the **Left**.\n        *   If it's on the **Right**, we draw a path to the **Right**.\n        *   If it's on the **Top**, we draw a path to the **Up**.\n        *   If it's on the **Bottom**, we draw a path to the **Down**.\n    *   If a specified color is missing from the grid (like Magenta in Example 1), the path is drawn in the remaining available direction (towards the wall).\n    *   The header contains exactly 4 slots, and there are exactly 4 cardinal directions (Up, Down, Left, Right) from the center. Each slot maps to one direction based on the object's position.\n\n3.  **Details for Path Drawing:**\n    *   The path color is 8 (Light Blue).\n    *   The path width matches the width of the central node (2-wide in examples, 3-wide in the test case).\n    *   The path starts from the center and extends until it hits the target object or the grid boundary.\n    *   The output grid consists of the main grid (rows 6 and below) with the header removed. Additionally, the very last row of the input seems to be dropped in the examples (likely serving as a footer or padding).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Header:**\n    *   The header contains 4 boxes with colors: **Blue (1)**, **Green (3)**, **Red (2)**, **Yellow (4)**.\n    *   We need to connect the center to these 4 colors.\n\n2.  **Analyze Main Grid (Rows 6-29):**\n    *   **Center:** A 3x3 block of 8s is located at Rows 13-15 (relative to the full grid), Columns 8-10.\n    *   **Target Locations:**\n        *   **Blue (1):** Located on the **Left** edge (Cols 0-2, Rows 13-21). -> **Direction: Left**.\n        *   **Green (3):** Located on the **Right** edge (Cols 21-23, Rows 6-18). -> **Direction: Right**.\n        *   **Red (2):** Located at the **Top** (Rows 6-8, Cols 0-20). -> **Direction: Up**.\n        *   **Yellow (4):** Located at the **Bottom** area (Rows 23-25, Cols 7-15). -> **Direction: Down**.\n\n3.  **Construct Paths:**\n    *   **Left Path:** From Center (Cols 8-10) to Blue (Col 2). Draw 8s in Rows 13-15, Columns 3-7.\n    *   **Right Path:** From Center (Cols 8-10) to Green (Col 21).

It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
