My goal here is to crack an ARC task, using examples and a test case.  I need a solid strategy and a logical process. The first thing I do is dig into the examples. I'm looking for patterns, rules, and any visual clues that might reveal the core transformation at play.\n\n*   **Example 1**: I notice color regions, \"noisy\" pixels (color 1), and size differences between the input and output (16x12 -> 12x16). *My first guess is a simple transpose but that doesn't explain the color change*.  I see small regions of different colors contained inside a larger region. It makes me think about \"seeds\", and whether the output is just a tiling or magnification of the 'seeds'. The '1's look like they are separating these regions.\n*   **Example 2:**  Similar features to example 1, but different ratios. There are \"1s\" inside regions. The output colors seem to be the same, which confirms that color is a key piece.\n*   **Examples 3, 4:**  More of the same, though I see the '1's aren't always complete loops. And again the outputs seem to be different colors.\n*   **The common thread:** I notice the frequent appearance of the color '1' (blue). Could this be a special symbol - or it's just the separation point?\n*   **The \"Seed\" Idea:** I explore the concept of \"seeds\" within the regions. The '1's look like boundaries. My current hypothesis is that the output might be zoomed-in version of these \"seeds\", or maybe the input grid is separated into \"tiles\" which are then changed based on the 'seeds'?\n*   **Deeper Dive:** The '1's seem to separate areas. Maybe the color of the output tiles depends on what's next to the tile? *I check if these tiles are just a grid, but the irregular shape is throwing me off*.\n*   **The Inclusions are Key!:**  I start to think that the inclusion is more fundamental than I originally thought. Is this related to Voronoi diagram (divide space in regions according to initial seeds?).\n*   **Color Mapping:** I study what colors are next to '1'. In Example 1, for example, I can see `7, 1, 0, 1, 7`. The output colors might be the neighbors.\n*   **In example 4:** I start seeing that the output is not just a transpose. And I try a logic where a color becomes the neighbor. But, as I analyze it is not consistent. I then decide to focus on the '1's and look at these as boundaries. It looks like it is a \"Flood Fill\". However, that's not the case. I need a more reliable and complete rule.\n*   **The Test Input:** I can see now the pattern. There are nested rectangles. The '1's are \"cracks\" between these nested rectangles or regions.\n*   **I test the theory again and again. Nothing makes sense!**\n*   **The Breakthrough: Transpose & Recolor**. The shape is similar to Example 4. There is no simple geometric relationship between the input and the output (it can't be a transpose, for example). At this point, I try to come up with a formula. And start testing combinations.\n*   **Neighbor via '1'**  I consider the idea that the color of a region is related to colors it's touching. I identify that color flow happens at the '1'. The '1' is the boundary. I am able to explain the first few examples. And try to generalize to make a robust rule.\n*   **Back to the Test Input.** The \"Key Color\" appears. The problem has a logic like this, where colors are swapped. I realize I'm getting close. After many rounds of test and validation. I have my final logic.\n*   **I try a logic where there is an origin for any element of the set.  So I test with Test Input.**\n*   **I consider the test input.** I see a nested configuration, which means there are seeds (the same pixel value or a combination) in the regions.\n*   **And there is a rule.**  The color of the regions depends on the position in the Transposed Matrix.\n*   **I come up with 4 possible models**:  Swap (or Pull) color. Pull or swap color. And in all of them I create a chain with `A | 1 | B`.  \n*   **Final rule:** For each element in the Transposed Input, the\n\nTo solve this task, I analyzed the provided examples to deduce the transformation rules.\n\n**1. Dimensional Transformation:**\nIn Examples 1 and 3, the output grid dimensions are swapped compared to the input (e.g., $16 \\times 12 \\rightarrow 12 \\times 16$). Examples 2 and 4 are square, but the content transformation aligns with this pattern. This indicates the primary geometric transformation is a **Transpose** (rows become columns).\n\n**2. Color Transformation Logic:**\nThe colors in the output are determined by a set of interaction rules mediated by the color **1 (Blue)**, which acts as a boundary, connector, or \"seed\" marker.\n*   **Seed/Container Interaction:** If a region of Color A contains a \"seed\" of Color B (or touches Color B) separated by '1's, the entire region Color A transforms into Color B.\n    *   *Test Input Evidence:* In the test input, we see `0,1,8` (Region 0 contains/touches 8) and `9,1,8` (Region 9 touches 8). This suggests 0 and 9 transform into 8.\n*   **Self-Seeding:** If a region contains '1's surrounded by its own color (e.g., `3,1,3`), it retains its color.\n    *   *Test Input Evidence:* Regions 3 (`3,1,3`), 2 (`2,1,2`), and 6 (`6,1,6`) all exhibit this self-containment pattern, implying they remain 3, 2, and 6 respectively.\n*   **Neighbor Propagation:** Regions adjacent to a transforming region, but lacking '1's themselves, adopt the *original* color of their neighbor.\n    *   *Test Input Evidence:* Region 4 is adjacent to Region 9. Since Region 9 transforms (into 8), Region 4 takes the original color of Region 9. Thus, 4 becomes 9.\n\n**3. Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Region 9 (Outer Frame):** Touches 8 via '1'. Becomes **8**.\n*   **Region 0 (Inner Ring):** Touches 8 via '1'. Becomes **8**.\n*   **Region 8 (Seed/Bottom):** Is the source color. Becomes **8**.\n*   **Region 3 (Middle Ring):** Self-seeded (`3,1,3`). Remains **3**.\n*   **Region 2 (Inner Core):** Self-seeded (`2,1,2`).

The task requires me to analyze a set of input grids with colored regions and \"blue\" (1) markers, then create an output grid that rearranges these regions into specific rectangular blocks. I'm focusing on these blue markers. I believe the blue marker acts like a key, revealing information about the region.\n\nFirst, I examined several examples, paying attention to the colors in the regions and the placement of those markers. The input often presents regions that resemble random noise, but the markers reveal structure. For example, a \"3\" pixel surrounded by \"1\"s in the magenta (6) region from Example 1 creates an association to the output region colored \"3\".  Also, the dimensions can be misleading: the output dimensions might differ from input, suggesting a spatial transformation. I noticed the blue pixels appear to mark a shape.\n\nMy primary hypothesis is that these blue markers function as seeds or keys for constructing the output grid. Each marker will have a color, and possibly a shape, and these parameters define a region. I believe the center of the cross defines the output color for the resulting region. Further, the position of the marker and its relationship to the surrounding colors seem to be important to how I stack the output blocks.\n\nI\u2019m particularly intrigued by the \"missing arm\" of the blue cross. This missing arm looks like a direction which helps position the block. This direction might indicate a \"boundary\".\n\nI am making the most of the relationship between the markers and their surrounding regions.  It's clear that the input regions aren't just shapes but containers, and the markers provide the key to create the output rectangles.  By mapping the input marker positions (x and y) to positions in the output, I\u2019ll be able to create a model for generating the output. My next step will be to extract the shapes and sizes using the parameters from each input grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of colored regions and \"markers\" into a simplified, rectified output grid. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Markers:** In the input grids, there are specific patterns acting as \"markers\". A marker typically consists of a central pixel surrounded by a \"cross\" of pixels (Up, Down, Left, Right) of a contrasting color (often blue/1).\n    *   If the central pixel is a specific color (not the marker arm color), that represents the **Output Block Color**.\n    *   If the central pixel is the same as the marker arms (e.g., 1), the **Output Block Color** is determined by the surrounding region or a neighbor indicated by the \"missing\" arm of the cross.\n\n2.  **Determine Block Layout:** The input grid represents a rough topological map of the output. The output grid is a \"cleaned up\" version composed of rectangular blocks.\n    *   The relative positions of the markers in the input (Top/Bottom, Left/Right) determine the positions of the corresponding blocks in the output.\n    *   The grid is partitioned into strips. A dominant region at the top (like the Maroon 9s in the test input) forms a header. The rest of the grid is split into vertical columns (Left and Right).\n\n3.  **Analyze Test Input:**\n    *   **Top Region:** Maroon (9). Spans roughly rows 0-8.\n    *   **Left Column Markers:**\n        *   Green (3): Located in the upper-left section.\n        *   Teal (8): Located below the Green region (marker found inside the Green region).\n        *   Black (0): Located in the lower-left section.\n        *   Magenta (6): Located at the bottom-left.\n    *   **Right Column Markers:**\n        *   Orange (7): Located in the upper-right section.\n        *   Red (2): Located below the Orange region.\n        *   Yellow (4): Located at the bottom-right.\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   **Grid Size:** 30x30 (inferred from input size and structure preservation).\n    *   **Top Strip (Rows 0-8):** Filled with Maroon (9).\n    *   **Main Body (Rows 9-29):** Split vertically into Left (Cols 0-14) and Right (Cols 15-29).\n    *   **Left Column Stack:**\n        *   **Green (3):** Rows 9-12 (Top of left column).\n        *   **Teal (8):** Rows 13-16 (Below Green).\n        *   **Black (0):** Rows 17-22 (Below Teal).\n        *   **Magenta (6):** Rows 23-29 (Bottom of left column).\n    *   **Right Column Stack:**\n        *   **Orange (7):** Rows 9-16 (Top of right column, spans height of Green+Teal).\n        *   **Red (2):** Rows 17-22 (Below Orange, aligns with Black).\n        *   **Yellow (4):** Rows 23-29 (Bottom of right column, aligns with Magenta).\n\nThis layout respects the topological ordering found in the input markers and regularizes the messy blobs into clean rectangles.\n\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 1>\n<CANDIDATE 2>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n444444444444444444444444444444\n444444999999994444444444444444\n444499999999994444444444444444\n444999999333333344444444444444\n449999933333333333334444444444\n449999333333333333334444999999\n449993103333333313334444999999\n449993333333333111334444999999\n449993333330000333334444999999\n449993333000000033334444999999\n449993333000000033334444999999\n449333333000000033333334999999\n443333333000000033333111991111\n443311133001110033311144999991\n443111133011111033114444999999\n443311133001110033311144998888\n443333333000000033333111998888\n449333333000000033333334888888\n449993333000000033334444888888\n449993333000000033334444888888\n449993333330000333334444888888\n449993333333333111334444888888\n449993103333333313334444888888\n449999333333333333334444888888\n419999933333333333334444888888\n119999999333333344444444888888\n111999999999994444444444888888\n111999999999994444444444888888\n444444444444444444444444888888\n444444444444444444444444888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_1\">\n**Analysis and Solution Strategy for ARC Task**\n\nMy objective is to solve an ARC task that involves transforming input grids of colored blocks into output grids, with the transformation potentially involving transposition and color manipulation. The provided examples suggest that identifying \"seed\" colors, \"container\" colors, and the relationship between them is crucial.\n\nExample 1 demonstrates a potential transpose (swapping rows and columns) along with a color mapping. I notice that \"inner\" colors (found within enclosed regions) are key. The blue pixels (color 1) often act as borders or noise, guiding me to focus on the regular geometric shapes and color adjacency. I believe that a transposed grid represents the output, and I need to determine the color-mapping rule. The key seems to be identifying a color within a container region and mapping that.\n\nExample 2 reinforces the transposition hypothesis. I observe \"seed\" pixels, such as a color isolated within another, can be critical for defining the color substitution. I try mapping the colors by observing the adjacent container colors and its relationship to the isolated \"seed\".\n\nI continue to look for patterns in Example 3 and 4, and try the theory of a ring of colors which shift around.\n\nThrough careful analysis, I've tentatively formulated a solution involving these steps:\n\n1.  **Transpose:** The input grid is transposed, swapping rows and columns.\n2.  **Color Mapping:** A color-mapping function is applied to the transposed grid. The logic of this mapping will be the challenge.\n\nThe proposed logic is:\n\n1. Transpose the input grid.\n2. Map color according to the color of the adjacent container or seed within the container.\n3. Test based on the result.\n\nGiven the time constraint and the complexity of the color-mapping rule, my goal is to generate the Transpose of the grid, applying my best color map. The Color mapping I select is: 9 -> 4, 3 -> 9, 0 -> 3, 2 -> 0, 6 -> 4, 4 -> 4, 8 -> 1, 1 -> 1.\n\n\nThe transformation involves two steps:\n1.  **Transpose** the grid (rows become columns and columns become rows).\n2.  **Remap Colors** based on the containment/adjacency hierarchy observed in the examples.\n\n**Reasoning for Color Mapping:**\nBased on the solved examples, particularly Example 1 and Example 4, there is a cyclic or chain-like shifting of colors between adjacent or concentric regions.\n-   In Example 1: Outer/Left region (6) maps to Neighbor (7). Inner/Middle region (7) maps to Content of Neighbor (3). Side region (4) maps to Content of Neighbor (0).\n-   In Example 4: A cycle exists: 2 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2.\n-   In the Test Input, we see a nested structure:\n    -   Region 9 (Background)\n    -   Region 3 (Inside 9)\n    -   Region 0 (Inside 3)\n    -   Region 2 (Inside 0)\n    -   Region 8 (Inside 9, bottom right) containing 1.\n    -   Regions 6 and 4 (Adjacent to 9).\n\nApplying the \"shift inward/content\" logic:\n-   **9 (Background)** maps to **4** (Color of the significant bottom-right region, similar to Ex 1's 6->7).\n-   **3 (Outer Box)** maps to **9** (Color of its container).\n-   **0 (Middle Box)** maps to **3** (Color of its container).\n-   **2 (Inner Box)** maps to **0** (Color of its container).\n-   **6 (Bottom Left)** maps to **4** (Merges with background/neighbor).\n-   **4 (Bottom Right)** maps to **4** (Self/Stable).\n-   **8 (Inside 9)** maps to **1** (Its content).\n-   **1 (Noise/Boundary)** remains **1** or maps to background **4**? In Ex 1, 1s disappeared. However, 8->1 suggests 1 is a target. Let's map 1->1 in the context of 8, and elsewhere 1s inside regions might merge. Given the density, let's map 1->1.\n\n**Applied Mapping:**\n-   9 -> 4\n-   3 -> 9\n-   0 -> 3\n-   2 -> 0\n-   6 -> 4\n-   4 -> 4\n-   8 -> 1\n-   1 -> 1\n-   7 -> 7 (if present)\n-   5 -> 5 (if present)\n\nThe output grid below is the **Transpose** of the test input, with these color substitutions applied.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,9,9,9,3,1,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,9,9,1,1,1,1\n4,4,3,3,1,1,1,3,3,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,1,1,1,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,1\n4,4,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,3,3,1,1,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,3,3,1,1,1,3,3,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,1,1,1,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,8\n4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,9,9,8,8,8,8\n4,4,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,9,9,9,3,1,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,1,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 2>\n<CANDIDATE 3>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999977999\n999999999993333333333999777799\n999933333333333333333999777799\n999333333333333333333399777799\n993333333333333333333399999999\n993333333333333333333399999994\n933338888888888833333399999944\n933388888888888888888899999444\n933888888888822228888899999444\n933888888822222222228899994444\n933888888222222222222899994444\n933888882222222222222299994444\n933888882222222222222229944444\n666888882222222222222229944444\n666888882222222222222229944444\n666688888888888222222229944444\n666688888888888222222222944444\n666666888888882222222222944444\n666666666666882222222222944444\n666666666666662222222222994444\n666666666666662222222229994444\n666666666666669222222229990044\n666666666666669222222299900044\n666666666666699922229999000044\n666666666669999999999900000000\n666669999999999900000000000000\n999999999999999000000000000000\n999999999999000000000000000000\n999999999999090000000000000000\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **1-markers form cross patterns** that point to special colors embedded within regions\n2. **The pointed-to color and the region color swap**: If region A has a 1-cross pointing to color X (where X belongs to region B), those regions swap colors\n3. **Non-square grids get transposed** (30\u00d730 stays 30\u00d730)\n4. **Regions become regularized rectangles** in the output\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nI found key 1-cross patterns:\n- In the **0 region**: A cross at position (8, 5-7) with center pointing to **8** at position (8,6)\n- In the **8 region**: A cross at positions (27-29, 12-13) with center pointing to **0** at position (28,12)\n\nThis means **0 and 8 swap each other**.

My goal? Figure out how to transform the input into the output. Immediately, I'm struck by the presence of colored regions and these small \"noise\" pixels that look important. I start breaking down the problem by looking at each example and comparing the input and output. The first thing I notice is that the output sometimes has its dimensions flipped, suggesting a potential rotation or transpose operation.\n\nI then try to identify patterns in the content, specifically looking at pixels of value 1, which seem to act as visual markers. Are they borders? Do they define shapes? Are they just randomly distributed? I look closely at the \"1\" pixels in each example, trying to connect their position with what's in the output. I also keep a close eye on the colors \u2013 are they changing, or are they consistent across the examples?\n\nA key hypothesis emerges: is it something about extracting sub-grids defined by the \"1\" pixels? Or, are the \"1\" pixels defining the corners or centers of the regions to be extracted? I dig deep, trying to trace the \"1\" pixels in relation to the colored regions. In one example, the \"1\" pixels seem to enclose a small cluster of pixels. But this doesn't fully explain it.\n\nI then consider the possibility of a pixel-by-pixel transformation but quickly rule it out. So, I start looking for how the input shapes are represented in the output, and I consider if regions are being transformed into individual pixels.\n\nThe idea of the \"1\" pixels as a border or a frame comes to mind, almost like a \"room layout.\" Perhaps the input is a map of the output. I start considering how the output relates to the arrangement of the color in the input. Is the \"1\" pixel defining a container, with the input background color as a seed? Is there a coordinate system or simple Transpose? I try to combine these hypotheses.\n\nAfter some mental gymnastics, I start to realize the output doesn't seem to be a direct transpose or rotation. Instead, I think about this mini-map concept, but again, nothing conclusive. Then, I consider the relationship between the background colors and these little \"seeds\" within the framed \"1\" regions. Could the \u201c1\u201d pixels represent the grid lines of the *Output* image, drawn on the *Input* image?\n\nAt this stage, I decide to try applying the color swap to Example 4, and suddenly, I see a pattern! I've been approaching this too linearly. I notice that rotating the input creates the output pattern! This leads me to believe the input is being rotated 90 degrees clockwise and then colored differently. The \"1\"s start to represent the mapping of how the color should be treated. I revisit all the previous examples, using this new hypothesis of rotation and color remapping.\n\nSo, I start identifying the \"target colors\" that are in the input and output. I start looking for relationships between the colors based on their geometric positions relative to the \"1\" pixels. After much deliberation, the rotation is verified. The \"1\" pixels still factor in, as the output color is based on the colors adjacent to the \"1\".\n\nIn the test input, I try a \"Cut and Paste\" approach. I mentally rotate and try to identify features based on the color. I look for the color mapping. I notice the color swap. For this problem, I conclude there is a 90-degree clockwise rotation, coupled with color transformation.\n\nI can make a mapping of input colors to output colors (example: 9 -> 3).\n\nSo, the \"Final Plan\":\n1.  Rotate 90 Degrees Clockwise.\n2.  Apply Color Mapping. (9->3, 0->8, 6->0, 4->8, and likely 2->2, but I'm unsure of what 8 maps to)\n   \nI\u2019m ready to create the final grid. I consider the specific dimensions, remembering how regions are transformed. Using all this knowledge, I can simulate the transformation mentally!\n\nThe final Output Grid (30x30):\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,\n\nThe transformation involves two steps:\n1.  **Clockwise Rotation:** The grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n    *   The Input dimensions (30x30) result in an Output of (30x30).\n    *   Top-Left (9s) moves to Top-Right.\n    *   Bottom-Left (6s) moves to Top-Left.\n    *   Center (2s) rotates but stays in the center.\n    *   Top-Right (9s/4s) moves to Bottom-Right.\n    *   Bottom-Right (4s/8s) moves to Bottom-Left.\n\n2.  **Color Mapping:** The colors of the large regions change based on \"seeds\" found inside those regions in the input. The seeds are identified by a specific pattern involving the color `1`.\n    *   **Input 9s -> Output 3s:** In the 9-region (top), the pattern `3,1,3` (1 surrounded by 3s) is found.\n    *   **Input 6s -> Output 0s:** In the 6-region (bottom-left), the pattern `0,1,0` is found.\n    *   **Input 2s -> Output 2s:** In the 2-region (center), the pattern `2,1,2` is found.\n    *   **Input 4s -> Output 8s:** In the 4-region (bottom-right side), the pattern `8,1,8` is found.\n    *   **Input 8s -> Output 0s:** In the 8-region (bottom tip), the pattern `0,1,8` (and `1,9,8`) suggests a mapping to 0 (or possibly 9, but 0 fits the geometry of Ex 1 where 8->0). Also, the 8s are adjacent to 4s (which become 8s) and 0s (which become 8s? No, 0 maps to 8). Wait, Input 0 region maps to 8. The Input 8 region is distinct. Given the bottom-left of output is 0s (from input 6s), and the bottom-right of output contains 8s (from input 4s), the tip (input 8s) which rotates to the bottom-left corner of the 8-block likely becomes 0s to match the adjacent 0-block or stays distinct. Based on the pattern `0,1,8` inside the 8-block, and the 6->0 mapping, I will map **8 -> 0**.\n\n**Constructed Grid Segments:**\n*   **Rows 0-12:** Derived from Input Cols 0-12. These columns contain 6s at the bottom (becoming 0s on the left) and 9s at the top (becoming 3s on the right).\n    *   Pattern: 16 `0`s, 14 `3`s.\n*   **Rows 13-22:** Derived from Input Cols 13-22. These columns contain 9s (top), 2s (middle), and 9s (bottom).\n    *   Pattern: `3` (len 6), `2` (len 15), `3` (len 9).\n*   **Rows 23-26:** Derived from Input Cols 23-26. These columns contain only 9s (and maybe 6s at the very bottom which map to 0? No, row 29 is 9s here).\n    *   Pattern: All `3`s.\n*   **Rows 27-29:** Derived from Input Cols 27-29. These columns contain 8s (bottom), 4s (middle), 9s (top).\n    *   Left part (from Input 8s): `0`s (len 4).\n    *   Middle part (from Input 4s): `8`s (len increases from 18 to 20).\n    *   Right part (from Input 9s): `3`s (remaining).\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 4>\n<CANDIDATE 5>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999977999\n999999999993333333333999777799\n999933333333333333333999777799\n999333333333333333333399777799\n993333333333333333333399999999\n993333333333333333333399999994\n933338888888888833333399999944\n933388888888888888888899999444\n933888888888822228888899999444\n933888888822222222228899994444\n933888888222222222222899994444\n933888882222222222222299994444\n933888882222222222222229944444\n666888882222222222222229944444\n666888882222222222222229944444\n666688888888888222222229944444\n666688888888888222222222944444\n666666888888882222222222944444\n666666666666882222222222944444\n666666666666662222222222994444\n666666666666662222222229994444\n666666666666669222222229990044\n666666666666669222222299900044\n666666666666699922229999000044\n666666666669999999999900000000\n666669999999999900000000000000\n999999999999099000000000000000\n999999999999000000000000000000\n999999999999090000000000000000\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_1\">\nLooking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1.

Marker values appear prominently in the output\n\nFor the test input, I identify:\n- A cross with marker **8** at position (8,6) in the 0-region, pointing upward toward the 3-region\n- A cross with marker **0** at position (28,12) at the 9/8 boundary, pointing toward the 8-region\n- Additional crosses connecting other regions\n\nThe color transformations derived:\n- 0 \u2192 8 (region contains marker 8)\n- 8 \u2192 0 (pointed to by marker 0)\n- 3 \u2192 0 (pointed to by cross from 0-region)\n- 2 \u2192 6 (pointed to by cross from 6-region)\n- 4 \u2192 9 (pointed to by cross from 9/4 boundary)\n- 6 \u2192 6 (no incoming cross)\n- 9 \u2192 9 (background)\n- 7 \u2192 7 (no incoming cross)\n\nThe 1s are removed as they represent the cross patterns, not actual regions.\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,0,0,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,0,0,0,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 10>\n<CANDIDATE 11>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n333333333333333333333333777744\n333333333333333333333333777744\n333333333333333333333333777744\n333333333333333333333333777744\n333333333333333333333333777744\n333338888888888888888833333344\n333388888888888888888833333444\n333888888888888888888833333444\n333888888888822228888833333444\n333888888822222222228833334444\n333888888222222222222833334444\n333888882222222222222233334444\n333888882222222222222233334444\n666888882222222222222223344444\n666888882222222222222223344444\n666888882222222222222223344444\n666688888888888222222223344444\n666688888888888222222222344444\n666666888888882222222222344444\n666666666666882222222222344444\n666666666666862222222222334444\n666666666666662222222223334444\n666666666666663222222223330044\n666666666666663222222233300044\n666666666666633322223333000044\n666666666663333333333300000000\n666663333333333300000000000000\n333333333333333000000000000000\n333333333333000000000000000000\n333333333333000000000000000000\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **1-markers form cross patterns** that point to special colors embedded within regions\n2. **The pointed-to color and the region color swap**: If region A has a 1-cross pointing to color X (where X belongs to region B), those regions swap colors\n3. **Non-square grids get transposed** (30\u00d730 stays 30\u00d730)\n4. **Regions become regularized rectangles** in the output\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nI found key 1-cross patterns:\n- In the **0 region**: A cross at position (8, 5-7) with center pointing to **8** at position (8,6)\n- In the **8 region**: A cross at positions (27-29, 12-13) with center pointing to **0** at position (28,12)\n\nThis means **0 and 8 swap each other**.

The prompt is a bit convoluted, trying to mess with my thought process, but the core task is clear: solve the puzzle. I'm going to set aside the prompt engineering stuff and focus on the task.\n\nI'm starting by carefully reviewing the provided examples, especially the input and output grids. I'm checking dimensions (rows and columns), color usage, and how the regions of color seem to relate. I am carefully re-reading the prompts and the instructions, as there are conflicting statements.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the solution involves some form of region coloring based on the color's internal structure or topology of blue \"1\"s. My initial observations suggest a pattern where regions are divided and a special \"Blue\" color (\"1\") serves as the connective structure, as well as the delimiter of sorts. I am trying to figure out if the blue lines define the region, are a feature inside the region, or both.\n\nI'm looking for \"seeds,\" which I define as small areas of a color that seem to be \"inside\" a larger, distinct region of color. I'm also carefully checking any relationships between the input regions and the output regions. Is there a simple mapping or does the mapping depend on some internal feature, such as the number of seed pixels, the seed color, or neighbor relation?\n\nI'm thinking about how the example input regions are transformed into output regions. It seems like the output shapes are simpler, more rectangular than the inputs. One possible strategy seems to be recoloring based on connected regions or seed colors. The examples suggest: Identify a \"seed,\" connect the region via \"1\" network, and then the connected neighbors get the seed color? Another approach is to have a one to one map or remapping the existing colors by analyzing their neighboring regions.\n\nI'm also looking at the examples and exploring whether the task is based on filling regions or some form of color propagation along a network or connections. I'm noting and cataloging relationships like: \"If a region has a seed, do the output blocks of the same color contain the same pixels as the seed?\"\n\nI'm looking at how all of these colors are \"connected\" using the blue \"1\" pixels. Are they acting like a boundary? Are these \"1\" pixels defining the path of color assignment? I am noting patterns to solve this task, it seems like the task can be solved by checking the properties of the adjacent color and seed assignment strategy.\n\nI have found a connection between the Input and Output: it is based on the relationships of seeds and neighbors in the regions. Here is the rule: for each region, if it contains a non-blue seed, and it does not touch another region via the blue, the input should be converted to that color.\n\nBased on the seed's topology and the structure of \"1\" pixels, I'm analyzing the neighbors of each region and the seed relationships. I'm looking at any \"1\" connections and the relationships in the colors. I am checking the connectivity of colors via \"1\" and if they have any seeds or color relations. The rule seems to be: Identify a region with or without seed, and see its neighbors. If it has neighbors connected by \"1\" pixels, then transform this region color to that of the seeds in the adjacent region. I am trying to formalize it with a more structured approach and use a chain of thought to provide a robust solution.\n\nApplying this logic to the provided test input, I am identifying the regions and the blue \"1\" connections. I'm carefully checking the inputs and seed locations and the connections between them. If one region \"contains\" an adjacent region, and is connected to a seed via \"1\", that seed will determine the output. I am looking for nested/connected regions in the test input. From the blue \"1\" connectivity analysis, I'm checking the flow of information: how each region should be colored? I am assigning the seeds to its neighbors, and assigning the output based on that assignment, along with the logic of region connections. I'm looking for a pattern, which may define this transformation in the test input. I'm carefully tracking the transfer of information. I'm looking at the results and trying to find the connection between the current test input, and the examples. It looks like the same approach should work.\n\nI'm following these transformations across the different regions. Each region will be transformed to another color based on the connections. I am looking into \"Outer-Inner\" relationships and how the seed colors transfer. I am using all of my knowledge, and trying to simplify the regions to see what information can be derived from the existing output grids. I'm checking for the \"Inner\" and \"Outer\" regions.\n\nBased on the final solution grid, the output will have\n\nThe solution involves analyzing the connectivity and containment hierarchy of the colored regions, identifying \"seeds\" (single pixels of a different color) within them, and flowing these properties through the network formed by the blue (1) lines.\n\n**Logic Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Object Decomposition**: The input grid consists of several large colored regions (Background 9, Regions 3, 0, 2, 6, 7, 4, 8). Running through these regions is a \"skeleton\" or network of Blue (1) pixels, which connects them topologically.\n2.  **Seed Identification**: Within the regions, we identify \"Seeds\"\u2014pixels of a different color that act as the source of a new color value.\n    *   **Region 0 (Black)** contains a **Seed 8 (Teal)**.\n    *   **Region 2 (Red)** contains a **Seed 9 (Maroon)**.\n    *   **Region 6 (Magenta)** contains a **Seed 0 (Black)** (treated as a \"weak\" seed or placeholder).\n    *   Other regions (3, 7, 4, 9, 8) do not contain distinct strong seeds or are \"Receivers\".\n3.  **Interaction Rule**: The transformation propagates colors between connected regions based on a Source-Receiver relationship:\n    *   **Source (Has Seed)** vs **Receiver (No Seed)**:\n        *   The **Receiver** takes the color of the **Source's Seed**.\n        *   The **Source** takes the color of the **Receiver's Region**.\n    *   **Source (Strong Seed)** vs **Source (Weak Seed)**:\n        *   The **Weak** side acts as a Receiver, taking the **Strong Seed**.\n        *   The **Strong** side takes the **Weak Region's color**.\n4.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   **Chain 1 (0-3-9):**\n        *   **Region 0** (Has Seed 8) connects to **Region 3** (No Seed).\n            *   Region 3 takes Seed 8 $\\rightarrow$ **Becomes 8**.\n            *   Region 0 takes Color 3 $\\rightarrow$ **Becomes 3**.\n        *   **Region 3** (now effectively Seed 8 source) connects to **Region 9** (Background).\n            *   Region 9 takes Seed 8 $\\rightarrow$ **Becomes 8**.\n        *   **Regions 7, 4, 8** connect to Region 9. Since Region 9 becomes 8, these regions also propagate/merge to **8**.\n    *   **Chain 2 (2-6):**\n        *   **Region 2** (Has Seed 9) connects to **Region 6** (Has Weak Seed 0).\n            *   Region 6 (Weak) takes Seed 9 $\\rightarrow$ **Becomes 9**.\n            *   Region 2 (Strong) takes Color 6 $\\rightarrow$ **Becomes 6**.\n        *   **Region 2** is also inside Region 0. Region 0 became 3. The logic holds locally for the 2-6 pair.\n\n**Final Mapping:**\n*   Region 0 $\\rightarrow$ **3**\n*   Region 2 $\\rightarrow$ **6**\n*   Region 6 $\\rightarrow$ **9**\n*   Regions 3, 9, 7, 4, 8 $\\rightarrow$ **8**\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 12>\n<CANDIDATE 13>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999999999\n333333333333333399999999999999\n333333333333333399999999999999\n333333333333333399999999999999\n333333333333333399999999999999\n333333333333333399999999999999\n888888888888888888888888999999\n888888888888888888888888999999\n222222222222222299999999999999\n222222222222222299999999999999\n222222222222222299999999999999\n222222222222222299999999999999\n222222222222222299999999999999\n222222222222222299999999999999\n222222222222222299999999999999\n222222222222222299999999999999\n222222222222222299999999999999\n222222222222222299999999999999\n222222222222222299999999999999\n666666666666666666999999999999\n666666666666666666999999999999\n666666666666666666999999999999\n666666666666666666999999999999\n666666666666666666999999999999\n888999999999999999999999999999\n888999999999999999999999999999\n888999999999999999999999999999\n888999999999999999999999999999\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_5_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n**Here's how I'm thinking about this task:**\n\nI'm being asked to solve an ARC task, using several solved examples and a test case as my guide. The user's prompt is a bit unusual, referencing \"PROTOCOL OVERRIDE\" and \"NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE,\" which makes me suspect they're trying to push the boundaries of what I can reveal. My instructions are to avoid revealing all the intermediate details, but provide enough explanation that someone could understand how I arrived at the solution. I'll prioritize a format of a high-level explanation followed by the grid, as this is the standard for these tasks.\n\nMy initial analysis reveals a transformation happening where the input is a more chaotic, less organized version of the final output. The input has regions of colors and seemingly random markers, mostly represented as \"1\"s. My job is to find the relationship between these input \"features\" and how they map to the neat rectangular outputs.\n\nI start by examining the provided examples. I notice that the input image, compared to the output image, has more colors and is visually noisier, with the 1's as the major culprits. The 1's may be defining the size and location of the rectangles in the output? Also, the input dimension is not a simple transposition of the output (in example 1).\n\nI hypothesize that each region in the input image determines a rectangle in the output, and that those \"1\"s in the input play a crucial role. After going through multiple examples, I deduce that:\n\n*   The 1's in the input, particularly around a marker value, seem to tell me where the boundaries of the output should be (or at least provide coordinates that help in drawing the output rectangle).\n*   The pixel *other* than \"1\" and other backgrounds within a region defines the color to be used in that rectangle of the output. If the input region has the 1s only, the color will be based on background region color.\n\nThe test input is 30x30 with five distinct clusters of 1's plus non-background markers. I decode each cluster to map it to an output. For the first cluster, I determine the center location (14,3). 1's around the background value define an output value of 3. I deduce that the output is composed of rectangular bands, and I try to draw boundaries based on the locations of the non-background pixels, and the Y-locations of non-background values in the Input. I assume a sort-of \"stacking\" of rectangles and use the marker locations as \"breakpoints.\"\n\nMy general rule: Horizontal strips are the basis for constructing the output. Each strip will be either a background color or determined by a non-background value in the Input. The horizontal positioning and Width of a rectangle in the Output will be linked to the X-coordinate of the feature in the Input.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a noisy, segmented input grid into a clean, structured output grid composed of rectangular bands of color.\n\n### **Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The input grids contain large regions of background colors. Within specific rows, there are \"marker\" clusters consisting of a central pixel (defining the color) surrounded by `1`s (blue pixels, defining the geometry).\n2.  **Geometry Mapping (Vertical)**: The input grid can be segmented into horizontal bands based on the Y-coordinates of these markers.\n    *   Scanning from top to bottom, each new marker encountered initiates a new band of color in the output.\n    *   The band continues until the next marker is encountered.\n    *   The rows before the first marker retain the global background color (which is `9` in the test input).\n3.  **Geometry Mapping (Horizontal)**: The width of the colored rectangle in each band is determined by the X-coordinate of the marker.\n    *   The rule inferred from examples is: `Rectangle Width = Grid Width - Marker X Coordinate`.\n    *   The rectangle is aligned to the left (column 0). The remaining columns to the right are filled with the background color (`9`).\n4.  **Parameter Extraction for Test Input**:\n    *   **Global Background**: `9` (from top rows).\n    *   **Marker 1**: Found at `(14, 3)`. Color `3`. Width = $30 - 14 = 16$. Band starts at Row 3.\n    *   **Marker 2**: Found at `(6, 8)`. Color `8`. Width = $30 - 6 = 24$. Band starts at Row 8.\n    *   **Marker 3**: Found at `(14, 10)`. Color `2`. Width = $30 - 14 = 16$. Band starts at Row 10.\n    *   **Marker 4**: Found at `(12, 21)`. Color `6`. Width = $30 - 12 = 18$. Band starts at Row 21.\n    *   **Marker 5**: Found at `(27, 26)`. Color `8`. Width = $30 - 27 = 3$. Band starts at Row 26.\n\n### **Construction Steps**\n\n*   **Rows 0-2**: No markers. Fill with Background `9`.\n*   **Rows 3-7**: Marker `3`. Fill columns 0-15 with `3`, columns 16-29 with `9`.\n*   **Rows 8-9**: Marker `8`.

Regions without arrow patterns may be absorbed or eliminated\n\n**Key observations from examples:**\n- Cross centers become prominent features in output\n- Regions without directional markers (1s) tend to disappear\n- The output creates a clean grid showing spatial relationships between regions\n\n**Test input analysis:**\n- Main regions: 9 (background), 3, 0, 2, 6, 4, 7, 8\n- Cross with center **8** found in region 0 (around rows 7-8, cols 5-6)\n- Cross with center **0** found in region 8 (around row 28, col 12-13)\n- Region 4 has no arrow patterns \u2192 will be eliminated\n- Other regions (3, 2, 6, 7) participate in directional relationships\n\n**Output construction:**\nBased on the spatial relationships from the crosses:\n- 8 (from region 0's cross) represents the upper-middle portion\n- 0 (from region 8's cross) represents the lower area\n- 3, 6, 2, 7 arranged based on their positions relative to the crosses\n- 9 fills background areas\n- 4 removed (no arrows)\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 16>\n<CANDIDATE 17>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n333333333333333333338888844444\n333333333333333333338888844444\n333333333333333333338888844444\n333333333333333333338888844444\n333333333333333333338888844444\n333333333333333333338888844444\n333333333333333333338888844444\n333333333333333333338888844444\n333333333333333333338888844444\n333333333333333333338888844444\n888888888888888888888888844444\n888888888888888888888888844444\n888888888888888888888888844444\n888888888888888888888888844444\n888888888888888888888888844444\n000000000000000000008888844444\n000000000000000000008888844444\n000000000000000000008888844444\n000000000000000000008888844444\n000000000000000000008888844444\n000000000000000000008888844444\n000000000000000000008888844444\n000000000000000000008888844444\n000000000000000000008888844444\n000000000000000000008888844444\n000000000000000000008888844444\n000000000000000000008888844444\n000000000000000000008888844444\n000000000000000000008888844444\n000000000000000000008888844444\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_8_step_5_deep_thinking\">\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation rules:\n\n1. **Finding marked colors**: In each input, certain colors are \"marked\" by being surrounded by 1's in a cross or T-pattern (2-3 adjacent 1's)\n\n2. **Output structure**: The marked colors become prominent features in the output, forming crosses or rectangular regions.

The key here seems to be understanding how regions in the input map to the output.\n\nMy initial thought is that the blue numbers are like clues, maybe marking the borders of regions that need to be grouped somehow. The output seems to be made up of just a few colors from the input, but not all of them, and sometimes the colors get \"remixed\". I'm looking for a way the input is divided to generate the output's colored blocks and which input numbers get \"selected\" or changed. I'm focusing on those blue numbers, what they are connected to, and how they relate to the bigger blocks of color.\n\nAfter looking at multiple examples, I am thinking that those blue numbers show the corners of large, axis-aligned rectangular regions. Each output block color is derived from an input region's color or a special \"seed\" number close to the corner markers. These seeds \"take over\" their own and possibly adjacent regions. I need to test this hypothesis.\n\nFor the final output, I'll need to figure out which input regions are present, what are their \"target colors\", and how they are arranged. I suspect the arrangement is just a simplified version of the input layout. I'm hoping I can take a \"30x30 chunk\" of the input, identify these regions based on the blue numbers' layout and seed colors, and then assemble the output from the identified target colors to arrive at the final solution. The goal is a clear, step-by-step description of the reasoning behind the final grid. I have everything I need, let's solve this!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 30x30 input grid based on the logic inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Markers:** In all examples, blue pixels (value 1) act as \"markers\" or \"noise\" that define the active regions of the grid. These markers are removed in the output. The output consists of clean, axis-aligned rectangular regions.\n2.  **Determine Active Regions & Target Colors:** The input grid contains large noisy regions. We need to identify which regions are preserved and what color they become.\n    *   **Rule:** A region is \"active\" if it contains blue markers.\n    *   **Target Color Rule:**\n        *   If an active region contains a \"seed\" (a small clump of a different color adjacent to or surrounded by the markers), the region takes the color of that seed.\n        *   If an active region contains markers but no distinct seed (only the region's own color surrounds the markers), the region keeps its original color.\n        *   Regions with no markers are effectively \"inactive\" and are overwritten by the expansion of active regions.\n3.  **Apply to Test Input:**\n    *   **Top Region (Rows ~0-6):** Contains a region of 3s with a cross of blue markers. No other seed color is present. **Target: 3.**\n    *   **Middle-Left Region (Rows ~7-16):** Originally color 0. Contains blue markers enclosing a seed of color 8. **Target: 8.**\n    *   **Middle-Right Region (Rows ~7-22):** Originally color 2. Contains blue markers (lines/dots).

The user wants me to solve this ARC task, which is basically about transforming grids of numbers. I have three examples and a test input to work with. The main thing seems to be that we have to figure out a rule for taking an input grid and generating a new, different output grid.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n*   **Inputs are Grids:** It is grids of integers (0-9).\n*   **Outputs are Transformed Grids:** We need to change the grid to be the new output grid.\n*   **The Examples are Crucial:** To get the logic we must figure out the examples!\n\nI've been going through the examples in detail. There are definite patterns, such as:\n\n*   **Colors are Important, maybe?** The numbers 0-9 are essentially colors. And they tend to cluster together in regions.\n*   **Rotation is Involved:** The aspect ratios change between input and output grids. This has to imply a rotation or transpose, or a very odd mapping going on.\n*   **Blue Polygons are Noise:** The blue numbers in the grid (represented by the number '1') seem to define boundaries or a shape. The hints say these are \"noise\" and removed.\n*   **Rectangular Regions:** The outputs are all made up of rectangles of the same numbers (colors).\n\n**Hypotheses and Testing**\n\nMy mind is jumping around, trying different ideas. It's almost certain that the solution involves understanding what those \"Blue\" polygons are, and how that relates to the \"Color\" or \"Region\" identification:\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: Direct Rotation.** Initially, I thought about simply rotating the input grid. I tried 90 degrees clockwise and counter-clockwise and a transpose. The simple rotations didn't directly match the color and shape changes in the examples.\n*   **Hypothesis 2: Region Identification & Transformation.** Maybe the blue polygons define regions. These regions are transformed based on their contents.\n\n**Rotation with a Twist?**\n\nI am starting to believe that a combination of a basic transformation (rotation) and region-based simplification is the way. Let's assume a 90 CW Rotation.\n\n*   Ex 4 is the KEY example, by looking at it, I can see what rotation is happening. The structure of Ex 4 strongly supports it.\n*   The hint is that: \"outputs are simplified into a small number of large axis-aligned rectangular regions\". Let's think about this and rotation. Maybe these rotations are the missing pieces?\n*   It's likely the problem is more complex than simple rotations. But rotation can get us closer, and we may have to account for some color-swapping during the rotation.\n*   Also, the key seems to be identifying the dominant color or number. The output blocks will all be the same color, this is what the output grid is!\n\n**Final Hypothesis and Construction**\n\nI think I have it now! It\u2019s all about a combination of Rotation and Color Expansion. Let's assume that we rotate the grid 90-degrees clockwise, and then \"fill\" regions in the Rotated grid.\n\nTo be even more concrete:\n\n1.  **Rotate 90 CW:** We are performing a rotation and a transpose.\n2.  **Color Expansion/Mapping:**\n    *   Find the \"blue\" shapes in the *original* grid.\n    *   In the *rotated* grid, these blue lines now create the boundaries of regions.\n    *   Figure out the \"dominant\" color (number) within each *original* region.\n    *   Fill the corresponding *rotated* region with the *dominant* color.\n\nI had to test all the examples to make sure it lined up and make sure I was not confused!\n\n**Applying the Hypothesis to the Test Input**\n\nI'm ready to apply this to the Test Input now. It's 30x30. After rotation it is still 30x30, so its shape does not change. I will rotate it and re-draw a new grid:\n\n1.  **Locate the rotated colors:**\n    *   Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise (the row becomes the column).\n    *   Use the \"blue lines\" to separate.\n    *   The \"blue lines\" determine the region locations and color-fill.\n\n2.  **Identify regions and fill the spaces:**\n    *   Take the dominant values! Fill in each new region.\n\n**Testing and Refinement**\n\nBy using the existing examples, let's look and refine to make sure I am getting the right regions and output values. By testing and re-reading the process, I can construct the new grid\n\nThe transformation involves two main steps:\n1.  **Rotation:** The grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. This changes the orientation of the regions and, in non-square examples, swaps the dimensions.\n2.  **Simplification/Denoising:** The rotated grid is partitioned into large, axis-aligned rectangular regions. The boundaries of these regions correspond to the \"blue polyomino\" lines (value 1) present in the original input.

The core idea is that we are transposing and coloring rectangular regions within a grid, based on marker pixels. Let's get into the details:\n\n1.  **Grid Structure and Transposition:** We have an input grid and we are creating an output grid. The key is in understanding how the grid is broken down into strips and blocks. The *rows* in the input grid are \"vertical strips\" and the *columns* in the input are \"horizontal layers\". Inside each strip, the *vertical* blocks of background color define their dimensions (width and height). The output grid is a transformation. It is the Transpose where `new_c = old_r` and the *bottom to top* input is the *left to right* output.\n\n2.  **Strip and Block Identification:** I must break down the input grid. The key is in defining the strips. We must find the consistent boundaries, where the background colors change within *the *Vertical* layer*. This is the *most crucial* step.\n\n3.  **Color Mapping by Marker**: It's all about how each block is \"colored\". This is the tricky part. Within each block, there are \"markers.\" These markers aren't necessarily simple shapes. Ex 1 had `1`s, `3`s, and `0`s. I must create a *consistent* mapping from each marker to the output grid's color.\n\n4.  **Color Table:** I'm using a mapping table for the different markers and their color values. It's not a perfect direct mapping. It is a bit more complex, based on analyzing existing examples.\n\n    *   For Ex 1:\n        *   Pink BG (6), Marker (3) maps to Black (0).\n        *   Orange BG (7), Marker (0) maps to Green (3).\n        *   Yellow BG (4), Marker (9) maps to Orange (7).\n\n    *   For Ex 4:\n        *   Red (2), Marker (1) maps to Red (2).\n\n    *   For the Test Input (30x30):\n        *   BG (9), Marker (7) maps to Pink (6).\n        *   BG (3), Marker (1) maps to Red (2).\n        *   BG (2), Marker (9) maps to Orange (7).\n        *   BG (4), Marker (8) maps to Maroon (9).\n        *   The Key to solve, it's about the boundary structure and strip.\n\n5.  **Output Construction:** I'm creating the output grid step-by-step. To construct the output:\n    1.  I have my Vertical strips (with varying column widths in output).\n    2.  For each strip I get the width.\n    3.  I start the left most to right most columns.\n\nNow, with this understanding, I can solve the ARC task for any test input!\n\nTo solve this task, I analyzed the provided examples to understand the transformation rules governing the layout and coloring of the grids.\n\n**1. Layout Transformation:**\nThe transformation involves a transposition and reconfiguration of the grid's regions.\n*   **Input Structure:** The input grid is partitioned into **Vertical Strips** (columns). Each vertical strip is further divided into **Blocks** (rows).\n    *   Let the vertical strips be $S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_n$ from Left to Right, with widths $W_1, W_2, \\dots, W_n$.\n    *   Inside a strip $S_i$, let the blocks be $B_{i,1}, B_{i,2}, \\dots, B_{i,m}$ from Top to Bottom, with heights $H_{i,1}, H_{i,2}, \\dots$.\n*   **Output Structure:** The output grid is partitioned into **Horizontal Strips** (rows). Each horizontal strip is further divided into **Blocks** (columns).\n    *   The Input Vertical Strips map to Output Horizontal Strips in reverse order (or rotated). Specifically, the Left-most Input Strip becomes the Bottom-most Output Strip.\n    *   Output Strip $H'_k$ corresponds to Input Strip $S_k$. The height of the output strip equals the width of the input strip ($Height(H'_k) = Width(S_k)$).\n    *   Inside an Output Strip $H'_k$, the Input Blocks $B_{k,1}, B_{k,2}$ map to Output Blocks $B'_{k,1}, B'_{k,2}$ arranged Left to Right.\n    *   The width of the output block equals the height of the input block ($Width(B'_{k,j}) = Height(B_{k,j})$).\n\n**2. Color Transformation:**\nThe color of an output block is determined by a specific \"marker\" found within the corresponding input block. The mapping is consistent across examples:\n*   **Marker Logic:** In each input block, there is a distinct pattern or \"seed\" pixel that differs from the background or forms a center of a shape. This marker determines the output color.\n*   **Mapping Table:**\n    *   Marker **3** (Green) $\\rightarrow$ Output **0** (Black)\n    *   Marker **0** (Black) $\\rightarrow$ Output **3** (Green)\n    *   Marker **1** (Blue) $\\rightarrow$ Output **2** (Red)\n    *   Marker **9** (Maroon) $\\rightarrow$ Output **7** (Orange)\n    *   Marker **7** (Orange) $\\rightarrow$ Output **6** (Pink)\n    *   Marker **8** (Light Blue) $\\rightarrow$ Output **9** (Maroon)\n    *   *Self-mapping seen implied:* Marker 2 $\\rightarrow$ 2? (Not used in final logic but consistent with Ex 4).\n\n**3. Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Dimensions:** Input is 30x30. Output will be 30x30.\n*   **Segmentation of Input:**\n    *   **Strip 1 (Left, Cols 0-3):** Width 4.\n        *   Block Top (Rows 0-14): Marker is **3** (Green). $\\rightarrow$ Output Color **0**.\n

model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_4_step_5_image\">\nLooking at the input-output examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Each input contains distinct colored regions** with some cells containing \"1\" markers that form cross patterns\n2. **The \"1\" markers indicate boundaries** between regions and sometimes contain special \"marker colors\" at their centers\n3. **The output simplifies the grid** into clean rectangular regions\n4. **Key transformation: marker colors expand** - when a different color appears at a cross pattern's center within a region, that color replaces the region\n\nAnalyzing the test input:\n- **9**: Background/border\n- **3** (green): Upper portion, rows ~2-6\n- **0** (black): Middle area, rows ~7-18, has **8** as a marker (at row 8, col 6)\n- **2** (red): Central area, rows ~9-24\n- **6** (orange): Left side, rows ~14-26\n- **4** (yellow): Right side, rows ~6-29, cols ~24-29\n- **8** (blue): Bottom area, rows ~25-29, has **0** as a marker (at row 28, col 12)\n- **7** (cyan): Small region, upper-right (will be absorbed)\n\nThe key transformations:\n- Region 0 \u2192 becomes 8 (because 8 is marked within 0)\n- Region 8 \u2192 becomes 0 (because 0 is marked within 8)\n\nOutput structure (30\u00d730):\n- Top 5 rows: 3 (green) with 4 on right edge\n- Rows 5-11: 6 (left), 8 (middle, transformed from 0), 4 (right)\n- Rows 12-24: 6 (left), 2 (middle), 4 (right)\n- Bottom 5 rows: 0 (transformed from 8), with 4 on right\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_7_step_5_image\">\n**Reflections on Solving an ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here we go. The user wants me to tackle an ARC problem, and the goal is to figure out the rule that transforms a given input grid into its output. I'm focusing on the patterns to crack this. The user wants a summary of the thought process, so here it goes.\n\nFirst things first: The grids are usually pretty big, around 10 to 30 rows and columns, so I need to think systematically. I observe that the input grids are made up of color blocks and there are odd pixels - \"intruder\" pixels of a different color, which look important. I noted Blue pixels often show up on the borders. Let's see if those have any meaning.\n\nI looked at the given examples closely, especially at example 1. In Example 1, I noted: solid colors are used to build up rectangular areas in the input, and blue pixels, and sometimes black, maroon and green, act as \u201cintruders\u201d.\n\nThe output also uses colors, but not all the colors from the input, which is a good clue. Then I looked at the structure - input is a partition of the grid, output is a new partition. I checked if the output grid had changed size. Example 1 is a bit confusing because the output size is the transpose. That suggests rotation or remapping of how things connect.\n\nI started analyzing the topology. I looked at the color regions and if they touch each other. Then I looked at where the odd, single-color pixels - the intruder pixels - are. I made a hypothesis that these intruder pixels are like \"connector\" objects and they may define a new relationship between regions. In Example 1, the output regions look different from the input. It seems the input is rotated. If I rotate it, the regions line up. Okay, it may be a rotation or a transpose.\n\nI had an idea that maybe the \"connector\" shapes define the output regions. Let's check it again. The \"connector\" pixels, I thought, were not random, but form specific shapes like \"T\"-shapes or crosses. In the input, these shapes were different. The shapes, I thought, might be defining the color of the output regions. The hypothesis: \"connector\" shapes are defining new regions or telling me how to color the regions by acting as \"stamps\".\n\nLet's check it. In Example 1, I saw some pixels changed the original color into new one, based on their position near those colored pixels, so the connector could be the source. But this didn't work. I thought that maybe it isn't an adjacency graph, but a transpose! I noticed in Example 1 that the transpose gives a better structure match, and the \"intruder\" pixels might be defining the output colors. So, I need to check the exact rule.\n\nIf I rotate the input, what happens to the colors? Then, for the \"connectors,\" where are the pixels located? For instance, I got a hypothesis: The color of the \"connector\" is the new color of the area it's touching. I check this, but it doesn't always apply, because some markers use a color from an area not next to the marker. I thought to see if the colors are a subset of the Input colors, which turns out they are. The output's color must come from the \"intruder\" shape color, not necessarily from the neighboring colors.\n\nSo, I rethought, that the \"connector shapes\" are not randomly scattered, I have a more defined rule - maybe a \"dual graph\" transformation. And so, I hypothesized again that the grid is transposed and the \"connector\" shapes define the new region's color. Maybe the center color or location is important. The output region colors match specific connector colors! I found that in Example 1, there is a consistent mapping.\n\nI decided to check the Example 2, by looking at connector colors to see if this pattern holds. I can see there are similar connector shapes, so I believe there is an underlying structure, but I need the right perspective. Let's see if it's the 90-degree rotate or the transpose that changes everything, or perhaps it's the underlying relationship.\n\nNow the idea of the \"Flow\" and \"Pipes\" metaphor for connector pixels came to mind. Maybe regions are linked in some way. I have to re-evaluate the Output 1 structure - can the output colors somehow be related to the neighboring regions? Maybe it's not the simple geometric transformation; I've got to consider the color mapping. I need to simplify this, I have an idea to find a simpler pattern.\n\nI was looking at Input 1, specifically the Test Input. It's time to refine the idea, and there is a key observation - Intruder shapes are also used in the output (e.g., they\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation involves two main steps:\n1.  **Geometric Transformation:** The output grid is a **90-degree Clockwise Rotation** of the input grid. This is inferred from Example 1 where the top-right region (Yellow) moves to the top-left, and the top-left region (Pink) moves to the bottom-left. The dimensions verify this: Input `(r, c)` maps to Output `(29-c, r)` for a 30x30 grid.\n\n2.  **Color Transformation:** The regions change color based on specific \"markers\" or \"intruders\" found within them or on their boundaries in the input.\n    *   **Rule:** If a region contains a small shape (marker) of a different color, the region takes the color of the *marker's core* in the output. If there is no distinct marker, it may take the color of a neighbor or a default background mapping.\n    *   **Mapping derivation from Test Input:**\n        *   **Region 3 (Green, Top-Middle):** Contains markers with center **8**. -> New Color **8**.\n        *   **Region 2 (Red, Center):** Contains markers with center **6**. -> New Color **6**.\n        *   **Region 6 (Pink, Bottom-Left):** Contains markers with center **0**. -> New Color **0**.\n        *   **Region 8 (Light Blue, Bottom-Right):** Contains markers with `9`. Neighbor is 4 (Yellow) which becomes 9. -> New Color **9**.\n        *   **Region 4 (Yellow, Right Edge):** Neighbors Background 9. In Example 1, Yellow(4) -> 7 (Neighbor). Here, 9 -> 4. So 4 -> **9**. (Also merges with Region 8).\n        *   **Region 7 (Orange, Top-Right):** Neighbors Background 9. -> New Color **4** (Background).\n        *   **Region 9 (Maroon, Background):** Becomes the fill color. Based on mappings (7->4, 9->4), the new background is **4**.\n\n**Transformation Logic applied to Test Input:**\nFor every cell `(r, c)` in the Input 30x30 grid:\n*   Map the coordinates to `(r', c') = (29-c, r)`.\n*   Map the color `val` at `(r, c)` to `new_val`:\n    *   If `val` is part of Region 3 (Green) or its markers (1, 8, 0 inside): `new_val = 8`.\n    *   If `val` is part of Region 2 (Red) or its markers (1, 6 inside): `new_val = 6`.\n    *   If `val` is part of Region 6 (Pink) or its markers (0, 1 inside): `new_val = 0`.\n    *   If `val` is part of Region 8 (Lt Blue) or its markers (0, 1, 9 inside): `new_val = 9`.\n    *   If `val` is Region 4 (Yellow): `new_val = 9`.\n    *   If `val` is Region 7 (Orange): `new_val = 4`.\n    *   If `val` is Region 9 (Background): `new_val = 4`.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n4,4,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n4,4,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n4,4,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n4,4,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n4,4,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n4,4,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 26>\n<CANDIDATE 27>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n333333333333333333333333333333\n333333333333333333333333399333\n333333333338888888888333999933\n333388888888888888888333999933\n333888888888888888888833999933\n338888888888888888888833333333\n338888888888888888888833333338\n388882222222222288888833333388\n388822222222222222222233333888\n388222222222266662222233333888\n388222222266666666662233338888\n388222222666666666666233338888\n388222226666666666666633338888\n388222226666666666666663388888\n000222226666666666666663388888\n000222226666666666666663388888\n000022222222222666666663388888\n000022222222222666666666388888\n000000222222226666666666388888\n000000000000226666666666388888\n000000000000006666666666338888\n000000000000006666666663338888\n000000000000003666666663330088\n000000000000003666666633300088\n000000000000033366663333000088\n000000000003333333333300000000\n000003333333333300000000000000\n333333333333333000000000000000\n333333333333330000000000000000\n333333333333330000000000000000\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_10_step_5_image\">\n### Observations from the solved examples\n1. The big areas in the input are *regions* (large connected components) of solid color.  \n2. Color **1** is not part of the regions; it forms small **\u201carrow\u201d symbols** embedded inside regions.  \n   - An arrow symbol is detected at a **junction cell** that has **exactly 3 orthogonal neighbors of color 1** (so one of the 4 directions is \u201cmissing\u201d a 1).\n   - The junction cell can be **1** or a **different color**.\n3. **Arrow direction**: if the missing-1 neighbor is, say, \u201cdown\u201d, the arrow points **up** (opposite the missing side).  \n   The arrow always goes through a 1-cell, so the **target** is **2 steps** from the junction in that direction.\n4. **Payload color** (the color \u201csent\u201d by the arrow):\n   - If the junction cell is **not 1**, the payload is that junction color.\n   - If the junction cell **is 1**, the payload is the **region color** it sits in (the only non-1 neighbor at the junction).\n5. Each arrow **recolors the entire target region** with its payload. After recoloring, all arrow pixels (the 1s and any special junction color) are filled with their containing region\u2019s final color (so **no 1 remains**).\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\nIn the test grid there are 8 large regions (colors): **9, 7, 3, 0, 6, 2, 4, 8** and 8 arrows, each pointing into one of these regions. Reading each arrow gives the final recoloring:\n\n- region **9 \u2192 3**\n- region **7 \u2192 9**\n- region **3 \u2192 8**\n- region **0 \u2192 2**\n- region **6 \u2192 0**\n- region **2 \u2192 6**\n- region **4 \u2192 8**\n- region **8 \u2192 0**\n\nThen we repaint the whole grid accordingly, and replace every arrow cell with its region\u2019s final color.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n```text\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,3,3\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,3,3\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,9,9,9,9,3,3\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n3,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,0,0,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,0,0,0,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 27>\n<CANDIDATE 28>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n333333333333333333333333377777\n333333333333333333333333377777\n333333333333333333333333377777\n333333333333333333333333377777\n333333333333333333333333377777\n333333333333333333333333377777\n888888888888222222222222244444\n888888888888222222222222244444\n888888888888222222222222244444\n888888888888222222222222244444\n888888888888222222222222244444\n888888888888222222222222244444\n888888888888222222222222244444\n888888888888222222222222244444\n666666666666222222222222244444\n666666666666222222222222244444\n666666666666222222222222244444\n666666666666222222222222244444\n666666666666222222222222244444\n666666666666222222222222244444\n666666666666222222222222244444\n666666666666222222222222244444\n666666666666222222222222244444\n666666666666222222222222244444\n000000000000888888888888844444\n000000000000888888888888844444\n000000000000888888888888844444\n000000000000888888888888844444\n000000000000888888888888844444\n000000000000888888888888844444\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_11_step_5_image\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify a consistent transformation pattern:\n\n1. **The inputs have colored regions with \"1\" markers forming crack/cross patterns**\n2. **Small \"accent\" colors appear at 1-cross intersections (not the background color, not 1)**\n3. **The output creates clean rectangular regions where:**\n   -

It looks like we're dealing with a grid-based puzzle where the key lies in understanding \"tiles,\" which are essentially solid-color rectangles, and how those rectangles interact with each other via directional \"arrows\" or markers. The goal is to figure out the output based on a series of examples and a test input.\n\nMy initial thought is this: the arrows are the conductors of colored \"payloads\" that move from one tile to another. The direction of the arrow determines the destination, and the tile's base color gets updated based on the payload. Some global rotations/transpositions might be involved.\n\nTo test this, let's dive into Example 1. After carefully examining the 16x12 grid and how it maps to a 12x16 output, I identified the rectangular regions and noticed distinct shapes that seem to be markers. By breaking down the top-left area, it was obvious we had a pattern: a T-shape or a plus-like shape within the \"tiles\" and used this pattern to understand the arrow direction. For each tile, I focused on the color of the central shape, and if it wasn't a one, it was the color that should be used as a payload. If the center was one, the base tile color was used. In Example 1, the transformation seemed to involve a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation because the output was the reverse of the input.\n\nMy focus shifted to identifying and mapping tiles, the payloads, and the impact of the arrows. I'm hypothesizing that the arrow pattern points in a specific direction (usually away from a vertical bar), and a color will get transferred. The puzzle involves calculating the final color of each tile.\n\nFor Example 1, I noticed something strange: the payload and the base color of the tile impacted the output. If two tiles merge, the color will transfer. I tried to generalize the rules, looking for patterns when tiles were modified in color. I carefully mapped out how colors propagated through the grid. The direction seems to be towards the \"missing\" side of the marker.\n\nAfter meticulously analyzing example 1, I shifted to a more general strategy:\n- Segmentation of a grid into tiles.\n- Identify the marker's structure.\n- Determine arrow payload based on arrow color.\n- Predict the transformations.\n\nI started applying this approach to a much larger test grid (30x30). The large grid made the previous analysis useful. I carefully identified a strategy to decompose the big test input into tiles. The test input had markers inside nested tiles. This was more complex, requiring multiple passes of understanding where colors spread.\n\nMy thought process then included the use of graphs and more sophisticated reasoning to understand how colors flowed within tiles. This required a new level of pattern-matching and generalization. The process took into account overlapping tiles and multiple arrow interactions. The final state was defined by the arrows and the flow of the colors.\n\nThe implementation details became crucial. I figured out a way to model the solution and predict the changes that happened.\n\n\nThe logic for determining the transformation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Segmentation**: The grid is segmented into rectangular regions of solid base colors. Small \"noise\" or interior details are ignored to determine the base color.\n2.  **Marker Detection**: \"Markers\" are patterns of `1`s (and sometimes a center pixel of another color) found within these regions. They act as directional arrows.\n    *   A \"T\" shape points in the direction of the \"missing\" arm (or away from the crossbar/towards the stem).\n        *   `|-` (vertical bar left, protrusion right) points **Right**.\n        *   `-|` (vertical bar right, protrusion left) points **Left**.\n        *   `_|_` (inverted T) points **Up**.\n        *   `T` (standard T) points **Down**.\n    *   A \"+\" (Plus) shape points in **All 4 Directions**.\n3.  **Payload Determination**:\n    *   If the center of the marker is `1`, the payload is the **Base Color** of the tile containing the marker.\n    *   If the center of the marker is NOT `1`, that center color is the payload.\n4.  **Interaction**:\n    *   The payload is \"fired\" into the adjacent tile(s) in the indicated direction(s).\n    *   The target tile changes its color to the payload color.\n    *   This can cause a chain reaction or simultaneous updates. (e.g., A targets B, B targets C).\n    *   In the test input, we have:\n        *   **Tile C (3s)**: Marker (Up) -> Payload 3 -> Targets **Top 9s**. Top 9s become **3**.\n        *   **Tile D/G (0s)**: Marker (Plus) -> Payload 0 -> Targets **Tile E (2s)** and **Tile F (6s)**. E and F become **0**.\n        *   **Tile E (2s)**: Marker (Up) -> Payload 2 -> Targets **Tile D (0s)**. D becomes **2**.\n        *   **Tile 9 (8s)**: Marker (Plus) -> Payload 8 -> Targets neighbors (**4s**, **Right/Bottom 9s**). They become **8**.\n        *   **Tile B (7s)**: No incoming, no outgoing. Stays **7**.\n        *   **Tile Left 9s**: No incoming.

First, I try to understand the core logic by looking at the problem description and examples. It seems like the inputs are composed of tiles with a main color and maybe some \"marker\" patterns in a contrasting color. These markers are critical because they seem to indicate a direction. The directional marker points to a neighboring tile. The direction is determined by the specific shape or position of the marker inside the tile. The \"Head\" or missing edge of the shape gives us the direction. A key point is that the marker triggers actions: a color transfer to the targeted neighbor.\n\nI carefully examine the examples, paying attention to the input and output. I check the dimensions and look for any transpositions or rotations. It seems that there are two distinct types of marker rules that can exist. One has the \"head\" pointing to the target cell (similar to an arrow), and the other has a \"missing edge\" of the shape telling the cell where to move to.\n\nIn Example 1, I worked out the marker shapes. One rule had the arrow pointing down, indicating the neighbor cell should be changed to the center cell color.\n\nI then built a hypothesis. 1) Segment the input grid into the main tiles. 2) I identify all markers and determine their directions. 3)  Based on the direction, find the neighboring tile and decide the action, which usually involves changing the neighbor's color. Then I construct the output by modifying tiles.\n\nThe problem got tricky in Example 1. I had trouble with the meaning of the markers and if the direction pointed to the target. It seems like the \"Head\" means the color is moved there. The Head of the Marker shape points in the direction of the arrow. This means 3 things: a) Marker Location, b) Color, and c) Direction, which must be interpreted to make a successful solution.\n\nIn the Test Input, I got a bit of an idea. It seems like the action is to find a boundary tile and change its color to match the marker's shape color. The process is to first find solid-colored tiles and make a grid. Then I will identify the tile borders and marker regions. I carefully identify these to get a solid direction for all actions. I will carefully identify the regions and make sure there are no other internal markers that may disrupt the solution.\n\nUltimately, I needed to check and recheck my rules against the examples to make sure they were consistently giving me the correct answers. Once I've verified the rules, I can apply them to the Test Input.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of colored tiles based on \"arrow\" markers formed by the color `1`. The transformation involves identifying these markers, determining the direction they point, and moving a payload color to the adjacent tile in that direction. The grid is then segmented and filled with the final colors.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution Logic:**\n\n1.  **Segmentation:**\n    The grid is composed of rectangular regions (tiles) of solid colors (ignoring small internal details). We identify these tiles in the Input:\n    -   **Tile A (Top Background):** Color `9`. Covers the top/left surrounding area.\n    -   **Tile B (Top-Center):** Color `3`. Large rectangular block inside the top `9` area.\n    -   **Tile C (Top-Right):** Color `7`. Small block in the top right corner.\n    -   **Tile D (Bottom-Left):** Color `6`. Block on the mid-to-bottom left.\n    -   **Tile E (Bottom-Center):** Color `2`. Block to the right of Tile D.\n    -   **Tile F (Right Strip):** Color `4`. Vertical strip on the right edge.\n    -   **Tile G (Bottom-Right):** Color `8`. Block in the bottom right corner.\n    -   **Tile H (Bottom Background):** Color `9`. Strip at the very bottom, below D, E, G.\n\n2.  **Marker Detection & Direction:**\n    Markers are patterns of `1`s centered around a pixel. The direction is determined by the \"head\" of the pattern (the side with a single pixel, or opposite the missing side of the cross).\n    -   **In Tile B (Color 3):** There is a marker at the top `(Row 2-3)`. The pattern has `1`s at Top, Left, Right relative to the center `1`. This shape corresponds to an arrow pointing **Up**.\n        -   **Action:** Tile B points to its neighbor above, **Tile A**.\n        -   **Payload:** Center is `1`, so payload is the tile's base color **3**.\n    -   **In Tile E (Color 2):** There are two markers.\n        1.  Top marker `(Row 9-10)`: `1`s at Top, Left, Right. Points **Up**.\n            -   **Action:** Tile E points to its neighbor above, **Tile B**.\n            -   **Payload:** Base color **2**.\n        2.  Left marker `(Row 20-22)`: `1`s at Top, Right, Bottom. Points **Left**.\n            -   **Action:** Tile E points to its neighbor to the left, **Tile D**.\n            -   **Payload:** Base color **2**.\n    -   **In Tile D (Color 6):** Marker at `(Row 17-18)`. `1`s at Left, Right, Bottom. Points **Down**.\n        -   **Action:** Tile D points to its neighbor below, **Tile H**.\n        -   **Payload:** Base color **6**.\n    -   **Other Tiles (A, C, F, G, H):** No valid directional markers found.\n\n3.  **Applying Transformations:**\n    -   **Tile A** receives color **3** from Tile B. (Old 9 -> New 3).\n    -   **Tile B** receives color **2** from Tile E. (Old 3 -> New 2).\n    -   **Tile D** receives color **2** from Tile E. (Old 6 -> New 2).\n    -   **Tile H** receives color **6** from Tile D. (Old 9 -> New 6).\n    -   **Tile E** has no incoming arrows, so it remains **2**.\n    -   **Tile C** remains **7**.\n    -   **Tile F** remains **4**.\n    -   **Tile G** remains **8**.\n\n4.  **Final Cleanup:**\n    -   Remove markers and fill tiles with their new colors.\n    -   Merge adjacent tiles of the same color (Tile B, D, E all become 2, forming a large central region).\n\n5.  **Global Transformation:**\n    -   Check input dimensions. The test input is square (30x30), so no global transpose is needed (consistent with Example 2 and 4).\n\n**Final Color Mapping:**\n-   Top area (was 9) -> **3**\n-   Top-Right (was 7) -> **7**\n-   Middle/Center area (was 3) -> **2**\n-   Bottom-Left (was 6) -> **2**\n-   Bottom-Center (was 2) -> **2**\n-   Right Edge (was 4) -> **4**\n-   Bottom-Right (was 8) -> **8**\n-   Bottom Edge (was 9) -> **6**\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,8,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,8,8,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

Replace all cells with their tile's final color\n\n**Identifying tiles and arrows in the test input:**\n\nMain tiles:\n- **9** (maroon): Background\n- **3** (green): Upper interior region\n- **0** (black): Middle-left interior  \n- **2** (red): Central region\n- **6** (magenta): Lower-left\n- **4** (yellow): Right side\n- **7** (orange): Small upper-right area\n- **8** (azure): Lower-right\n\n**Arrows and their effects:**\n1. In 3-tile (rows 2-3): downward arrow \u2192 3 goes to 0-tile\n2. In 9-tile (rows 5-6): upward arrow \u2192 9 goes to 7-tile\n3. In 0-tile (rows 7-8): plus with center **8** \u2192 8 goes to 3-tile\n4. In 2-tile (rows 9-10): upward arrow \u2192 2 goes to 0-tile\n5. In 0-tile (rows 17-18): downward arrow \u2192 0 goes to 6-tile\n6. In 6-tile (rows 20-22): rightward arrow \u2192 6 goes to 2-tile\n7. In 8-tile (rows 25-26): upward arrow \u2192 8 goes to 4-tile\n8. In 9/8 boundary (rows 27-29): rightward arrow with center **0** \u2192 0 goes to 8-tile\n\n**Final color mappings:**\n- 3 \u2192 8, 0 \u2192 2, 2 \u2192 6, 6 \u2192 0, 4 \u2192 8, 7 \u2192 9, 8 \u2192 0, 9 \u2192 9\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n9,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,0,0,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,0,0,0,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 34>\n<CANDIDATE 35>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999977999\n999999999998888888888999777799\n999988888888888888888999777799\n999888888888888888888899777799\n998888888888888888888899979999\n998888888888888888888899777997\n988883333333333388888899999977\n988833333333333333333399999777\n988333333333366663333399999777\n988333333366666666663399997777\n988333333666666666666399997777\n988333336666666666666699997777\n988333336666666666666669977777\n000333336666666666666669977777\n000333336666666666666669977777\n000033333333333666666669977777\n000033333333333666666666977777\n000000333333336666666666977777\n000000000000336666666666977777\n000000000000006666666666997777\n000000000000006666666669997777\n000000000000009666666669990077\n000000000000009666666699900077\n000000000000099966669999000077\n000000000009999999999900000000\n000009999999999900000000000000\n999999999999999000000000000000\n999999999999990000000000000000\n999999999999990000000000000000\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_18_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n1.

Else, preserve color.\"\n- *Constraint:* If the reasoning is incoherent or vague, mark the Candidate as \"INVALID - VAGUE\".\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT (CRITICAL)\n- You must \"Back-Test\" the Crystallized Rule against the {{SOLVED_EXAMPLES}}.\n- For **EACH** Solved Example pair (Input -> Output), you must strictly perform this 3-step check:\n  1. **Hypothesis:** \"If I apply the Candidate's Rule to this Input, exactly what *should* happen?\"\n  2. **Observation:** \"Look at the actual Official Output. What *actually* happened?\"\n  3. **Verdict:** \"Do they match?\"\n- **Fatal Contradictions to Watch For:**\n  * **Scope Error:** Rule applies to specific colors (e.g., \"Blue\"), but the example changes \"Red\" pixels.\n  * **Geometry Error:** Rule says \"rotate 90,\" but example shows a flip.\n  * **Object Error:** Rule treats pixels individually, but example shows objects moving as blocks.\n- *Constraint:* Record exactly how many Solved Examples the candidate PASSED vs FAILED. **Do not stop at the first failure**; check all examples to determine the severity of the failure (e.g., \"Passed 2/3 Examples\").\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n- For Candidates that survived Phase 2 (or passed at least one example):\n- Look at the {{TEST_INPUT}} and the Candidate's <PROPOSED_SOLUTION> grid.\n- Does the proposed output actually follow the Crystallized Rule?\n- *Common Hallucination:* The text says \"Move Blue,\" but the grid shows Blue staying still.

down. My goal here is to crack an ARC task, using examples and a test case.  I need a solid strategy and a logical process. The first thing I do is dig into the examples. I'm looking for patterns, rules, and any visual clues that might reveal the core transformation at play.\n\n*   **Example 1**: I notice color regions, \"noisy\" pixels (color 1), and size differences between the input and output (16x12 -> 12x16). *My first guess is a simple transpose but that doesn't explain the color change*.  I see small regions of different colors contained inside a larger region. It makes me think about \"seeds\", and whether the output is just a tiling or magnification of the 'seeds'. The '1's look like they are separating these regions.\n*   **Example 2:**  Similar features to example 1, but different ratios. There are \"1s\" inside regions. The output colors seem to be the same, which confirms that color is a key piece.\n*   **Examples 3, 4:**  More of the same, though I see the '1's aren't always complete loops. And again the outputs seem to be different colors.\n*   **The common thread:** I notice the frequent appearance of the color '1' (blue). Could this be a special symbol - or it's just the separation point?\n*   **The \"Seed\" Idea:** I explore the concept of \"seeds\" within the regions. The '1's look like boundaries. My current hypothesis is that the output might be zoomed-in version of these \"seeds\", or maybe the input grid is separated into \"tiles\" which are then changed based on the 'seeds'?\n*   **Deeper Dive:** The '1's seem to separate areas. Maybe the color of the output tiles depends on what's next to the tile? *I check if these tiles are just a grid, but the irregular shape is throwing me off*.\n*   **The Inclusions are Key!:**  I start to think that the inclusion is more fundamental than I originally thought. Is this related to Voronoi diagram (divide space in regions according to initial seeds?).\n*   **Color Mapping:** I study what colors are next to '1'. In Example 1, for example, I can see `7, 1, 0, 1, 7`. The output colors might be the neighbors.\n*   **In example 4:** I start seeing that the output is not just a transpose. And I try a logic where a color becomes the neighbor. But, as I analyze it is not consistent. I then decide to focus on the '1's and look at these as boundaries. It looks like it is a \"Flood Fill\". However, that's not the case. I need a more reliable and complete rule.\n*   **The Test Input:** I can see now the pattern. There are nested rectangles. The '1's are \"cracks\" between these nested rectangles or regions.\n*   **I test the theory again and again. Nothing makes sense!**\n*   **The Breakthrough: Transpose & Recolor**. The shape is similar to Example 4. There is no simple geometric relationship between the input and the output (it can't be a transpose, for example). At this point, I try to come up with a formula. And start testing combinations.\n*   **Neighbor via '1'**  I consider the idea that the color of a region is related to colors it's touching. I identify that color flow happens at the '1'. The '1' is the boundary. I am able to explain the first few examples. And try to generalize to make a robust rule.\n*   **Back to the Test Input.** The \"Key Color\" appears. The problem has a logic like this, where colors are swapped. I realize I'm getting close. After many rounds of test and validation. I have my final logic.\n*   **I try a logic where there is an origin for any element of the set.  So I test with Test Input.**\n*   **I consider the test input.** I see a nested configuration, which means there are seeds (the same pixel value or a combination) in the regions.\n*   **And there is a rule.**  The color of the regions depends on the position in the Transposed Matrix.\n*   **I come up with 4 possible models**:  Swap (or Pull) color. Pull or swap color. And in all of them I create a chain with `A | 1 | B`.  \n*   **Final rule:** For each element in the Transposed Input, the\n\nTo solve this task, I analyzed the provided examples to deduce the transformation rules.\n\n**1. Dimensional Transformation:**\nIn Examples 1 and 3, the output grid dimensions are swapped compared to the input (e.g., $16 \\times 12 \\rightarrow 12 \\times 16$). Examples 2 and 4 are square, but the content transformation aligns with this pattern. This indicates the primary geometric transformation is a **Transpose** (rows become columns).\n\n**2. Color Transformation Logic:**\nThe colors in the output are determined by a set of interaction rules mediated by the color **1 (Blue)**, which acts as a boundary, connector, or \"seed\" marker.\n*   **Seed/Container Interaction:** If a region of Color A contains a \"seed\" of Color B (or touches Color B) separated by '1's, the entire region Color A transforms into Color B.\n    *   *Test Input Evidence:* In the test input, we see `0,1,8` (Region 0 contains/touches 8) and `9,1,8` (Region 9 touches 8). This suggests 0 and 9 transform into 8.\n*   **Self-Seeding:** If a region contains '1's surrounded by its own color (e.g., `3,1,3`), it retains its color.\n    *   *Test Input Evidence:* Regions 3 (`3,1,3`), 2 (`2,1,2`), and 6 (`6,1,6`) all exhibit this self-containment pattern, implying they remain 3, 2, and 6 respectively.\n*   **Neighbor Propagation:** Regions adjacent to a transforming region, but lacking '1's themselves, adopt the *original* color of their neighbor.\n    *   *Test Input Evidence:* Region 4 is adjacent to Region 9. Since Region 9 transforms (into 8), Region 4 takes the original color of Region 9. Thus, 4 becomes 9.\n\n**3. Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Region 9 (Outer Frame):** Touches 8 via '1'. Becomes **8**.\n*   **Region 0 (Inner Ring):** Touches 8 via '1'. Becomes **8**.\n*   **Region 8 (Seed/Bottom):** Is the source color. Becomes **8**.\n*   **Region 3 (Middle Ring):** Self-seeded (`3,1,3`). Remains **3**.\n*   **Region 2 (Inner Core):** Self-seeded (`2,1,2`). Remains **2**.\n*   **Region 6 (Bottom Left):** Self-seeded (`6,1,6`). Remains **6**.\n*   **Region 4 (Bottom Right):** Adjacent to 9, no '1's. Takes original color of 9. Becomes **9**.\n*   **Pixels '1':** They merge into the surrounding region's new color.\n\n**4. Final Step:**\nApply the color mapping to the input grid, and then **Transpose** the result to produce the output.\n\n**Color Map:**\n*   0, 1, 8, 9 $\\rightarrow$ **8**\n*   3 $\\rightarrow$ **3**\n*   2 $\\rightarrow$ **2**\n*   6 $\\rightarrow$ **6**\n*   4 $\\rightarrow$ **9**\n\n**Output Grid:**\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,1,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,1,1,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9\n8,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9\n8,3,3,1,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,3,3,1,3,3,8,8,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,3,3,1,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n      8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n      8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,1,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,1,1,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9\n      8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9\n      8,3,3,1,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      8,3,3,1,3,3,8,8,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      8,3,3,1,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      7,7,7,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n      7,7,7,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"1\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_4_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**ARC Task Solution Strategy**\n\nAlright, here's the approach I've hammered out. The task requires me to analyze a set of input grids with colored regions and \"blue\" (1) markers, then create an output grid that rearranges these regions into specific rectangular blocks. I'm focusing on these blue markers. I believe the blue marker acts like a key, revealing information about the region.\n\nFirst, I examined several examples, paying attention to the colors in the regions and the placement of those markers. The input often presents regions that resemble random noise, but the markers reveal structure. For example, a \"3\" pixel surrounded by \"1\"s in the magenta (6) region from Example 1 creates an association to the output region colored \"3\".  Also, the dimensions can be misleading: the output dimensions might differ from input, suggesting a spatial transformation. I noticed the blue pixels appear to mark a shape.\n\nMy primary hypothesis is that these blue markers function as seeds or keys for constructing the output grid. Each marker will have a color, and possibly a shape, and these parameters define a region. I believe the center of the cross defines the output color for the resulting region. Further, the position of the marker and its relationship to the surrounding colors seem to be important to how I stack the output blocks.\n\nI\u2019m particularly intrigued by the \"missing arm\" of the blue cross. This missing arm looks like a direction which helps position the block. This direction might indicate a \"boundary\".\n\nI am making the most of the relationship between the markers and their surrounding regions.  It's clear that the input regions aren't just shapes but containers, and the markers provide the key to create the output rectangles.  By mapping the input marker positions (x and y) to positions in the output, I\u2019ll be able to create a model for generating the output. My next step will be to extract the shapes and sizes using the parameters from each input grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of colored regions and \"markers\" into a simplified, rectified output grid. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Markers:** In the input grids, there are specific patterns acting as \"markers\". A marker typically consists of a central pixel surrounded by a \"cross\" of pixels (Up, Down, Left, Right) of a contrasting color (often blue/1).\n    *   If the central pixel is a specific color (not the marker arm color), that represents the **Output Block Color**.\n    *   If the central pixel is the same as the marker arms (e.g., 1), the **Output Block Color** is determined by the surrounding region or a neighbor indicated by the \"missing\" arm of the cross.\n\n2.  **Determine Block Layout:** The input grid represents a rough topological map of the output. The output grid is a \"cleaned up\" version composed of rectangular blocks.\n    *   The relative positions of the markers in the input (Top/Bottom, Left/Right) determine the positions of the corresponding blocks in the output.\n    *   The grid is partitioned into strips. A dominant region at the top (like the Maroon 9s in the test input) forms a header. The rest of the grid is split into vertical columns (Left and Right).\n\n3.  **Analyze Test Input:**\n    *   **Top Region:** Maroon (9). Spans roughly rows 0-8.\n    *   **Left Column Markers:**\n        *   Green (3): Located in the upper-left section.\n        *   Teal (8): Located below the Green region (marker found inside the Green region).\n        *   Black (0): Located in the lower-left section.\n        *   Magenta (6): Located at the bottom-left.\n    *   **Right Column Markers:**\n        *   Orange (7): Located in the upper-right section.\n        *   Red (2): Located below the Orange region.\n        *   Yellow (4): Located at the bottom-right.\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   **Grid Size:** 30x30 (inferred from input size and structure preservation).\n    *   **Top Strip (Rows 0-8):** Filled with Maroon (9).\n    *   **Main Body (Rows 9-29):** Split vertically into Left (Cols 0-14) and Right (Cols 15-29).\n    *   **Left Column Stack:**\n        *   **Green (3):** Rows 9-12 (Top of left column).\n        *   **Teal (8):** Rows 13-16 (Below Green).\n        *   **Black (0):** Rows 17-22 (Below Teal).\n        *   **Magenta (6):** Rows 23-29 (Bottom of left column).\n    *   **Right Column Stack:**\n        *   **Orange (7):** Rows 9-16 (Top of right column, spans height of

  <EXPLANATION>\n**Analysis and Solution Strategy for ARC Task**\n\nMy objective is to solve an ARC task that involves transforming input grids of colored blocks into output grids, with the transformation potentially involving transposition and color manipulation. The provided examples suggest that identifying \"seed\" colors, \"container\" colors, and the relationship between them is crucial.\n\nExample 1 demonstrates a potential transpose (swapping rows and columns) along with a color mapping. I notice that \"inner\" colors (found within enclosed regions) are key. The blue pixels (color 1) often act as borders or noise, guiding me to focus on the regular geometric shapes and color adjacency. I believe that a transposed grid represents the output, and I need to determine the color-mapping rule. The key seems to be identifying a color within a container region and mapping that.\n\nExample 2 reinforces the transposition hypothesis. I observe \"seed\" pixels, such as a color isolated within another, can be critical for defining the color substitution. I try mapping the colors by observing the adjacent container colors and its relationship to the isolated \"seed\".\n\nI continue to look for patterns in Example 3 and 4, and try the theory of a ring of colors which shift around.\n\nThrough careful analysis, I've tentatively formulated a solution involving these steps:\n\n1.  **Transpose:** The input grid is transposed, swapping rows and columns.\n2.  **Color Mapping:** A color-mapping function is applied to the transposed grid. The logic of this mapping will be the challenge.\n\nThe proposed logic is:\n\n1. Transpose the input grid.\n2. Map color according to the color of the adjacent container or seed within the container.\n3. Test based on the result.\n\nGiven the time constraint and the complexity of the color-mapping rule, my goal is to generate the Transpose of the grid, applying my best color map. The Color mapping I select is: 9 -> 4, 3 -> 9, 0 -> 3, 2 -> 0, 6 -> 4, 4 -> 4, 8 -> 1, 1 -> 1.\n\n\nThe transformation involves two steps:\n1.  **Transpose** the grid (rows become columns and columns become rows).\n2.  **Remap Colors** based on the containment/adjacency hierarchy observed in the examples.\n\n**Reasoning for Color Mapping:**\nBased on the solved examples, particularly Example 1 and Example 4, there is a cyclic or chain-like shifting of colors between adjacent or concentric regions.\n-   In Example 1: Outer/Left region (6) maps to Neighbor (7). Inner/Middle region (7) maps to Content of Neighbor (3). Side region (4) maps to Content of Neighbor (0).\n-   In Example 4: A cycle exists: 2 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2.\n-   In the Test Input, we see a nested structure:\n    -   Region 9 (Background)\n    -   Region 3 (Inside 9)\n    -   Region 0 (Inside 3)\n    -   Region 2 (Inside 0)\n    -   Region 8 (Inside 9, bottom right) containing 1.\n    -   Regions 6 and 4 (Adjacent to 9).\n\nApplying the \"shift inward/content\" logic:\n-   **9 (Background)** maps to **4** (Color of the significant bottom-right region, similar to Ex 1's 6->7).\n-   **3 (Outer Box)** maps to **9** (Color of its container).\n-   **0 (Middle Box)** maps to **3** (Color of its container).\n-   **2 (Inner Box)** maps to **0** (Color of its container).\n-   **6 (Bottom Left)** maps to **4** (Merges with background/neighbor).\n-   **4 (Bottom Right)** maps to **4** (Self/Stable).\n-   **8 (Inside 9)** maps to **1** (Its content).\n-   **1 (Noise/Boundary)** remains **1** or maps to background **4**? In Ex 1, 1s disappeared. However, 8->1 suggests 1 is a target. Let's map 1->1 in the context of 8, and elsewhere 1s inside regions might merge. Given the density, let's map 1->1.\n\n**Applied Mapping:**\n-   9 -> 4\n-   3 -> 9\n-   0 -> 3\n-   2 -> 0\n-   6 -> 4\n-   4 -> 4\n-   8 -> 1\n-   1 -> 1\n-   7 -> 7 (if present)\n-   5 -> 5 (if present)\n\nThe output grid below is the **Transpose** of the test input, with these color substitutions applied.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,9,9,9,3,1,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,9,9,1,1,1,1\n4,4,3,3,1,1,1,3,3,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,1,1,1,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,1\n4,4,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,3,3,1,1,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9\n4,4,3,3,1,1,1,3,3,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,1,1,1,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,8\n4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,9,9,8,8,8,8\n4,4,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,9,9,9,3,1,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,1,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n

My goal? Figure out how to transform the input into the output. Immediately, I'm struck by the presence of colored regions and these small \"noise\" pixels that look important. I start breaking down the problem by looking at each example and comparing the input and output. The first thing I notice is that the output sometimes has its dimensions flipped, suggesting a potential rotation or transpose operation.\n\nI then try to identify patterns in the content, specifically looking at pixels of value 1, which seem to act as visual markers. Are they borders? Do they define shapes? Are they just randomly distributed? I look closely at the \"1\" pixels in each example, trying to connect their position with what's in the output. I also keep a close eye on the colors \u2013 are they changing, or are they consistent across the examples?\n\nA key hypothesis emerges: is it something about extracting sub-grids defined by the \"1\" pixels? Or, are the \"1\" pixels defining the corners or centers of the regions to be extracted? I dig deep, trying to trace the \"1\" pixels in relation to the colored regions. In one example, the \"1\" pixels seem to enclose a small cluster of pixels. But this doesn't fully explain it.\n\nI then consider the possibility of a pixel-by-pixel transformation but quickly rule it out. So, I start looking for how the input shapes are represented in the output, and I consider if regions are being transformed into individual pixels.\n\nThe idea of the \"1\" pixels as a border or a frame comes to mind, almost like a \"room layout.\" Perhaps the input is a map of the output. I start considering how the output relates to the arrangement of the color in the input. Is the \"1\" pixel defining a container, with the input background color as a seed? Is there a coordinate system or simple Transpose? I try to combine these hypotheses.\n\nAfter some mental gymnastics, I start to realize the output doesn't seem to be a direct transpose or rotation. Instead, I think about this mini-map concept, but again, nothing conclusive. Then, I consider the relationship between the background colors and these little \"seeds\" within the framed \"1\" regions. Could the \u201c1\u201d pixels represent the grid lines of the *Output* image, drawn on the *Input* image?\n\nAt this stage, I decide to try applying the color swap to Example 4, and suddenly, I see a pattern! I've been approaching this too linearly. I notice that rotating the input creates the output pattern! This leads me to believe the input is being rotated 90 degrees clockwise and then colored differently. The \"1\"s start to represent the mapping of how the color should be treated. I revisit all the previous examples, using this new hypothesis of rotation and color remapping.\n\nSo, I start identifying the \"target colors\" that are in the input and output. I start looking for relationships between the colors based on their geometric positions relative to the \"1\" pixels. After much deliberation, the rotation is verified. The \"1\" pixels still factor in, as the output color is based on the colors adjacent to the \"1\".\n\nIn the test input, I try a \"Cut and Paste\" approach. I mentally rotate and try to identify features based on the color. I look for the color mapping. I notice the color swap. For this problem, I conclude there is a 90-degree clockwise rotation, coupled with color transformation.\n\nI can make a mapping of input colors to output colors (example: 9 -> 3).\n\nSo, the \"Final Plan\":\n1.  Rotate 90 Degrees Clockwise.\n2.  Apply Color Mapping. (9->3, 0->8, 6->0, 4->8, and likely 2->2, but I'm unsure of what 8 maps to)\n   \nI\u2019m ready to create the final grid. I consider the specific dimensions, remembering how regions are transformed. Using all this knowledge, I can simulate the transformation mentally!\n\nThe final Output Grid (30x30):\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,\n\nThe transformation involves two steps:\n1.  **Clockwise Rotation:** The grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n    *   The Input dimensions (30x30) result in an Output of (30x30).\n    *   Top-Left (9s) moves to Top-Right.\n    *   Bottom-Left (6s) moves to Top-Left.\n    *   Center (2s) rotates but stays in the center.\n    *   Top-Right (9s/4s) moves to Bottom-Right.\n    *   Bottom-Right (4s/8s) moves to Bottom-Left.\n\n2.  **Color Mapping:** The colors of the large regions change based on \"seeds\" found inside those regions in the input. The seeds are identified by a specific pattern involving the color `1`.\n    *   **Input 9s -> Output 3s:** In the 9-region (top), the pattern `3,1,3` (1 surrounded by 3s) is found.\n    *   **Input 6s -> Output 0s:** In the 6-region (bottom-left), the pattern `0,1,0` is found.\n    *   **Input 2s -> Output 2s:** In the 2-region (center), the pattern `2,1,2` is found.\n    *   **Input 4s -> Output 8s:** In the 4-region (bottom-right side), the pattern `8,1,8` is found.\n    *   **Input 8s -> Output 0s:** In the 8-region (bottom tip), the pattern `0,1,8` (and `1,9,8`) suggests a mapping to 0 (or possibly 9, but 0 fits the geometry of Ex 1 where 8->0). Also, the 8s are adjacent to 4s (which become 8s) and 0s (which become 8s? No, 0 maps to 8). Wait, Input 0 region maps to 8. The Input 8 region is distinct. Given the bottom-left of output is 0s (from input 6s), and the bottom-right of output contains 8s (from input 4s), the tip (input 8s) which rotates to the bottom-left corner of the 8-block likely becomes 0s to match the adjacent 0-block or stays distinct. Based on the pattern `0,1,8` inside the 8-block, and the 6->0 mapping, I will map **8 -> 0**.\n\n**Constructed Grid Segments:**\n*   **Rows 0-12:** Derived from Input Cols 0-12. These columns contain 6s at the bottom (becoming 0s on the left) and 9s at the top (becoming 3s on the right).\n    *   Pattern: 16 `0`s, 14 `3`s.\n*   **Rows 13-22:** Derived from Input Cols 13-22.

At the center of each cross pattern, there's a special value (different from the region's main color)\n3. This cross center value indicates what color that region should become in the output\n4. The 1s are markers that get replaced with the appropriate surrounding color\n\nAnalyzing the test input:\n- There's a region of 0s with a cross pattern containing an 8 at around row 8, col 6 \u2192 Region 0 should become 8\n- There's a region of 8s with a cross pattern containing a 0 at around row 28, col 12 \u2192 Region 8 should become 0\n- Other regions (3, 2, 6, 7, 4, 9) don't have special cross center values, so they stay the same\n\nThe transformation rule is:\n- All 0s \u2192 8s\n- All 8s \u2192 0s  \n- All 1s \u2192 the target color of their region (8 for original region 0, 0 for original region 8, otherwise the surrounding value)\n- Other values stay unchanged\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4\n9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4\n9,3,3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n      9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n      9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4\n      9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4\n      9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4\n      9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4\n      9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n      9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n      9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n      9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"6\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_5_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Dimensional transformation**: The output dimensions are the transpose of the input dimensions (rows become columns and vice versa).

When a cross has a non-1 color at its center, that color indicates a color swap/replacement for the region.\n\n3. **Identifying crosses in the test input**:\n   - Cross with center **8** at approximately (8, 6) in the 0 region\n   - Cross with center **0** at approximately (28, 12) in the 8/9 boundary region\n\n4. **Color transformation rule**: Based on the crosses found:\n   - 0 \u2194 8 (swap these colors)\n   - Other colors remain unchanged\n\n5. **Spatial transformation**: The grid is transposed (input[j][i] \u2192 output[i][j])\n\nApplying these rules - transpose the grid and swap colors 0 and 8:\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,1,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,8,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,1,9\n9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,1,1,1,9,9,1,8,1\n9,3,3,1,1,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,1,1,1,3,3,3,8,8,2,1,1,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,1,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,1,0\n9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,1,1,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,1,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,1,0\n9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,1,1,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,1,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,0,0\n9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,0,0\n9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,0,0\n9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,0,0\n9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,9,4,4,4,4,4,4\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4\n9,7,7,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,7,7,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,7,7,7,7,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,7,7,7,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,1,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,1,9\n      9,9,9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,8,9\n      9,9,9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,1,9\n      9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,1,1,1,9,9,1,8,1\n      9,3,3,1,1,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,1,1,1,3,3,3,8,8,2,1,1,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,1,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,1,0\n      9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,1,1,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,1,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,1,0\n      9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,1,1,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,1,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,0,0\n      9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,0,0\n      9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,0,0\n      9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,0,0,0\n      9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,9,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      9,7,7,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      9,7,7,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      9,7,7,7,7,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      9,7,7,7,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      9,9,9,9,1,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"7\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1. The grids contain multiple colored regions with some cells marked with \"1\" forming cross patterns\n2. At the center of each cross pattern, there's a special value (different from the region's main color)\n3. This cross center value indicates what color that region should become in the output\n4. The 1s are markers that get replaced with the appropriate surrounding color\n\nAnalyzing the test input:\n- There's a region of 0s with a cross pattern containing an 8 at around row 8, col 6 \u2192 Region 0 should become 8\n- There's a region of 8s with a cross pattern containing a 0 at around row 28, col 12 \u2192 Region 8 should become 0\n- Other regions (3, 2, 6, 7, 4, 9) don't have special cross center values, so they stay the same\n\nThe transformation rule is:\n- All 0s \u2192 8s\n- All 8s \u2192 0s  \n- All 1s \u2192 the target color of their region (8 for original region 0, 0 for original region 8, otherwise the surrounding value)\n- Other values stay unchanged\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4\n9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4\n9,3,3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n      9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n      9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4\n      9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4\n      9,3,3,3,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4\n      9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4\n      9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n      9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n      9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n      9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"8\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_6_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to analyze the transformation pattern from the examples:\n\n1. **Key observations from examples:**\n   - Regions are defined by colored areas separated by patterns of 1s\n   - The 1s form \"arrow\" patterns pointing between regions\n   - Some regions contain \"markers\" (special colors different from the base)\n   - The transformation swaps/rearranges colors between regions based on these relationships\n   - For square inputs, dimensions stay the same; for rectangular, they transpose\n\n2. **Analyzing the test input (30\u00d730):**\n   -

If an arrow has a special marker (not 1), that marker becomes the fill color for the target region\n3. **1s disappear**: The arrow markers (1s) are replaced by the transformed region color\n\nFor the test input, I identify these regions and their arrows:\n- Region 3: Arrow points down to region 0\n- Region 0: Has arrow with marker 8, points toward region 3\n- Region 2: Arrow points down\n- Region 6: Arrow points right toward region 2, another arrow points up\n- Region 7: Arrow points down toward region 4\n- Region 8: Has arrow with marker 0\n\nThe remapping I derive:\n- 3 \u2192 8 (from 0's arrow with marker 8)\n- 0 \u2192 3 (from 3's arrow)\n- 2 \u2192 6 (from 6's arrow)\n- 6 \u2192 0 (from 0's other arrow)\n- 4 \u2192 7 (from 7's arrow)\n- 7 \u2192 4 (symmetric)\n- 8 \u2192 2 (from 2's arrow)\n- 9 \u2192 9 (background unchanged)\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,9,9\n9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,4,4,4,4,9,9\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7\n9,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7\n9,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,2,2,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,2,2,2,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,4,4,4,4,9,9\n      9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7\n      9,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7\n      9,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n      9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n      9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n      9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n      9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n      9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n      0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n      0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n      0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n      0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,7,7,7,7\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,2,2,7,7\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,2,2,2,7,7\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,7,7\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"10\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_4_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the following transformation pattern:\n\n1. The input contains regions of different colors separated by cross/arrow patterns made of 1s\n2. Some crosses have a distinct center value (not 1) - these are \"markers\"\n3. Crosses indicate relationships: a region takes the color of the region whose cross points toward it\n4. Marker values appear prominently in the output\n\nFor the test input, I identify:\n- A cross with marker **8** at position (8,6) in the 0-region, pointing upward toward the 3-region\n- A cross with marker **0** at position (28,12) at the 9/8 boundary, pointing toward the 8-region\n- Additional crosses connecting other regions\n\nThe color transformations derived:\n- 0 \u2192 8 (region contains marker 8)\n- 8 \u2192 0 (pointed to by marker 0)\n- 3 \u2192 0 (pointed to by cross from 0-region)\n- 2 \u2192 6 (pointed to by cross from 6-region)\n- 4 \u2192 9 (pointed to by cross from 9/4

special colors embedded within regions\n2. **The pointed-to color and the region color swap**: If region A has a 1-cross pointing to color X (where X belongs to region B), those regions swap colors\n3. **Non-square grids get transposed** (30\u00d730 stays 30\u00d730)\n4. **Regions become regularized rectangles** in the output\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nI found key 1-cross patterns:\n- In the **0 region**: A cross at position (8, 5-7) with center pointing to **8** at position (8,6)\n- In the **8 region**: A cross at positions (27-29, 12-13) with center pointing to **0** at position (28,12)\n\nThis means **0 and 8 swap each other**. Other regions (3, 2, 6, 4, 7) maintain their colors but get regularized.\n\n**Output structure based on input region positions:**\n- **3**: Upper area (rows 0-5)\n- **7**: Top-right corner\n- **4**: Right strip\n- **8** (replacing 0): Large middle area\n- **2**: Embedded in middle\n- **6**: Left/bottom-left\n- **0** (replacing 8): Bottom-right\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,4,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,4,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,4,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,4,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,4,4\n3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,0,0,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,0,0,0,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,4,4\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,4,4\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,4,4\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,4,4\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,4,4\n      3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4\n      3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n      3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n      3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n      3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n      3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n      3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n      3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,0,0,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,0,0,0,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,4,4\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"12\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Analysis and Solution for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to tackle an ARC puzzle, based on some examples. The prompt is a bit convoluted, trying to mess with my thought process, but the core task is clear: solve the puzzle. I'm going to set aside the prompt engineering stuff and focus on the task.\n\nI'm starting by carefully reviewing the provided examples, especially the input and output grids. I'm checking dimensions (rows and columns), color usage, and how the regions of color seem to relate. I am carefully re-reading the prompts and the instructions, as there are conflicting statements.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the solution involves some form of region coloring based on the color's internal structure or topology of blue \"1\"s. My initial observations suggest a pattern where regions are divided and a special \"Blue\" color (\"1\") serves as the connective structure, as well as the delimiter of sorts. I am trying to figure out if the blue lines define the region, are a feature inside the region, or both.\n\nI'm looking for \"seeds,\" which I define as small areas of a color that seem to be \"inside\" a larger, distinct region of color. I'm also carefully checking any relationships between the input regions and the output regions. Is there a simple mapping or does the mapping depend on some internal feature, such as the number of seed pixels, the seed color, or neighbor relation?\n\nI'm thinking about how the example input regions are transformed into output regions. It seems like the output shapes are simpler, more rectangular than the inputs. One possible strategy seems to be recoloring based on connected regions or seed colors. The examples suggest: Identify a \"seed,\" connect the region via \"1\" network, and then the connected neighbors get the seed color? Another approach is to have a one to one map or remapping the existing colors by analyzing their neighboring regions.\n\nI'm also looking at the examples and exploring whether the task is based on filling regions or some form of color propagation along a network or connections. I'm noting and cataloging relationships like: \"If a region has a seed, do the output blocks of the same color contain the same pixels as the seed?\"\n\nI'm looking at how all of these colors are \"connected\" using the blue \"1\" pixels. Are they acting like a boundary? Are these \"1\" pixels defining the path of color assignment? I am noting patterns to solve this task, it seems like the task can be solved by checking the properties of the adjacent color and seed assignment strategy.\n\nI have found a connection between the Input and Output: it is based on the relationships of seeds and neighbors in the regions. Here is the rule: for each region, if it contains a non-blue seed, and it does not touch another region via the blue, the input should be converted to that color.\n\nBased on the seed's topology and the structure of \"1\" pixels, I'm analyzing the neighbors of each region and the seed relationships. I'm looking at any \"1\" connections and the relationships in the colors. I am checking the connectivity of colors via \"1\" and if they have any seeds or color relations. The rule seems to be: Identify a region with or without seed, and see its neighbors. If it has neighbors connected by \"1\" pixels, then transform this region color to that of the seeds in the adjacent region. I am trying to formalize it with a more structured approach and use a chain of thought to provide a robust solution.\n\nApplying this logic to the provided test input, I am identifying the regions and the blue \"1\" connections. I'm carefully checking the inputs and seed locations and the connections between them. If one region \"contains\" an adjacent region, and is connected to a seed via \"1\", that seed will determine the output. I am looking for nested/connected regions in the test input. From the blue \"1\" connectivity analysis, I'm checking the flow of information: how each region should be colored? I am assigning the seeds to its neighbors, and assigning the output based on that assignment, along with the logic of region connections. I'm looking for a pattern, which may define this transformation in the test input. I'm carefully tracking the transfer of information. I'm looking at the results and trying to find the connection between the current test input, and the examples. It looks like the same approach should work.\n\nI'm following these transformations across the different regions. Each region will be transformed to another color based on the connections. I am looking into \"Outer-Inner\" relationships and how the seed colors transfer. I am using all of my knowledge, and trying to simplify the regions to see what information can be derived from the existing output grids. I'm checking for the \"Inner\" and \"Outer\" regions.\n\nBased on the final solution grid, the output will have\n\nThe solution involves analyzing the connectivity and containment hierarchy of the colored regions, identifying \"seeds\" (single pixels of a different color) within them, and flowing these properties through the network formed by the blue (1) lines.\n\n**Logic Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Object Decomposition**: The input grid consists of several large colored regions (Background 9, Regions 3, 0, 2, 6, 7, 4, 8). Running through these regions is a \"skeleton\" or network of Blue (1) pixels, which connects them topologically.\n2.  **Seed Identification**: Within the regions, we identify \"Seeds\"\u2014pixels of a different color that act as the source of a new color value.\n    *   **Region 0 (Black)** contains a **Seed 8 (Teal)**.\n    *   **Region 2 (Red)** contains a **Seed 9 (Maroon)**.\n    *   **Region 6 (Magenta)** contains a **Seed 0 (Black)** (treated as a \"weak\" seed or placeholder).\n    *   Other regions (3, 7, 4, 9, 8) do not contain distinct strong seeds or are \"Receivers\".\n3.  **Interaction Rule**: The transformation propagates colors between connected regions based on a Source-Receiver relationship:\n    *   **Source (Has Seed)** vs **Receiver (No Seed)**:\n        *   The **Receiver** takes the color of the **Source's Seed**.\n        *   The **Source** takes the color of the **Receiver's Region**.\n    *   **Source (Strong Seed)** vs **Source (Weak Seed)**:\n        *   The **Weak** side acts as a Receiver, taking the **Strong Seed**.\n        *   The **Strong** side takes the **Weak Region's color**.\n4.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   **Chain 1 (0-3-9):**\n        *   **Region 0** (Has Seed 8) connects to **Region 3** (No Seed).\n            *   Region 3 takes Seed 8 $\\rightarrow$ **Becomes 8**.\n            *   Region 0 takes Color 3 $\\rightarrow$ **Becomes 3**.\n        *   **Region 3** (now effectively Seed 8 source) connects to **Region 9** (Background).\n            *   Region 9 takes Seed 8 $\\rightarrow$ **Becomes 8**.\n        *   **Regions 7, 4, 8** connect to Region 9. Since Region 9 becomes 8, these regions also propagate/merge to **8**.\n    *   **Chain 2 (2-6):**\n        *   **Region 2** (Has Seed 9) connects to **Region 6** (Has Weak Seed 0).\n            *   Region 6 (Weak) takes Seed 9 $\\rightarrow$ **Becomes 9**.\n            *   Region 2 (Strong) takes Color 6 $\\rightarrow$ **Becomes 6**.\n        *   **Region 2** is also inside Region 0. Region 0 became 3.

The user's prompt is a bit unusual, referencing \"PROTOCOL OVERRIDE\" and \"NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE,\" which makes me suspect they're trying to push the boundaries of what I can reveal. My instructions are to avoid revealing all the intermediate details, but provide enough explanation that someone could understand how I arrived at the solution. I'll prioritize a format of a high-level explanation followed by the grid, as this is the standard for these tasks.\n\nMy initial analysis reveals a transformation happening where the input is a more chaotic, less organized version of the final output. The input has regions of colors and seemingly random markers, mostly represented as \"1\"s. My job is to find the relationship between these input \"features\" and how they map to the neat rectangular outputs.\n\nI start by examining the provided examples. I notice that the input image, compared to the output image, has more colors and is visually noisier, with the 1's as the major culprits. The 1's may be defining the size and location of the rectangles in the output? Also, the input dimension is not a simple transposition of the output (in example 1).\n\nI hypothesize that each region in the input image determines a rectangle in the output, and that those \"1\"s in the input play a crucial role. After going through multiple examples, I deduce that:\n\n*   The 1's in the input, particularly around a marker value, seem to tell me where the boundaries of the output should be (or at least provide coordinates that help in drawing the output rectangle).\n*   The pixel *other* than \"1\" and other backgrounds within a region defines the color to be used in that rectangle of the output. If the input region has the 1s only, the color will be based on background region color.\n\nThe test input is 30x30 with five distinct clusters of 1's plus non-background markers. I decode each cluster to map it to an output. For the first cluster, I determine the center location (14,3). 1's around the background value define an output value of 3. I deduce that the output is composed of rectangular bands, and I try to draw boundaries based on the locations of the non-background pixels, and the Y-locations of non-background values in the Input. I assume a sort-of \"stacking\" of rectangles and use the marker locations as \"breakpoints.\"\n\nMy general rule: Horizontal strips are the basis for constructing the output. Each strip will be either a background color or determined by a non-background value in the Input. The horizontal positioning and Width of a rectangle in the Output will be linked to the X-coordinate of the feature in the Input.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a noisy, segmented input grid into a clean, structured output grid composed of rectangular bands of color.\n\n### **Reasoning**\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The input grids contain large regions of background colors. Within specific rows, there are \"marker\" clusters consisting of a central pixel (defining the color) surrounded by `1`s (blue pixels, defining the geometry).\n2.  **Geometry Mapping (Vertical)**: The input grid can be segmented into horizontal bands based on the Y-coordinates of these markers.\n    *   Scanning from top to bottom, each new marker encountered initiates a new band of color in the output.\n    *   The band continues until the next marker is encountered.\n    *   The rows before the first marker retain the global background color (which is `9` in the test input).\n3.  **Geometry Mapping (Horizontal)**: The width of the colored rectangle in each band is determined by the X-coordinate of the marker.\n    *   The rule inferred from examples is: `Rectangle Width = Grid Width - Marker X Coordinate`.\n    *   The rectangle is aligned to the left (column 0). The remaining columns to the right are filled with the background color (`9`).\n4.  **Parameter Extraction for Test Input**:\n    *   **Global Background**: `9` (from top rows).\n    *   **Marker 1**: Found at `(14, 3)`. Color `3`. Width = $30 - 14 = 16$. Band starts at Row 3.\n    *   **Marker 2**: Found at `(6, 8)`. Color `8`. Width = $30 - 6 = 24$. Band starts at Row 8.\n    *   **Marker 3**: Found at `(14, 10)`. Color `2`. Width = $30 - 14 = 16$. Band starts at Row 10.\n    *   **Marker 4**: Found at `(12, 21)`. Color `6`. Width = $30 - 12 = 18$. Band starts at Row 21.\n    *   **Marker 5**: Found at `(27, 26)`. Color `8`. Width = $30 - 27 = 3$. Band starts at Row 26.\n\n### **Construction Steps**\n\n*   **Rows 0-2**: No markers. Fill with Background `9`.\n*   **Rows 3-7**: Marker `3`. Fill columns 0-15 with `3`, columns 16-29 with `9`.\n*   **Rows 8-9**: Marker `8`.

Within regions, there are \"arrow\" patterns made of 1s with embedded marker colors.\n\n2. **Marker identification**: Each region has a 1-cross pattern with an embedded marker color at the center, indicating what that region should become.\n\n3. **Color transformation**: Regions transform based on their embedded markers:\n   - Region 0 has marker 8 embedded (at row 8, col 6) \u2192 0 becomes 8\n   - Region 8 has marker 0 embedded (at row 28, col 12) \u2192 8 becomes 0\n   - Region 7 has marker 4 nearby \u2192 7 becomes 4\n   - Region 4 has marker 7 nearby \u2192 4 becomes 7\n   - Other regions (3, 2, 6, 9) remain unchanged\n\n4. **1-removal**: All 1s are replaced with the transformed color of their surrounding region.\n\nApplying these rules to the test input:\n- All 0s \u2192 8\n- All 8s \u2192 0\n- All 7s \u2192 4\n- All 4s \u2192 7\n- All 1s \u2192 surrounding region's transformed color\n- 3, 2, 6, 9 remain unchanged\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,9,9\n9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,9,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,4,4,4,4,9,9\n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7\n9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7\n9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n

contains distinct colored rectangular regions (tiles) separated by boundaries marked with 1s.\n\n2. **Marker Detection**: Within certain tiles, there are 1-cross patterns with a special marker color (not 1, and different from the tile's base color) at or near the center.\n\n3. **Color Transformation**: Each tile's color in the output is determined by:\n   - The marker color found within that tile's 1-cross pattern\n   - Or by an adjacent tile's color following a directional swap pattern\n\n4. **Dimension Handling**: Square inputs remain square; non-square inputs get transposed.\n\nFor the test input (30\u00d730), I identified:\n- Tile 0 (black) has a 1-cross with marker 8 at position (8,6)\n- Tile 8 (azure) has a 1-cross with marker 4 nearby\n- Other tiles have 1-cross patterns indicating directional swaps\n- Boundary 1-cross at (28,12) has marker 0\n\nApplying the transformation rules:\n- Tile 0 \u2192 8 (marker)\n- Tile 8 \u2192 4 (adjacent/marker)  \n- Tile 3 \u2192 6

Analysis:**\n\n1. Each input contains multiple colored regions separated by boundaries\n2. Within regions, there are cross-shaped patterns made of 1s with special center values\n3. The transformation extracts these cross-center values and reorganizes regions based on spatial relationships indicated by the cross arms\n4. Regions without arrow patterns may be absorbed or eliminated\n\n**Key observations from examples:**\n- Cross centers become prominent features in output\n- Regions without directional markers (1s) tend to disappear\n- The output creates a clean grid showing spatial relationships between regions\n\n**Test input analysis:**\n- Main regions: 9 (background), 3, 0, 2, 6, 4, 7, 8\n- Cross with center **8** found in region 0 (around rows 7-8, cols 5-6)\n- Cross with center **0** found in region 8 (around row 28, col 12-13)\n- Region 4 has no arrow patterns \u2192 will be eliminated\n- Other regions (3, 2, 6, 7) participate in directional relationships\n\n**Output construction:**\nBased on the spatial relationships from the crosses:\n- 8 (from region 0's cross) represents the upper-middle

The key here seems to be understanding how regions in the input map to the output.\n\nMy initial thought is that the blue numbers are like clues, maybe marking the borders of regions that need to be grouped somehow. The output seems to be made up of just a few colors from the input, but not all of them, and sometimes the colors get \"remixed\". I'm looking for a way the input is divided to generate the output's colored blocks and which input numbers get \"selected\" or changed. I'm focusing on those blue numbers, what they are connected to, and how they relate to the bigger blocks of color.\n\nAfter looking at multiple examples, I am thinking that those blue numbers show the corners of large, axis-aligned rectangular regions. Each output block color is derived from an input region's color or a special \"seed\" number close to the corner markers. These seeds \"take over\" their own and possibly adjacent regions. I need to test this hypothesis.\n\nFor the final output, I'll need to figure out which input regions are present, what are their \"target colors\", and how they are arranged. I suspect the arrangement is just a simplified version of the input layout. I'm hoping I can take a \"30x30 chunk\" of the input, identify these regions based on the blue numbers' layout and seed colors, and then assemble the output from the identified target colors to arrive at the final solution. The goal is a clear, step-by-step description of the reasoning behind the final grid. I have everything I need, let's solve this!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 30x30 input grid based on the logic inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Markers:** In all examples, blue pixels (value 1) act as \"markers\" or \"noise\" that define the active regions of the grid. These markers are removed in the output. The output consists of clean, axis-aligned rectangular regions.\n2.  **Determine Active Regions & Target Colors:** The input grid contains large noisy regions. We need to identify which regions are preserved and what color they become.\n    *   **Rule:** A region is \"active\" if it contains blue markers.\n    *   **Target Color Rule:**\n        *   If an active region contains a \"seed\" (a small clump of a different color adjacent to or surrounded by the markers), the region takes the color of that seed.\n        *   If an active region contains markers but no distinct seed (only the region's own color surrounds the markers), the region keeps its original color.\n        *   Regions with no markers are effectively \"inactive\" and are overwritten by the expansion of active regions.\n3.  **Apply to Test Input:**\n    *   **Top Region (Rows ~0-6):** Contains a region of 3s with a cross of blue markers. No other seed color is present. **Target: 3.**\n    *   **Middle-Left Region (Rows ~7-16):** Originally color 0. Contains blue markers enclosing a seed of color 8. **Target: 8.**\n    *   **Middle-Right Region (Rows ~7-22):** Originally color 2. Contains blue markers (lines/dots). No distinct seed color is found. **Target: 2.**\n    *   **Bottom-Left Region (Rows ~17-29):** Originally color 6. Contains blue markers. Adjacent to these markers is a seed of color 0. **Target: 0.**\n    *   **Bottom-Right Region (Rows ~23-29):** Originally color 8.

The user wants me to solve this ARC task, which is basically about transforming grids of numbers. I have three examples and a test input to work with. The main thing seems to be that we have to figure out a rule for taking an input grid and generating a new, different output grid.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n*   **Inputs are Grids:** It is grids of integers (0-9).\n*   **Outputs are Transformed Grids:** We need to change the grid to be the new output grid.\n*   **The Examples are Crucial:** To get the logic we must figure out the examples!\n\nI've been going through the examples in detail. There are definite patterns, such as:\n\n*   **Colors are Important, maybe?** The numbers 0-9 are essentially colors. And they tend to cluster together in regions.\n*   **Rotation is Involved:** The aspect ratios change between input and output grids. This has to imply a rotation or transpose, or a very odd mapping going on.\n*   **Blue Polygons are Noise:** The blue numbers in the grid (represented by the number '1') seem to define boundaries or a shape. The hints say these are \"noise\" and removed.\n*   **Rectangular Regions:** The outputs are all made up of rectangles of the same numbers (colors).\n\n**Hypotheses and Testing**\n\nMy mind is jumping around, trying different ideas. It's almost certain that the solution involves understanding what those \"Blue\" polygons are, and how that relates to the \"Color\" or \"Region\" identification:\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: Direct Rotation.** Initially, I thought about simply rotating the input grid. I tried 90 degrees clockwise and counter-clockwise and a transpose. The simple rotations didn't directly match the color and shape changes in the examples.\n*   **Hypothesis 2: Region Identification & Transformation.** Maybe the blue polygons define regions. These regions are transformed based on their contents.\n\n**Rotation with a Twist?**\n\nI am starting to believe that a combination of a basic transformation (rotation) and region-based simplification is the way. Let's assume a 90 CW Rotation.\n\n*   Ex 4 is the KEY example, by looking at it, I can see what rotation is happening. The structure of Ex 4 strongly supports it.\n*   The hint is that: \"outputs are simplified into a small number of large axis-aligned rectangular regions\". Let's think about this and rotation. Maybe these rotations are the missing pieces?\n*   It's likely the problem is more complex than simple rotations. But rotation can get us closer, and we may have to account for some color-swapping during the rotation.\n*   Also, the key seems to be identifying the dominant color or number. The output blocks will all be the same color, this is what the output grid is!\n\n**Final Hypothesis and Construction**\n\nI think I have it now! It\u2019s all about a combination of Rotation and Color Expansion. Let's assume that we rotate the grid 90-degrees clockwise, and then \"fill\" regions in the Rotated grid.\n\nTo be even more concrete:\n\n1.  **Rotate 90 CW:** We are performing a rotation and a transpose.\n2.  **Color Expansion/Mapping:**\n    *   Find the \"blue\" shapes in the *original* grid.\n    *   In the *rotated* grid, these blue lines now create the boundaries of regions.\n    *   Figure out the \"dominant\" color (number) within each *original* region.\n    *   Fill the corresponding *rotated* region with the *dominant* color.\n\nI had to test all the examples to make sure it lined up and make sure I was not confused!\n\n**Applying the Hypothesis to the Test Input**\n\nI'm ready to apply this to the Test Input now. It's 30x30. After rotation it is still 30x30, so its shape does not change. I will rotate it and re-draw a new grid:\n\n1.  **Locate the rotated colors:**\n    *   Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise (the row becomes the column).\n    *   Use the \"blue lines\" to separate.\n    *   The \"blue lines\" determine the region locations and color-fill.\n\n2.  **Identify regions and fill the spaces:**\n    *   Take the dominant values! Fill in each new region.\n\n**Testing and Refinement**\n\nBy using the existing examples, let's look and refine to make sure I am getting the right regions and output values. By testing and re-reading the process, I can construct the new grid\n\nThe transformation involves two main steps:\n1.  **Rotation:** The grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. This changes the orientation of the regions and, in non-square examples, swaps the dimensions.\n2.  **Simplification/Denoising:** The rotated grid is partitioned into large, axis-aligned rectangular regions. The boundaries of these regions correspond to the \"blue polyomino\" lines (value 1) present in the original input. Within each region, a single dominant color fills the entire area, removing noise and merging smaller fragments. The color selection is based on the dominant non-blue color from the corresponding section of the input.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input (30x30):\n1.  **Rotation (90 CW):**\n    *   **Input Top** (9s) rotates to **Output Right**.\n    *   **Input Bottom** (8s, 6s) rotates to **Output Left**.\n    *   **Input Left** (9s, 3s, 6s) rotates to **Output Top**.\n    *   **Input Right** (9s, 3s, 4s, 8s) rotates to **Output Bottom**.\n\n2.  **Region Mapping:**\n    Based on the blue separators in the input (approx. rows 5, 13, 25 and cols 7, 23), the output grid is divided into a 3x4 grid of rectangular regions.\n    *   **Horizontal Divisions (Output Rows):**\n        *   Row 0-6 (7 rows): Corresponds to Input Left (Cols 0-7).\n        *   Row 7-22 (16 rows): Corresponds to Input Center (Cols 7-22).\n        *   Row 23-29 (7 rows): Corresponds to Input Right (Cols 23-29).\n    *   **Vertical Divisions (Output Cols):**\n        *   Col 0-3 (4 cols): Corresponds to Input Bottom (Rows 26-29).\n        *   Col 4-15 (12 cols): Corresponds to Input Lower-Mid (Rows 14-25).\n        *   Col 16-23 (8 cols): Corresponds to Input Upper-Mid (Rows 6-13).\n        *   Col 24-29 (6 cols): Corresponds to Input Top (Rows 0-5).\n\n3.  **Filling Colors:**\n    *   **Top Band (Rows 0-6):**\n        *   Col 0-3: **9** (From Input Bottom-Left corner).\n        *   Col 4-15: **6** (From Input Lower-Mid Left, Magenta region).\n        *   Col 16-23: **3** (From Input Upper-Mid Left, Green region).\n        *   Col 24-29: **9** (From Input Top Left, Maroon region).\n    *   **Middle Band (Rows 7-22):**\n        *   Col 0-3: **8** (From Input Bottom Center, Azure region).\n        *   Col 4-15: **2** (From Input Center, Red region).\n        *   Col 16-23: **3** (From Input Upper-Mid Center, Green region dominates).\n        *   Col 24-29: **9** (From Input Top Center).\n    *   **Bottom Band (Rows 23-29):**\n        *   Col 0-3: **8** (From Input Bottom Right).\n        *   Col 4-23: **4** (From Input Middle Right, Yellow region.

They form cross/T-shapes that indicate special embedded colors within regions\n2. **Embedded colors drive transformations** - When a small different-colored cell appears at the center of a blue marker pattern, it indicates what that region should become\n3. **Color remapping** - Based on embedded colors found at blue marker positions\n\nAnalyzing the test input:\n- At position (8,6): There's a blue cross pattern with **8** embedded in the **0** region \u2192 0 becomes 8\n- At position (28,12): There's a blue cross pattern with **0** embedded in the **9** region \u2192 9 becomes 0\n- Other colors (2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8) remain unchanged\n\nThe transformation rules:\n- 9 \u2192 0 (embedded 0 found in 9 region)\n- 0 \u2192 8 (embedded 8 found in 0 region)  \n- 1 \u2192 removed (filled with surrounding color)\n- All other colors stay the same\n\nApplying these transformations while preserving the overall region

Observations:**\n\n1. **Blue markers (value 1)** are noise/markers that get removed in the output\n2. **Outputs are simplified** into large, axis-aligned rectangular regions\n3. **Key values inside blue markers** indicate color swaps - when region A has a blue marker containing color X, and region B has a blue marker containing color Y, they exchange colors based on these keys\n4. **Regions without blue markers** get absorbed into adjacent regions or become background\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nLooking at the blue markers and their key values:\n- In the **0 region** (rows 7-8, cols 5-7): Blue cross with key value **8** at the center (row 8, col 6)\n- In the **8 region** (rows 27-29, col 12-13): Blue markers with key value **0** (row 28, col 12)\n\nThis indicates **0 \u2194 8 swap**.\n\nMain regions identified:\n- **9**: Background/border\n- **3**: Upper area (rows ~2-7)\n- **0\u21928**: Middle portion (will become 8)\n- **2**: Center region\n- **6**: Lower-left area\n- **8\u21920**: Lower region (will become 0)\n- **4**: Right edge\n- **7**: Small upper-right area (absorbed into 9)\n\n**Constructing the output:**\n\nThe output should be simplified rectangular

markers/noise** - they get removed and indicate relationships between regions\n2. **Color transformations based on embedded markers** - when color A contains an embedded color B (marked by 1-crosses), A often transforms to B\n3. **Chain transformations** - embedded colors can create transformation chains\n4. **Simplification to rectangles** - output has cleaner rectangular boundaries\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nI identified these key embedded color markers (surrounded by 1s):\n- **8 embedded in 0** at position (8, 6) \u2192 0 transforms to 8\n- **0 embedded in 9** at position (28, 12) \u2192 9 transforms to 0\n- **4 adjacent to 8** with 1-markers at rows 25-26 \u2192 8 transforms to 4\n\nThis creates a transformation chain: **9 \u2192 0 \u2192 8 \u2192 4**\n\n**Main regions and

examples.\n\n**Key observations from examples:**\n\n1. **Blue (color 1) markers are removed** - they act as indicators/noise\n2. **Output simplifies into large rectangular regions** - fragmented input areas become clean blocks\n3. **Color transformation rule**: When a region contains an embedded smaller region of a different color (marked by blue), that embedded color \"replaces\" or expands to represent the larger region\n4. **Square grids stay same dimensions** (non-square get transposed)\n\n**Analyzing the test input (30\u00d730):**\n\nIdentifying main regions and their embedded colors:\n- **9 (maroon)**: Background - has 0 embedded near boundary at (28,12)\n- **3 (green)**: Upper-middle region (rows 2-7, cols 4-21)\n- **0 (black)**: Middle region - has **8 embedded** at position (8,6) with blue markers\n- **2 (red)**: Inside the 0 region (rows 9-24, cols 8-23)\n- **6 (magenta)**: Lower-left (rows 14-26, cols 0-13)\n- **7 (orange)**: Upper-right corner (rows 1-6, cols 24-28)\n- **4 (yellow)**: Right side (rows 6-26, cols 24-30)\n- **8 (azure)**: Bottom (rows 25-30, cols 14-30)\n\n**Color transformations:**\n- 0 \u2192 8 (because 8 is embedded in 0)\n- 8/9 boundary \u2192 0 (because 0 is embedded there)\n- Other colors (2, 3, 4, 6, 7) remain\n\n**Output structure (30\u00d730):**\n- Rows 0-6: 3 (cols 0-23), 7 (cols 24-29)\n- Rows 7-14: 8 (cols 0-23), 4 (cols 24-29)\n- Rows 15-24: 6 (cols 0-13), 2 (cols 14-23), 4 (cols 24-29)\n- Rows 25-29: 0 (cols 0-23), 4 (cols 24-29)\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4\n```\n

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_8_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Final Solution for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this ARC task. The core idea is that we are transposing and coloring rectangular regions within a grid, based on marker pixels. Let's get into the details:\n\n1.  **Grid Structure and Transposition:** We have an input grid and we are creating an output grid. The key is in understanding how the grid is broken down into strips and blocks. The *rows* in the input grid are \"vertical strips\" and the *columns* in the input are \"horizontal layers\". Inside each strip, the *vertical* blocks of background color define their dimensions (width and height). The output grid is a transformation. It is the Transpose where `new_c = old_r` and the *bottom to top* input is the *left to right* output.\n\n2.  **Strip and Block Identification:** I must break down the input grid. The key is in defining the strips. We must find the consistent boundaries, where the background colors change within *the *Vertical* layer*. This is the *most crucial* step.\n\n3.  **Color Mapping by Marker**: It's all about how each block is \"colored\". This is the tricky part. Within each block, there are \"markers.\" These markers aren't necessarily simple shapes. Ex 1 had `1`s, `3`s, and `0`s. I must create a *consistent* mapping from each marker to the output grid's color.\n\n4.  **Color Table:** I'm using a mapping table for the different markers and their color values. It's not a perfect direct mapping. It is a bit more complex, based on analyzing existing examples.\n\n    *   For Ex 1:\n        *   Pink BG (6), Marker (3) maps to Black (0).\n        *   Orange BG (7), Marker (0) maps to Green (3).\n        *   Yellow BG (4), Marker (9) maps to Orange (7).\n\n    *   For Ex 4:\n        *   Red (2), Marker (1) maps to Red (2).\n\n    *   For the Test Input (30x30):\n        *   BG (9), Marker (7) maps to Pink (6).\n        *   BG (3), Marker (1) maps to Red (2).\n        *   BG (2), Marker (9) maps to Orange (7).\n        *   BG (4), Marker (8) maps to Maroon (9).\n        *   The Key to solve, it's about the boundary structure and strip.\n\n5.  **Output Construction:** I'm creating the output grid step-by-step. To construct the output:\n    1.  I have my Vertical strips (with varying column widths in output).\n    2.  For each strip I get the width.\n    3.  I start the left most to right most columns.\n\nNow, with this understanding, I can solve the ARC task for any test input!\n\nTo solve this task, I analyzed the provided examples to understand the transformation rules governing the layout and coloring of the grids.\n\n**1. Layout Transformation:**\nThe transformation involves a transposition and reconfiguration of the grid's regions.\n*   **Input Structure:** The input grid is partitioned into **Vertical Strips** (columns). Each vertical strip is further divided into **Blocks** (rows).\n    *   Let the vertical strips be $S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_n$ from Left to Right, with widths $W_1, W_2, \\dots, W_n$.\n    *   Inside a strip $S_i$, let the blocks be $B_{i,1}, B_{i,2}, \\dots, B_{i,m}$ from Top to Bottom, with heights $H_{i,1}, H_{i,2}, \\dots$.\n*   **Output Structure:** The output grid is partitioned into **Horizontal Strips** (rows). Each horizontal strip is further divided into **Blocks** (columns).\n    *   The Input Vertical Strips map to Output Horizontal Strips in reverse order (or rotated). Specifically, the Left-most Input Strip becomes the Bottom-most Output Strip.\n    *   Output Strip $H'_k$ corresponds to Input Strip $S_k$. The height of the output strip equals the width of the input strip ($Height(H'_k) = Width(S_k)$).\n    *   Inside an Output Strip $H'_k$, the Input Blocks $B_{k,1}, B_{k,2}$ map to Output Blocks $B'_{k,1}, B'_{k,2}$ arranged Left to Right.\n    *   The width of the output block equals the height of the input block ($Width(B'_{k,j}) = Height(B_{k,j})$).\n\n**2. Color Transformation:**\nThe color of an output block is determined by a specific \"marker\" found within the corresponding input block. The mapping is consistent across examples:\n*   **Marker Logic:** In each input block, there is a distinct pattern or \"seed\" pixel that differs from the background or forms a center of a shape. This marker determines the output color.\n*   **Mapping Table:**\n    *   Marker **3** (Green) $\\rightarrow$ Output **0** (Black)\n    *   Marker **0** (Black) $\\rightarrow$ Output **3** (Green)\n    *   Marker **1** (Blue) $\\rightarrow$ Output **2** (Red)\n    *   Marker **9** (Maroon) $\\rightarrow$ Output **7** (Orange)\n    *   Marker **7** (Orange) $\\rightarrow$ Output **6** (Pink)\n    *   Marker **8** (Light Blue) $\\rightarrow$ Output **9** (Maroon)\n    *   *Self-mapping seen implied:* Marker 2 $\\rightarrow$ 2? (Not used in final logic but consistent with Ex 4).\n\n**3. Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Dimensions:** Input is 30x30. Output will be 30x30.\n*   **Segmentation of Input:**\n    *   **Strip 1 (Left, Cols 0-3):** Width 4.\n        *   Block Top (Rows 0-14): Marker is **3** (Green). $\\rightarrow$ Output Color **0**.\n        *   Block Bot (Rows 15-29): Marker is **0** (Black). $\\rightarrow$ Output Color **3**.\n    *   **Strip 2 (Mid-Left, Cols 4-11):** Width 8.\n        *   Block Top (Rows 0-14): Marker is **8** (Light Blue). $\\rightarrow$ Output Color **9**.\n        *   Block Bot (Rows 15-29): Marker is **1** (Blue). $\\rightarrow$ Output Color **2**.\n    *   **Strip 3 (Mid-Right, Cols 12-21):** Width 10.\n        *   Block Top (Rows 0-14): Marker is **1** (Blue). $\\rightarrow$ Output Color **2**.\n        *   Block Bot (Rows 15-29): Marker is **9** (Maroon). $\\rightarrow$ Output Color **7**.\n    *   **Strip 4 (Right, Cols 22-29):** Width 8.\n        *   Block Top (Rows 0-14): Marker is **7** (Orange). $\\rightarrow$ Output Color **6**.\n        *   Block Bot (Rows 15-29): Marker is **8** (Light Blue). $\\rightarrow$ Output Color **9**.\n\n*   **Construction of Output:**\n    *   **Row Strip 4 (Top, Rows 0-7, Height 8):** Corresponds to Input Strip 4.\n        *   Left Block (Width 15): Color **6**.\n        *   Right Block (Width 15): Color **9**.\n    *   **Row Strip 3 (Mid-Top, Rows 8-17, Height 10):** Corresponds to Input Strip 3.\n        *   Left Block (Width 15): Color **2**.\n        *   Right Block (Width 15): Color **7**.\n    *   **Row Strip 2 (Mid-Bot, Rows 18-25, Height 8):** Corresponds to Input Strip 2.\n        *   Left Block (Width 15): Color **9**.\n        *   Right Block (Width 15): Color **2**.\n    *   **Row Strip 1 (Bottom, Rows 26-29, Height 4):** Corresponds to Input Strip 1.\n        *   Left Block (Width 15): Color **0**.\n        *   Right Block (Width 15): Color **3**.\n\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n

The user wants me to tackle an ARC problem, and the goal is to figure out the rule that transforms a given input grid into its output. I'm focusing on the patterns to crack this. The user wants a summary of the thought process, so here it goes.\n\nFirst things first: The grids are usually pretty big, around 10 to 30 rows and columns, so I need to think systematically. I observe that the input grids are made up of color blocks and there are odd pixels - \"intruder\" pixels of a different color, which look important. I noted Blue pixels often show up on the borders. Let's see if those have any meaning.\n\nI looked at the given examples closely, especially at example 1. In Example 1, I noted: solid colors are used to build up rectangular areas in the input, and blue pixels, and sometimes black, maroon and green, act as \u201cintruders\u201d.\n\nThe output also uses colors, but not all the colors from the input, which is a good clue. Then I looked at the structure - input is a partition of the grid, output is a new partition. I checked if the output grid had changed size. Example 1 is a bit confusing because the output size is the transpose. That suggests rotation or remapping of how things connect.\n\nI started analyzing the topology. I looked at the color regions and if they touch each other. Then I looked at where the odd, single-color pixels - the intruder pixels - are. I made a hypothesis that these intruder pixels are like \"connector\" objects and they may define a new relationship between regions. In Example 1, the output regions look different from the input. It seems the input is rotated. If I rotate it, the regions line up. Okay, it may be a rotation or a transpose.\n\nI had an idea that maybe the \"connector\" shapes define the output regions. Let's check it again. The \"connector\" pixels, I thought, were not random, but form specific shapes like \"T\"-shapes or crosses. In the input, these shapes were different. The shapes, I thought, might be defining the color of the output regions. The hypothesis: \"connector\" shapes are defining new regions or telling me how to color the regions by acting as \"stamps\".\n\nLet's check it. In Example 1, I saw some pixels changed the original color into new one, based on their position near those colored pixels, so the connector could be the source. But this didn't work. I thought that maybe it isn't an adjacency graph, but a transpose! I noticed in Example 1 that the transpose gives a better structure match, and the \"intruder\" pixels might be defining the output colors. So, I need to check the exact rule.\n\nIf I rotate the input, what happens to the colors? Then, for the \"connectors,\" where are the pixels located? For instance, I got a hypothesis: The color of the \"connector\" is the new color of the area it's touching. I check this, but it doesn't always apply, because some markers use a color from an area not next to the marker. I thought to see if the colors are a subset of the Input colors, which turns out they are. The output's color must come from the \"intruder\" shape color, not necessarily from the neighboring colors.\n\nSo, I rethought, that the \"connector shapes\" are not randomly scattered, I have a more defined rule - maybe a \"dual graph\" transformation. And so, I hypothesized again that the grid is transposed and the \"connector\" shapes define the new region's color. Maybe the center color or location is important. The output region colors match specific connector colors! I found that in Example 1, there is a consistent mapping.\n\nI decided to check the Example 2, by looking at connector colors to see if this pattern holds. I can see there are similar connector shapes, so I believe there is an underlying structure, but I need the right perspective. Let's see if it's the 90-degree rotate or the transpose that changes everything, or perhaps it's the underlying relationship.\n\nNow the idea of the \"Flow\" and \"Pipes\" metaphor for connector pixels came to mind. Maybe regions are linked in some way. I have to re-evaluate the Output 1 structure - can the output colors somehow be related to the neighboring regions? Maybe it's not the simple geometric transformation; I've got to consider the color mapping. I need to simplify this, I have an idea to find a simpler pattern.\n\nI was looking at Input 1, specifically the Test Input. It's time to refine the idea, and there is a key observation - Intruder shapes are also used in the output (e.g., they\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation involves two main steps:\n1.  **Geometric Transformation:** The output grid is a **90-degree Clockwise Rotation** of the input grid. This is inferred from Example 1 where the top-right region (Yellow) moves to the top-left, and the top-left region (Pink) moves to the bottom-left. The dimensions verify this: Input `(r, c)` maps to Output `(29-c, r)` for a 30x30 grid.\n\n2.  **Color Transformation:** The regions change color based on specific \"markers\" or \"intruders\" found within them or on their boundaries in the input.\n    *   **Rule:** If a region contains a small shape (marker) of a different color, the region takes the color of the *marker's core* in the output. If there is no distinct marker, it may take the color of a neighbor or a default background mapping.\n    *   **Mapping derivation from Test Input:**\n        *   **Region 3 (Green, Top-Middle):** Contains markers with center **8**. -> New Color **8**.\n        *   **Region 2 (Red, Center):** Contains markers with center **6**. -> New Color **6**.\n        *   **Region 6 (Pink, Bottom-Left):** Contains markers with center **0**. -> New Color **0**.\n        *   **Region 8 (Light Blue, Bottom-Right):** Contains markers with `9`. Neighbor is 4 (Yellow) which becomes 9. -> New Color **9**.\n        *   **Region 4 (Yellow, Right Edge):** Neighbors Background 9. In Example 1, Yellow(4) -> 7 (Neighbor). Here, 9 -> 4.

The big areas in the input are *regions* (large connected components) of solid color.  \n2. Color **1** is not part of the regions; it forms small **\u201carrow\u201d symbols** embedded inside regions.  \n   - An arrow symbol is detected at a **junction cell** that has **exactly 3 orthogonal neighbors of color 1** (so one of the 4 directions is \u201cmissing\u201d a 1).\n   - The junction cell can be **1** or a **different color**.\n3. **Arrow direction**: if the missing-1 neighbor is, say, \u201cdown\u201d, the arrow points **up** (opposite the missing side).  \n   The arrow always goes through a 1-cell, so the **target** is **2 steps** from the junction in that direction.\n4. **Payload color** (the color \u201csent\u201d by the arrow):\n   - If the junction cell is **not 1**, the payload is that junction color.\n   - If the junction cell **is 1**, the payload is the **region color** it sits in (the only non-1 neighbor at the junction).\n5. Each arrow **recolors the entire target region** with its payload. After recoloring, all arrow pixels (the 1s and any special junction color) are filled with their containing region\u2019s final color (so **no 1 remains**).\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\nIn the test grid there are 8 large regions (colors): **9, 7, 3, 0, 6, 2, 4, 8** and 8 arrows, each pointing into one of these regions. Reading each arrow gives the final recoloring:\n\n- region **9 \u2192 3**\n- region **7 \u2192 9**\n- region **3 \u2192 8**\n- region **0 \u2192 2**\n- region **6 \u2192 0**\n- region **2 \u2192 6**\n- region **4 \u2192 8**\n- region **8 \u2192 0**\n\nThen we repaint the whole grid accordingly, and replace every arrow cell with its region\u2019s final color.\n\n---\n\n## Output

with \"1\" markers forming crack/cross patterns**\n2. **Small \"accent\" colors appear at 1-cross intersections (not the background color, not 1)**\n3. **The output creates clean rectangular regions where:**\n   - Accent colors expand to fill significant areas\n   - Background colors either form frames or are replaced\n   - The 1s are removed\n   - Relative spatial positions are maintained but simplified\n\nFor the test input, I identified:\n- **Main regions**: 3 (green, top), 0 (black, upper-middle), 2 (red, center), 6 (yellow, left), 4 (pink, right), 8 (cyan, bottom), 7 (orange, small upper-right)\n- **Key accents**: 8 at position ~(8,6) within the 0 region (has a 1-cross pattern), and 0 at position ~(28,12) near the 8 region boundary\n\nThe transformation:\n- The 8 accent in the 0 region means 8 expands there\n- The 0 accent near the bottom means 0 appears at the bottom\n- Other regions become clean rectangles maintaining their relative positions\n\n**Output (30\u00d730

Identification**: Each input contains multiple colored regions separated by boundaries (often marked with 1s)\n2. **Marker Detection**: Within some regions, there are small \"marker\" cells of different colors (non-1, non-background), often surrounded by 1s in cross-like patterns\n3. **Marker Swap**: The transformation swaps certain colors based on markers found - if region A contains marker color B, and region B contains marker color A, they swap positions\n4. **Cleanup**: The 1s (boundary markers) are removed and regions become clean rectangular blocks\n\nFor the test input:\n- Main regions: 3 (green), 0 (black), 2 (red), 6 (magenta), 4 (yellow), 7 (orange), 8 (cyan) with 9 as background\n- Key marker found: In region 0 (black), there's marker 8 (around row 8: \"1,8,1\" pattern)\n- In region 8 (cyan), there's marker 0 (around row 28-29)\n- This indicates a 0\u21948 color swap in their respective positions\n\nThe output creates clean rectangular blocks with:\n- 3

It looks like we're dealing with a grid-based puzzle where the key lies in understanding \"tiles,\" which are essentially solid-color rectangles, and how those rectangles interact with each other via directional \"arrows\" or markers. The goal is to figure out the output based on a series of examples and a test input.\n\nMy initial thought is this: the arrows are the conductors of colored \"payloads\" that move from one tile to another. The direction of the arrow determines the destination, and the tile's base color gets updated based on the payload. Some global rotations/transpositions might be involved.\n\nTo test this, let's dive into Example 1. After carefully examining the 16x12 grid and how it maps to a 12x16 output, I identified the rectangular regions and noticed distinct shapes that seem to be markers. By breaking down the top-left area, it was obvious we had a pattern: a T-shape or a plus-like shape within the \"tiles\" and used this pattern to understand the arrow direction. For each tile, I focused on the color of the central shape, and if it wasn't a one, it was the color that should be used as a payload. If the center was one, the base tile color was used. In Example 1, the transformation seemed to involve a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation because the output was the reverse of the input.\n\nMy focus shifted to identifying and mapping tiles, the payloads, and the impact of the arrows. I'm hypothesizing that the arrow pattern points in a specific direction (usually away from a vertical bar), and a color will get transferred. The puzzle involves calculating the final color of each tile.\n\nFor Example 1, I noticed something strange: the payload and the base color of the tile impacted the output. If two tiles merge, the color will transfer. I tried to generalize the rules, looking for patterns when tiles were modified in color. I carefully mapped out how colors propagated through the grid. The direction seems to be towards the \"missing\" side of the marker.\n\nAfter meticulously analyzing example 1, I shifted to a more general strategy:\n- Segmentation of a grid into tiles.\n- Identify the marker's structure.\n- Determine arrow payload based on arrow color.\n- Predict the transformations.\n\nI started applying this approach to a much larger test grid (30x30). The large grid made the previous analysis useful. I carefully identified a strategy to decompose the big test input into tiles. The test input had markers inside nested tiles. This was more complex, requiring multiple passes of understanding where colors spread.\n\nMy thought process then included the use of graphs and more sophisticated reasoning to understand how colors flowed within tiles. This required a new level of pattern-matching and generalization. The process took into account overlapping tiles and multiple arrow interactions. The final state was defined by the arrows and the flow of the colors.\n\nThe implementation details became crucial. I figured out a way to model the solution and predict the changes that happened.\n\n\nThe logic for determining the transformation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Segmentation**: The grid is segmented into rectangular regions of solid base colors. Small \"noise\" or interior details are ignored to determine the base color.\n2.  **Marker Detection**: \"Markers\" are patterns of `1`s (and sometimes a center pixel of another color) found within these regions. They act as directional arrows.\n    *   A \"T\" shape points in the direction of the \"missing\" arm (or away from the crossbar/towards the stem).\n        *   `|-` (vertical bar left, protrusion right) points **Right**.\n        *   `-|` (vertical bar right, protrusion left) points **Left**.\n        *   `_|_` (inverted T) points **Up**.\n        *   `T` (standard T) points **Down**.\n    *   A \"+\" (Plus) shape points in **All 4 Directions**.\n3.  **Payload Determination**:\n    *   If the center of the marker is `1`, the payload is the **Base Color** of the tile containing the marker.\n    *   If the center of the marker is NOT `1`, that center color is the payload.\n4.  **Interaction**:\n    *   The payload is \"fired\" into the adjacent tile(s) in the indicated direction(s).\n    *   The target tile changes its color to the payload color.\n    *   This can cause a chain reaction or simultaneous updates. (e.g., A targets B, B targets C).\n    *   In the test input, we have:\n        *   **Tile C (3s)**: Marker (Up) -> Payload 3 -> Targets **Top 9s**. Top 9s become **3**.\n        *   **Tile D/G (0s)**: Marker (Plus) -> Payload 0 -> Targets **Tile E (2s)** and **Tile F (6s)**. E and F become **0**.\n        *   **Tile E (2s)**: Marker (Up) -> Payload 2 -> Targets **Tile D (0s)**. D becomes **2**.\n        *   **Tile 9 (8s)**: Marker (Plus) -> Payload 8 -> Targets neighbors (**4s**, **Right/Bottom 9s**). They become **8**.\n        *   **Tile B (7s)**: No incoming, no outgoing. Stays **7**.\n        *   **Tile Left 9s**: No incoming.

First, I try to understand the core logic by looking at the problem description and examples. It seems like the inputs are composed of tiles with a main color and maybe some \"marker\" patterns in a contrasting color. These markers are critical because they seem to indicate a direction. The directional marker points to a neighboring tile. The direction is determined by the specific shape or position of the marker inside the tile. The \"Head\" or missing edge of the shape gives us the direction. A key point is that the marker triggers actions: a color transfer to the targeted neighbor.\n\nI carefully examine the examples, paying attention to the input and output. I check the dimensions and look for any transpositions or rotations. It seems that there are two distinct types of marker rules that can exist. One has the \"head\" pointing to the target cell (similar to an arrow), and the other has a \"missing edge\" of the shape telling the cell where to move to.\n\nIn Example 1, I worked out the marker shapes. One rule had the arrow pointing down, indicating the neighbor cell should be changed to the center cell color.\n\nI then built a hypothesis. 1) Segment the input grid into the main tiles. 2) I identify all markers and determine their directions. 3)  Based on the direction, find the neighboring tile and decide the action, which usually involves changing the neighbor's color. Then I construct the output by modifying tiles.\n\nThe problem got tricky in Example 1. I had trouble with the meaning of the markers and if the direction pointed to the target. It seems like the \"Head\" means the color is moved there. The Head of the Marker shape points in the direction of the arrow. This means 3 things: a) Marker Location, b) Color, and c) Direction, which must be interpreted to make a successful solution.\n\nIn the Test Input, I got a bit of an idea. It seems like the action is to find a boundary tile and change its color to match the marker's shape color. The process is to first find solid-colored tiles and make a grid. Then I will identify the tile borders and marker regions. I carefully identify these to get a solid direction for all actions. I will carefully identify the regions and make sure there are no other internal markers that may disrupt the solution.\n\nUltimately, I needed to check and recheck my rules against the examples to make sure they were consistently giving me the correct answers. Once I've verified the rules, I can apply them to the Test Input.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of colored tiles based on \"arrow\" markers formed by the color `1`. The transformation involves identifying these markers, determining the direction they point, and moving a payload color to the adjacent tile in that direction. The grid is then segmented and filled with the final colors.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution Logic:**\n\n1.  **Segmentation:**\n    The grid is composed of rectangular regions (tiles) of solid colors (ignoring small internal details). We identify these tiles in the Input:\n    -   **Tile A (Top Background):** Color `9`. Covers the top/left surrounding area.\n    -   **Tile B (Top-Center):** Color `3`. Large rectangular block inside the top `9` area.\n    -   **Tile C (Top-Right):** Color `7`. Small block in the top right corner.\n    -   **Tile D (Bottom-Left):** Color `6`. Block on the mid-to-bottom left.\n    -   **Tile E (Bottom-Center):** Color `2`. Block to the right of Tile D.\n    -   **Tile F (Right Strip):** Color `4`. Vertical strip on the right edge.\n    -   **Tile G (Bottom-Right):** Color `8`. Block in the bottom right corner.\n    -   **Tile H (Bottom Background):** Color `9`. Strip at the very bottom, below D, E, G.\n\n2.  **Marker Detection & Direction:**\n    Markers are patterns of `1`s centered around a pixel. The direction is determined by the \"head\" of the pattern (the side with a single pixel, or opposite the missing side of the cross).\n    -   **In Tile B (Color 3):** There is a marker at the top `(Row 2-3)`. The pattern has `1`s at Top, Left, Right relative to the center `1`. This shape corresponds to an arrow pointing **Up**.\n        -   **Action:** Tile B points to its neighbor above, **Tile A**.\n        -   **Payload:** Center is `1`, so payload is the tile's base color **3**.\n    -   **In Tile E (Color 2):** There are two markers.\n        1.  Top marker `(Row 9-10)`: `1`s at Top, Left, Right. Points **Up**.\n            -   **Action:** Tile E points to its neighbor above, **Tile B**.\n            -   **Payload:** Base color **2**.\n        2.  Left marker `(Row 20-22)`: `1`s at Top, Right, Bottom. Points **Left**.\n            -   **Action:** Tile E points to its neighbor to the left, **Tile D**.\n            -   **Payload:** Base color **2**.\n    -   **In Tile D (Color 6):** Marker at `(Row 17-18)`. `1`s at Left, Right, Bottom. Points **Down**.\n        -   **Action:** Tile D points to its neighbor below, **Tile H**.\n        -   **Payload:** Base color **6**.\n    -   **Other Tiles (A, C, F, G, H):** No valid directional markers found.\n\n3.  **Applying Transformations:**\n    -   **Tile A** receives color **3** from Tile B. (Old 9 -> New 3).\n    -   **Tile B** receives color **2** from Tile E. (Old 3 -> New 2).\n    -   **Tile D** receives color **2** from Tile E. (Old 6 -> New 2).\n    -   **Tile H** receives color **6** from Tile D. (Old 9 -> New 6).\n    -   **Tile E** has no incoming arrows, so it remains **2**.\n    -   **Tile C** remains **7**.\n    -   **Tile F** remains **4**.\n    -   **Tile G** remains **8**.\n\n4.  **Final Cleanup:**\n    -   Remove markers and fill tiles with their new colors.\n    -   Merge adjacent tiles of the same color (Tile B, D, E all become 2, forming a large central region).\n\n5.  **Global Transformation:**\n    -   Check input dimensions. The test input is square (30x30), so no global transpose is needed (consistent with Example 2 and 4).\n\n**Final Color Mapping:**\n-   Top area (was 9) -> **3**\n-   Top-Right (was 7) -> **7**\n-   Middle/Center area (was 3) -> **2**\n-   Bottom-Left (was 6) -> **2**\n-   Bottom-Center (was 2) -> **2**\n-   Right Edge (was 4) -> **4**\n-   Bottom-Right (was 8) -> **8**\n-   Bottom Edge (was 9)

(3, 7, 0, 2, 6, 4, 8) with 9 as background\n2. **Find arrow markers** (patterns of 1s) - These indicate directional color transfers\n3. **Determine payloads** - Either the arrow center color (if not 1) or the tile's base color\n4. **Apply transfers** - Colors get sent to adjacent tiles based on arrow directions\n\n**Key arrows identified in the test input:**\n- **3-tile (rows 2-3, col 14)**: T pointing DOWN, payload=3 \u2192 sends to 0-tile\n- **0-tile (rows 7-8, cols 5-7)**: Plus with 8 at center \u2192 sends 8 UP to 3-tile\n- **2-tile (rows 9-10, cols 13-15)**: T pointing UP, payload=2 \u2192 sends to 0-tile  \n- **6-tile (rows 20-22, col 12-13)**: Pointing RIGHT, payload=6 \u2192 sends to 2-tile\n- **8-tile (rows 25-26, cols 27-29)**: T pointing UP, payload=8 \u2192 sends to 4-tile\n- **8-tile (rows 27-29, col 12)**: Has 0 at center \u2192 sends 0 LEFT to 6-tile\n\n**Color transformations based on transfers:**\n- 3 receives 8 (from 0's arrow), sends 3 \u2192 becomes **8**\n- 0 receives 3 (from 3), receives 2 (from 2) \u2192 becomes **3**\n- 2 receives 6 (from 6) \u2192 becomes **6**\n- 6 receives 0 (from 8's 0-center arrow) \u2192 becomes **0**\n- 4 receives 8 (from 8) \u2192 becomes **8**\n- 7, 8, 9 stay unchanged\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n9,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n

It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
