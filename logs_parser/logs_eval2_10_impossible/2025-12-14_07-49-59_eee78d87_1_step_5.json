            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment & Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the task is to predict the output of an ARC problem based on a few examples. The core of the problem seems to be transforming a small 6x6 input grid into a larger 16x16 output grid. The outputs are always a 16x16 grid, and there are three solved examples. The key to the problem must be understanding the relationship between the small input and big output.\n\n**Example Analysis**\n\nThe examples show a pattern, with the background always being color 7. The inputs have small, uniquely shaped objects, with the corresponding output being a larger, structured image. Initially, I thought it was zooming but quickly realized it\u2019s more complex, as the outputs include a new color (9) not in the input.\n\n**Key Observations and Hypotheses**\n\n*   **Size Expansion:** The jump from 6x6 to 16x16 suggests some kind of tiling, replication or interpolation process.\n*   **Color 9:** The introduction of color 9 in the output is crucial, signifying a \"highlight\" or modification.\n*   **Grid Structure:** The outputs display a clear grid-like structure, but it's not a simple tiling. It's more complex, with variations depending on the input shape.\n*   **3x3 Subgrid:** After looking at several cases, it seems that there is a relevant 3x3 pattern inside the 6x6 input to make the output.\n\n**The Grid Structure**\n\nA detailed analysis of the output grid reveals it\u2019s a 5x5 array of blocks with single-pixel separators. These blocks are of size 2x2. The central 3x3 array is modified, whereas the rest of the array is simple. The pattern inside this center part seems related to the input shape.\n\n**Defining the Rules**\n\nThe goal is to understand how the 3x3 input pattern transforms into this 16x16 output. It's not a direct pixel-by-pixel mapping.\n\n1.  **Extract the Core:** The starting point is extracting a 3x3 subgrid from the input. It corresponds to the non-background pixels.\n\n2.  **Define a Base Grid**: An important point is to discover what the underlying output grid looks like. The idea is that it can be created and then modified according to the input. We will use the \u201cfundamental tile\u201d. This tile is the pattern for the lines and the blocks.\n\n3.  **Rotation Logic** The next hypothesis is that it could be used for the base grid. The base grid is constructed using a \u201cFundamental Tile\u201d of the top-left 2x2 of the Input Pattern, we also know that the FG is translated to 0 and the BG to 7. This base grid could be built by applying the rules:\n    *   Map the 2x2 input with 7=BG, FG=0.\n    *   Rotate the result 180 degrees.\n    *   The 2x2 grid then describes how to make the entire grid.\n\n4.  **Overlay Highlight:** The \"highlighting\" with color 9 is not random; it's a structural modification, so any 0 is replaced by a 9 in the center, and 7 stays unchanged. The core of the output is a \u201c0\u201d everywhere and 7 on the \u201clines\u201d, the highlight just replaces it.\n\n**Test Input**\n\nWith these rules in hand, all examples should be easily processed. By taking the test input, identifying a 3x3 square, then extracting the top-left 2x2. We can get the fundamental tile with the above logic.\n\n\nThe solution involves generating a 16x16 output grid based on a 3x3 pattern extracted from the input grid. The process determines a repeating \"Base Grid\" pattern and then applies a specific \"Overlay\" in the center.\n\n**1. Pattern Extraction**\nFirst, we identify the bounding box of the non-background pixels (non-7) in the 6x6 input grid.\nFor the **Test Input**, the non-7 pixels (color 2) are at `(0,2), (0,4), (2,2), (2,4)`.\nThis forms a 3x3 pattern `P` (Rows 0-2, Cols 2-4):\n```\n2 7 2\n7 7 7\n2 7 2\n```\nThe background is 7, and the foreground is 2.\n\n**2. Determining the Fundamental Tile**\nWe derive a 2x2 \"Fundamental Tile\" `T` from the **Top-Left 2x2** subgrid of the extracted pattern `P`.\nInput Top-Left 2x2:\n```\n2 7\n7 7\n```\nMap the colors to a binary scheme: Foreground (2) becomes `0`, Background (7) becomes `7`.\n```\n0 7\n7 7\n```\nRotate this 2x2 block by **180 degrees** to get `T`:\n```\n7 7\n7 0\n```\nSo, the components of `T` are:\n*   `T(0,0) = 7` (Intersection)\n*   `T(0,1) = 7` (Horizontal Line segment)\n*   `T(1,0) = 7` (Vertical Line segment)\n*   `T(1,1) = 0` (Block content)\n\n**3. Generating the Base Grid**\nWe construct a 16x16 grid. The grid structure consists of 1-pixel wide lines separating 2x2 blocks. Indices `0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15` correspond to \"Line\" rows/columns (index % 3 == 0). The other indices correspond to \"Block\" rows/columns.\nThe value of a pixel at `(r, c)` is determined by `T(r_type, c_type)`:\n*   `r_type = 0` if `r % 3 == 0`, else `1`.\n*   `c_type = 0` if `c % 3 == 0`, else `1`.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n*   **Intersections** (`r%3==0, c%3==0`): `T(0,0) = 7`\n*   **Horizontal Lines** (`r%3==0, c%3!=0`): `T(0,1) = 7`\n*   **Vertical Lines** (`r%3!=0, c%3==0`): `T(1,0) = 7`\n*   **Blocks** (`r%3!=0, c%3!=0`): `T(1,1) = 0`\n\nThis results in a grid of `0` blocks (2x2) separated by a complete lattice of `7`s.\nExample Row 0 (Line): `7, 7, 7, 7...` (All 7s)\nExample Row 1 (Block): `7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7...`\n\n**4. Applying the Overlay**\nA \"Highlight\" overlay is applied to the central region of the grid, specifically indices `5` to `10` (inclusive) for both rows and columns.\nRule: In this region, replace any pixel with value `0` with `9` (Maroon). Pixels with value `7` remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Rows 5, 7, 8, 10** are Block rows. The pattern is `...7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7...`\n    *   Indices 5-10: `0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0`.\n    *   Apply replacement: `9, 7, 9, 9, 7, 9`.\n*   **Rows 6, 9** are Line rows. The pattern is all `7`s.\n    *   No `0`s to replace. They remain all `7`s.\n\n**Final Output Construction:**\n*   **Rows 0, 3, 12, 15:** All `7`s.\n*   **Rows 6, 9:** All `7`s (Unchanged by overlay).\n*   **Rows 1, 2, 4, 11, 13, 14:** `7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7`.\n*   **Rows 5, 7, 8, 10:** `7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 9, 7, 9, 9, 7, 9, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7`.\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's what I've figured out about this ARC task, step-by-step:**\n\nFirst off, the user wants me to crack this ARC puzzle.  Got it. Let's dig in. I'm seeing 6x6 input grids and bigger output grids. The input mostly has orange (7) with some other colored patterns.  I noticed the output seems to be this repeating tiling of larger grids.\n\nI'm starting to see that the output is always 16x16 and it's built of these 2x2 \"cells\" and 1-pixel-wide gaps. The 0s create the grid. There's a 5x5 array of 2x2 tiles. The inputs don't line up neatly with the output tile size. Noted, need to figure out the connection between 6x6 input and 5x5 tile array.\n\nThe input patterns aren't just random. They've got these specific shapes or patterns of colors. Green (3) is a plus, blue (1) an H-shape, and magenta (6) an X shape.  The test input is a square of red (2).\n\nNow, the output isn't a direct scaling of the input pattern. The 9s show up in this specific 5x5 region. The number 9 becomes key because it creates that highlight within the output. The background pattern in each example is something different.\n\nThere's this hypothesis that the 6x6 input is being mapped to a 5x5 tile array. The 6x6 input is not the same as the 5x5 output.  The output might be representing local neighborhoods of these \"special color\" shapes. Let's use the term *intrusion color* when referring to the non-orange pixels.\n\nI got curious about the *structure* of the output and how that related to the input grid. I had this idea that maybe the pixel values in the input are being \"blown up\", but the size mismatch, 6x6 and 16x16 doesn't quite work. I did notice that the outputs are either filled with all \"7\" or black with orange separators.\n\nIt appears the background or texture of each output is related to a property of the input.  One hypothesis. The texture of the output is determined by the \"intrusion color\", that's interesting.\n\nThe outputs have the central grid area (Indices 5-10) is always highlighted.  I'm calling the central highlighted block the \"9-box\". It seems the intrusion color determines *something* about the structure.\n\nA hypothesis is that the output grids represent the \"walls\" of a 5x5 grid or the intersections of those lines. This makes me consider a coordinate-based interpretation of the grid. It's like a lattice structure. The pattern of 7s and 0s relates to some pattern or code, related to `mod 3`.\n\nI had to backtrack.  I was trying to map each 3x3 input pattern onto a cell in the output and I just wasn't making it work.\n\nThe color (3) -> Background texture is based on the logic: if `x%3==0`, pixel is 0, else 7.  The texture is then applied to the output.\n\nThere seems to be an underlying structure based on the color's numerical value and the logic gate structure to define the background texture. These are: `!SepX && !SepY` and `SepX|SepY`, `SepX^SepY`, where I define `SepX` as the rows that are \"Separator\" rows and `SepY` as the Columns which are \"Separator\".\n\nColors -> Textures. Colors might map to a logic gate. A truth table. I need to figure out this connection between the color (3,1,6,2) and the logic (AND, OR, XOR). If the input texture is XOR, I use all 0s for the tiles and I draw in 7s around a grid shape.\n\nAfter lots of testing and hypotheses, I'm thinking the colors encode a 4-bit integer, which can be interpreted as a truth table. Then I define that the *logic* of the output depends on whether the 2D grid coordinate has its x and y coordinate, modulus 3, as a \"separator\" or \"cell\".\n\nThe color number encodes an output pattern according to the state (Sep/Cell, Sep/Cell) and the output is then encoded in the final pixel value.\n\n*   1 (Blue) translates to OR. `0111`.\n*   6 (Magenta) is XOR (0110).\n*   3 (Green) to the bitmask with value 3 (0011).\n\nThe final\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid.\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation involves the following logic:\n\n1.  **Output Structure:** The 16x16 output grid represents a 5x5 grid of 2x2 \"cells\" separated by 1-pixel wide lines (separators).\n    *   Separators are at indices $x, y \\in \\{0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15\\}$.\n    *   Cells are at the indices between separators.\n    *   The \"coordinates\" of a pixel $(r, c)$ can be described by whether it falls on a separator or in a cell. Let $S_r = (r \\% 3 == 0)$ and $S_c = (c \\% 3 == 0)$.\n\n2.  **Background Texture:** The input grid contains a pattern of a specific color (other than orange/7) against an orange background. This \"intrusion color\" determines the background texture of the output grid.\n    *   The texture is defined by a logic function determining whether a pixel is orange (7) or black (0).\n    *   **Example 1 (Color 3 - Green):** The texture corresponds to Pattern 1 where only pixels that are *inside cells* (both row and column are not separators) are orange.\n        *   Logic: $7$ if $(!S_r \\land !S_c)$, else $0$.\n        *   Mapping: Color 3 $\\to$ Truth Table Logic.\n    *   **Example 2 (Color 1 - Blue):** The texture corresponds to Pattern 2 where any pixel on a *separator* line is orange.\n        *   Logic: $7$ if $(S_r \\lor S_c)$, else $0$.\n        *   Mapping: Color 1 $\\to$ Logic 7 ($0111_2$). (Matches OR).\n    *   **Example 3 (Color 6 - Magenta):** The texture corresponds to Pattern 3 where pixels are orange if exactly one coordinate is a separator (lines crossing cells, but not intersections).\n        *   Logic: $7$ if $(S_r \\oplus S_c)$, else $0$.\n        *   Mapping: Color 6 $\\to$ Logic 6 ($0110_2$). (Matches XOR).\n    *   **Test Input (Color 2 - Red):** Following the pattern where even colors map to their integer value as a truth table (e.g., $6 \\to 6$), and odd colors map to something else, we infer Color 2 maps to Logic 2 ($0010_2$).\n        *   Logic 2 means the output is 7 only when state is $01_2$ (i.e., $S_r=0, S_c=1$? Or $S_r=1, S_c=0$?).\n        *   Based on consistency with other mappings, the state index is formed by $(S_c \\ll 1) | S_r$ or vice versa.\n            *   For Color 6 (XOR), order doesn't matter.\n            *   For Color 1 (OR), order doesn't matter.\n            *   For Color 3 ($!S_r \\land !S_c$), this is state 00 being 1.\n        *   If Color 2 implies Logic 2 ($0010_2$), only index 1 is high. Assuming index 1 corresponds to $S_r=1, S_c=0$ (Separator Rows, Cell Columns), the pattern creates horizontal orange lines within the separator rows. The intersections ($11$) are black, and cell interiors ($00$) are black.\n\n3.  **Center Highlight (The 9-Box):**\n    *   In all examples, a 6x6 region in the center of the output grid (Rows 5-10, Cols 5-10) is highlighted.\n    *   This region corresponds to the central 2x2 cell of the 5x5 block grid and its surrounding separators.\n    *   **Rule:** Inside this region, any pixel that would be Black (0) according to the background texture is replaced with Maroon (9). Pixels that are Orange (7) remain Orange.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Input Color:** 2 (Red).\n*   **Background Logic:** Horizontal Orange Lines on Separator Rows.\n    *   Separator Rows (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15): Pattern `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, ...`\n    *   Cell Rows (others): Pattern `0, 0, 0, 0, ...`\n*   **Applying 9-Box Overlay (Rows 5-10, Cols 5-10):**\n    *   **Row 5 (Cell Row):** Base is all 0s. 9-box columns (5-10) become 9.\n        *   `0,0,0,0,0, 9,9,9,9,9,9, 0,0,0,0,0`\n    *   **Row 6 (Separator Row):** Base is `0, 7,7, 0, 7,7, 0, 7,7...`\n        *   Indices 5-10 are `7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7`.\n        *   Replace 0s with 9s: `7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7`.\n        *   Full Row: `0,7,7,0,7, 7,9,7,7,9,7, 0,7,7,0`\n    *   **Rows 7, 8 (Cell Rows):** Same as Row 5.\n    *   **Row 9 (Separator Row):** Same as Row 6.\n    *   **Row 10 (Cell Row):** Same as Row 5.\n\nThe resulting grid is constructed based on this logic.\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the following transformation rules:\n\n1. **Input Analysis**: The 6x6 input contains a 3x3 pattern made with a non-7 color. This pattern determines both the base tiling and the 9 placement in a 16x16 output.\n\n2. **Base Tile Pattern**: The 16x16 output is tiled with a 3x3 pattern derived from the shape:\n   - If the shape's vertical edges (middle row left/right) are filled \u2192 row 0 of tile is all 0s; otherwise (0,7,7)\n   - If the shape's horizontal edges (middle column top/bottom) are filled \u2192 col 0 of tile is all 0s; otherwise (0,7,7)\n   - If the shape's corners are filled \u2192 content cells (1-2, 1-2) are 0s; otherwise 7s\n\n3. **9 Placement**: The shape is scaled to a 3x3 region centered in the 5x5 cell grid. 9s mark:\n   - Inner corners of filled cells (closest to center)\n   - Separator intersections where 2+ adjacent cells are filled\n   - Paths connecting filled cells through filled center regions\n\n**Test Input Analysis**:\nThe 2s form a pattern at rows 0-2, cols 2-4:\n```\n1 0 1\n0 0 0\n1 0 1\n```\n(corners only, center and edges empty)\n\n**Tile determination**:\n- Vertical edges empty \u2192 tile row 0 = (0,7,7)\n- Horizontal edges empty \u2192 tile col 0 = (0,7,7)  \n- Corners filled \u2192 tile content = 0\n\nThis gives tile:\n```\n0 7 7\n7 0 0\n7 0 0\n```\n\n**9 positions**: Since there's no center and corners are isolated (no 2+ adjacent filled cells at any separator intersection), 9s only appear at the inner corners of the four filled cells: (5,5), (5,10), (10,5), (10,10).\n\n```\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,0,0,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,0,0,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n```",

For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Expert Analysis and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out about this task: the goal is to transform a small input grid into a larger, patterned output.  The key is to understand the connection between the input's foreground shape and the output's structure. It's not a direct pixel-to-pixel mapping, but a more sophisticated pattern generation rule.\n\nHere's how my mind's working:\n\n1.  **Input Dissection**: I'm seeing a consistent pattern.  There's a background color (usually orange, or 7), and a foreground shape made of another color.  The input's size is always 6x6.  I'm looking for the essential form of the shape. I realized that the actual coordinates of this shape within the 6x6 grid don't *really* matter.\n\n2.  **Output Analysis:** The output is always 16x16, and much more structured.  It looks like a grid of 2x2 orange blocks separated by black borders, with the maroon color creating a distinct pattern around a central region. Crucially, the maroon color *isn't* directly derived from the input's foreground color.  It's a new, key element. I also found out that the colors in the example outputs were possibly flipped in the prompt descriptions, so I will trust my visual observation of the images.\n\n3.  **The Central Pattern:** The outputs always had the maroon section in the *center* of the 16x16 grid. It's a \"target lock\" or focus, a distinctive frame. This indicates re-centering of the shape: the exact position of the input shape in its 6x6 grid is irrelevant. This is a critical observation!\n\n4.  **The Shape's Influence:** I discovered that the maroon pattern is a fixed box around the output's center, creating the distinctive hashtag or frame. The input shape, seems to define a 3x3 logical pattern, but its exact details are less important and it will not shift the resulting maroon frame. It appears that the shape determines the \"window\" color.\n\n5.  **The Algorithm's Logic:**\n    *   **Standard Output:** The algorithm seems to construct a fixed, standard 16x16 output grid.\n    *   **Baseline:**  Create the grid, and populate the blocks of orange in a 5x5 array of blocks.\n    *   **Overlay:** Then, the 9 pattern is laid out with its vertical bars in Cols 6 and 9 from Rows 5 to 10 and horizontal bars in Rows 6 and 9 from Cols 5 to 10.\n    *   **Shape:** If a shape is present it may change the border color, or \"window\" color of some of the central orange blocks.\n    * **Test input:** Re-center to apply the standard output with a 2x2 \"red\" window.\n    So, it seems that there's not a lot of specific shape analysis to do, and the answer is the constant pattern with shape input color determining some of its details.\n\n**The Solution:**\nI will focus on generating the \"standard\" output grid (the maroon-framed, orange-block structure) as described above. The color of the central block (The \"Window\") depends on the input shape. All the rest stays fixed.\n\n\nThe transformation converts the input grid into a stylized 16x16 output pattern.\nThe logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The output is always a 16x16 grid representing a 5x5 array of \"blocks\".\n    -   Each block is a 2x2 square of pixels.\n    -   Blocks are separated by 1-pixel wide borders (black, color 0).\n    -   The default block color is Orange (7).\n    -   The borders are initially Black (0).\n\n2.  **Pattern Overlay**: A specific pattern in Maroon (9) is overlaid onto the center of the grid. This pattern is consistent across all examples, regardless of the specific shape in the input (cross, H, X), acting as a \"framing\" or \"focus\" effect on the central block.\n    -   The overlay consists of a rectangular frame enclosing the central block (Block at row 2, col 2 in the 1-based 5x5 block grid).\n    -   The frame aligns with the borders surrounding the central block but is \"thickened\" to extend 1 pixel into the adjacent blocks along the cardinal directions.\n    -   Specifically, the maroon pixels are placed at:\n        -   **Horizontal Lines**: Rows 6 and 9.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The Enigma of ARC: Unveiling the Hidden Rules**\n\nAlright, let's dive into these ARC puzzles. My initial observation is that we're dealing with small input grids (6x6) that transform into much larger output grids (16x16). The inputs use color 7 as a base and another color to form a shape, while the outputs appear to be zoomed-in or tiled versions of the input, with intriguing structural alterations.\n\nLet's dissect Example 1. We have a green plus sign against an orange background. The output is a larger grid, and it looks like a 5x5 grid of 2x2 blocks separated by single-pixel black lines.\n\nNow, let's focus on those output \"blocks.\" Most are just orange, but the center has a reddish, almost maroon, pattern. Analyzing this, it looks like a \"hash\" shape, and its position seems linked to the original green plus in the input.\n\nMy first thought was a direct pixel-to-pixel mapping. But that quickly crumbles. The input's 6x6 doesn't neatly align with the output's 5x5 grid. And the maroon shape's position isn't directly tied to the input plus's position.\n\nAfter more contemplation, I realized that the input is *defining* the output. It defines the grid's structure. If we look at the intersection points, the input pixels relate to the intersections of the 16x16 grid at intervals of three. It's like the input is a sketch for the grid.\n\nBut what *exactly* is the role of the shape in the input? Let's consider Example 2: a blue 'H' becomes a red, almost rectangular shape in the output. The 'H' seems to become a central area surrounded by lines.\n\nThis led me to the concept of **connectivity**.\n\nI'm starting to think the key lies in the \"walls\". When a shape is closed, it might turn into a solid, filled region in the output. If it's a series of points or diagonal, it might become something else.\n\nThis seems to be the crucial shift in perspective. If a shape is a filled, compact form, maybe it leads to a filled center. If it is sparse, like a collection of points, it might only result in corners.\n\nWhat about a test input? Now, we have a square of four points. Is it connected?\n\nHere, let's review the outputs and their grid lines. Ex. 1 had solid black lines. Ex 2/3 had dotted/dashed borders.\n\nI've finally started seeing a pattern! Input Shapes -> Output Features. A shape made of points becomes corners, a \"connected\" shape fills a center or creates a frame! I believe the connectivity of the input shapes is the key.\n\nSo for the new test, since there are no connections, the Output should resemble Ex. 3 and the output will contain \"Corners\" in the central cell, and the grid lines will be dashed.\n\nThis leads me to predict that for the test input with a hollow box of points, the result will be a dashed grid with four reddish dots at the corners of the central cell, same as in example 3.\n\nLet's construct:\n\nThe output is a 16x16, built by a repeating pattern:\n\n-   Rows that are divisible by 3 are dashed lines: 0 7 7 0 7 7...\n\n-   Other rows are black/blank cells: 7 0 0 7 0 0 ...\n\nFinally, let's account for the corners! We just place the color 9 at the intersection (6,6), (6,9), (9,6), and (9,9) where the dashed gridlines are intersecting.\n\nAnd that's the output! 4 isolated dots! This feels robust, so let's check.\n\n\nThe problem requires transforming a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid.\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Output Structure**: The output is a 5x5 grid of 2x2 cells, separated by 1-pixel wide grid lines. This results in a total size of $5 \\times 2 + 6 \\times 1 = 16$.\n    *   **Grid Lines**: These are at rows and columns 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n    *   **Cells**: These are at rows/cols (1,2), (4,5), (7,8), (10,11), (13,14).\n\n2.  **Base Pattern (Grid Style)**:\n    *   Example 1 (Plus shape, active edges) produces a solid black grid with orange cells.\n    *   Example 2 (H shape, active corners) and Example 3 (X shape, active corners) produce a \"dashed\" grid with black cells.\n    *   **Dashed Grid Rule**:\n        *   Cells are filled with black (0).\n        *   Grid lines are dashed: intersection points are black (0), and segments between intersections are orange (7).\n    *   The **Test Input** has a shape consisting of 4 dots forming a large square (corners active). It lacks connected edges (inactive mids). This connectivity resembles Example 3 (disconnected points). Therefore, the Test Output will use the **Dashed Grid** style with **Black Cells**.\n\n3.  **Output Features (Red Shape)**:\n    *   The shape in the output is always centered, regardless of the input shape's position.\n    *   The form of the red (9) shape depends on the geometry of the input shape within its bounding box (treated as a 3x3 pattern):\n        *   **Center Pixel**: If active (like in Ex 2, 3), it can affect the center cell. However, Ex 3 showed that a center pixel leads to a filled center with 'spills'. The Test Input has an inactive center (background 7). This implies the center cell in the output will remain empty (black).\n        *   **Corners**: Active corners in the input (like in Ex 3) map to active **intersection points** around the center cell in the output. The Test Input has active corners (2s at the corners of the shape).\n        *   **Edges**: Active edges in the input map to active grid line segments. The Test Input has inactive edges.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The Test Output will feature 4 red dots (9) at the intersections surrounding the central cell (indices (6,6), (6,9), (9,6), (9,9)). The rest of the grid will follow the base dashed pattern.\n\n**Generated Output Description:**\n*   **Grid Lines (Rows 0, 3, 6...)**: Pattern `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7...` (Black intersection, Orange segment).\n*   **Cell Rows (Rows 1, 2, 4...)**: Pattern `7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0...` (Orange vertical segment, Black cell body).\n*   **Features**: Pixels at (6,6), (6,9), (9,6), (9,9) are set to 9 (Maroon).\n\noutput:\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

The unit pattern depends on the shape's characteristics:\n- Position (0,0) of shape determines if corners are filled\n- The unit pattern follows specific rules based on shape[0][0] and shape[1][0]\n\n**Step 3: Grid unit determination**\n- If shape[0][0]=0: Grid row 0 and col 0 are all 0s, interior (1-2, 1-2) is 7s\n- If shape[0][0]=1 and shape[1][0]=1: Grid row 0 is 0s, col 0 has 7s at rows 1-2\n- If shape[0][0]=1 and shape[1][0]=0: Both row 0 and col 0 have 7s at positions 1-2\n\n**Step 4: 9s overlay**\nThe 9s appear in a centered 6\u00d76 region (rows 5-10, cols 5-10), replacing 0s at grid line positions where the shape is colored.\n\n## Applying to Test Input\n\nThe test input has 2s at positions forming this 3\u00d73 shape pattern:\n```\n1 0 1\n0 0 0\n1 0 1\n```\n(Four corners pattern)\n\n- shape[0][0]=1 and shape[1][0]=0 \u2192 Grid unit is:\n```\n0 7 7\n7 0 0\n7 0 0\n```\n\nThe 9s mark the four corners of the centered region, replacing 0s at:\n- (5,5), (5,10), (6,6), (6,9), (9,6), (9,9), (10,5), (10,10)\n\n## Output\n\n```\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,0,0,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,0,0,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n```",

Apply the \u201cweave\u201d permutation: **swap rows 2\u21943 and 4\u21945**, and do the same for columns.\n   (Equivalently, reorder indices `[1,3,2,5,4,6]` for both rows and columns.)\n3. Place this 6\u00d76 into the **center** of the 16\u00d716 output: rows **6\u201311**, cols **6\u201311**.\n4. Wherever the motif has `1`, write `9` on top of the background.\n\nFor this test, that produces `9`s on rows 6,8,9,11 and columns 6,8,9,11.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid (16\u00d716)\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analyzing the transformation:**\n\n1. **Output size**: All outputs are 16\u00d716 grids (from 6\u00d76 inputs)\n\n2. **Grid structure**: The output has a lattice/frame with separators at positions where row%3=0 or col%3=0, creating a 5\u00d75 arrangement of 2\u00d72 tiles.\n\n3. **Base pattern determination**: The pattern of 0s and 7s depends on the motif's shape. Looking at the normalized 3\u00d73 motif mask:\n   - If motif[0,0]=0: Pattern 1 (0 at separators, 7 in content)\n   - If motif[0,0]=1 and motif[1,0]=1: Pattern 2 (0 at separator rows; 7 at separator cols in content rows; 0 in content)\n   - If motif[0,0]=1 and motif[1,0]=0: Pattern 3 (7 when exactly one of row%3=0 or col%3=0; 0 otherwise)\n\n4. **Motif handling**: The 3\u00d73 motif is tiled 2\u00d72 and placed centrally (rows 5-10, cols 5-10), colored red (9).\n\n**Applying to test input:**\n\nTest input motif (at rows 0-2, cols 2-4):\n```\n2 7 2\n7 7 7\n2 7 2\n```\n\nNormalized mask:\n```\n1 0 1\n0 0 0  \n1 0 1\n```\n\nSince motif[0,0]=1 and motif[1,0]=0 \u2192 **Pattern 3** (checkerboard-like)\n\nThe motif tiled 2\u00d72:\n```\nX .

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing and Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with solving an ARC problem based on three examples and a test input. It looks like I need to analyze the input and output grids to figure out the underlying logic.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** I see a 6x6 input grid with an orange background (color 7) and a green plus-sign shape (made of color 3) in the bottom right corner. The output is a 16x16 grid with a repeating pattern. The hint about a \"black lattice\" is important. It implies the output is based on a structured grid with black separators. The example output is clearly a 5x5 grid of something, and it's surrounded by solid black horizontal and vertical lines. The output values (0,7,9) are key.\n*   **Grid Structure:** The output seems to expand each input cell into a larger block. The output is 16x16 and the input is 6x6. Something is happening, but it's not a direct scale. It is a 2x2 with separation. It seems like the output is built from 2x2 tiles separated by 1-pixel-wide lines.\n*   **Repeating Pattern:** The output grid has a 5x5 grid structure, which the values are in 2x2 blocks separated by 1-pixel wide lines. Example 1 shows where the \"maroon\" values are: specifically at (2,2) and the corresponding sides.\n*   **Coordinate System:** I see how the shape is translated into coordinates and the output format. I need to figure out what happens in relation to the center pixel.\n\n**Deductions:**\n\n*   **Lattice:** The key is the \"black lattice/frame\" hint. It seems the input cells are mapped to larger, 2x2 blocks in the output, and these blocks are separated by black lines. In the first example, I realized that the value of black changes to red (9).\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   The \"motif\" (the green plus-sign) seems to be related to specific tiles and grid locations.\n    *   The output structure is clear, and it is a central 5x5 array.\n    *   The values of the tile are either 7 (orange), 0 (black).\n    *   This red is related to the input shape.\n    *   The pattern on the output appears to be the motif centered and red.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   The input has a blue 'H' shape (color 1), and the output has a different structure.\n    *   The background pattern is no longer all 7. It's now 7 and 0s.\n    *   The red section appears to correspond to the H structure in some way.\n    *   The lattice is 7 in this case.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input has magenta (color 6) dots arranged as a five.\n    *   The basic structure is there, but the rows are now different. The same base is present.\n    *   It seems the lattice is horizontal and vertical (0), and in the first example, they are all zero. Here (0) are replaced by the tiles (0).\n*   **Test Input:** The test input has a red '2' (in the corner of the shape).\n*   In the three examples, all 7 become the background with a texture (0,0).\n*   Ex 1: `000 / 077 / 077`\n*   Ex 2: `000 / 700 / 700`\n*   Ex 3: `077 / 700 / 700`\n\n**Inference:**\n* I think the background pattern depends on the motif color.\n* Texture is what defines how to construct the output grid.\n* It depends on the number (color) or the shape.\n\n**Hypothesis and Plan:**\n\n*   The output is built with a black lattice pattern.\n*   The lattice is the horizontal and vertical black lines, and the tiles are orange (color 7) or, in the next steps, the color that the motif is normalized.\n*   The Motif will always appear as Red (normalized).\n*   The pattern of horizontal and vertical bars may differ.\n*   I will test by constructing the grids.\n*   The lattice is defined for each example based on a rule.\n\n**The Test Case:**\n\n*   The test input has four corner dots.\n*   The lattice and tile are defined:\n    *   Rows\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples and the hints provided, here is the reasoning for the solution:\n\n1.  **Grid Structure Transformation**:\n    *   The input is a 6x6 grid, and the output is a 16x16 grid.\n    *   The output grid represents a **5x5 layout of tiles**.\n    *   Each tile in the output is a **2x2 block of pixels**.\n    *   The tiles are separated by **1-pixel wide lines** (the \"lattice\").\n    *   This accounts for the size: (5 tiles * 2 pixels) + (6 separators * 1 pixel) = 16 pixels.\n    *   The base pattern (background) consists of **Orange (7) tiles** separated by a **Black (0) lattice**. This matches the hint: \"turning the orange background into separated orange tiles with black separators.\"\n\n2.  **Motif Extraction and Normalization**:\n    *   The input grid contains a \"motif\" distinguished by a non-orange color (e.g., Green 3, Blue 1, Magenta 6, Red 2).\n    *   The motif forms a shape within a 3x3 area.\n    *   In the output, this 3x3 motif shape is **centered** on the 5x5 tile grid. The center of the motif maps to the center tile of the output (Tile at row 2, column 2).\n    *   The motif's original color in the input is ignored; in the output, the motif is represented using **Red (9)**.\n\n3.  **Applying the Motif to the Output**:\n    *   The visual representation of the motif in the output appears to correlate with the input motif's shape and/or color.\n    *   However, the most consistent interpretation compatible with the \"Test Input\" (which has the color Red 2) is that the motif pixels are directly mapped to the corresponding **tiles** in the output grid, filling them with the normalized color Red (9).\n    *   **Test Input Motif**: The input shows Red (2) pixels at `(0,2), (0,4), (2,2), (2,4)`. This forms the **4 corners** of a 3x3 block centered at `(1,3)`.\n    *   **Mapping**: Centering this 3x3 block on the output's 5x5 grid (centered at tile `(2,2)`), the motif corresponds to the tiles at the corners of the central 3x3 area:\n        *   Top-Left: Tile `(1,1)`\n        *   Top-Right: Tile `(1,3)`\n        *   Bottom-Left: Tile `(3,1)`\n        *   Bottom-Right: Tile `(3,3)`\n    *   **Transformation**: We generate the base grid (Black lattice, Orange tiles) and then turn the tiles at indices `(1,1)`, `(1,3)`, `(3,1)`, and `(3,3)` into **Red (9)** tiles.\n\n4.  **Constructing the Output Grid**:\n    *   **Lattice Rows**: Rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 are all `0` (Black).\n    *   **Lattice Columns**: Columns 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 are all `0` (Black).\n    *   **Default Tiles**: All 2x2 tile areas are filled with `7` (Orange).\n    *   **Motif Tiles**: The specific tiles identified above are filled with `9` (Red).\n        *   Tile `(1,1)` spans Rows 4-5, Cols 4-5.\n        *   Tile `(1,3)` spans Rows 4-5, Cols 10-11.\n        *   Tile `(3,1)` spans Rows 10-11, Cols 4-5.\n        *   Tile `(3,3)` spans Rows 10-11, Cols 10-11.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,9,9,0,7,7,0,9,9,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,9,9,0,7,7,0,9,9,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,9,9,0,7,7,0,9,9,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,9,9,0,7,7,0,9,9,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this ARC task:**\n\nI've got to transform input grids into output grids following some rules I need to figure out. I'm seeing three examples, and the goal is to generalize and apply what I learn to a test input. I'm focusing on the structural relationships between the inputs and outputs.\n\nI know I'm dealing with grids of numbers.  Orange (7) seems to be background, and whatever isn't orange is the \"motif\". The hint says the output has a black lattice (which I can see) and the motif's shape should be preserved, but the colors are normalized to red.  Hmm, I need to check the examples for all of that. Also, the motif position isn't exactly kept; it's being normalized.\n\nMy first thought is to understand the color mappings. I need to make sure I know which number represents which color to properly interpret the examples. I'm taking notes on the grid dimensions and trying to get a feel for how the input size relates to the output.\n\nNow, I'm carefully examining the first example.  I'm trying to identify the motif shape in the input. In the output, I'm trying to see if there's any consistent pattern. It looks like the motif is scaled up into a 5x5 grid, and the motif itself seems to be mapped onto this 5x5 grid in a consistent way. I'm taking notes on what's active in the output grid. I'm paying extra attention to the colors and how they map from the input to the output.\n\nI'm getting closer to a basic understanding. The output is a larger grid with a structural pattern\u2014it's a grid of 2x2 blocks separated by 1-pixel-wide lines.  It looks like the 3x3 input shape is represented within the 5x5 grid.  Now, I have to figure out the rule. I'm starting to think the 5x5 grid corresponds to how the motif's shape gets translated, and that the red marks correspond with its shape and adjacency.  I'm trying to figure out which locations get Red (9) in the output. The positions are crucial. I'm comparing input 3x3 regions to output.\n\nI'm now looking at the second and third examples. I need to see if the mapping is consistent or if different rules are in play. I'm comparing the background patterns (black vs. orange) and seeing if that correlates with anything in the input. Is the \"black lattice\" always used?\n\nI'm noticing that the type of background\u2014black or orange lines\u2014seems to vary between the examples. Maybe it depends on the motif's shape? Perhaps, I should break down the examples by features\u2014 full horizontal or vertical rows/columns? I'm developing a theory: the full lines in the output depend on the complete lines in the motif. \n\nIt looks like the background depends on whether the motif has a full vertical or horizontal row. If it does, then the lattice is orange. Otherwise, it is black.\nI am calling the rules 'A' and 'B'. Now, I'm comparing all three output patterns to identify commonalities and differences.\n\nNext, I'm focusing on the overlay. The red elements (the overlay) always seem to form a shape, which looks to be related to the original motif's form. It has an overlay of red \"lines.\"\n\nI'm testing my theory by looking at the specific placement of the red elements and trying to draw a map to build the output. I'm trying to translate the 3x3 motif into the output. What if I can map them column-by-column? What happens with the \"neighboring\" pixels? I have to look more carefully at neighbor pixels and how they correspond to the output, where the red lines occur. I need to compare those features with the columns and rows of the input motif and the structure of the red lines.\n\nI'm also paying attention to the center pixel and trying to see if that influences anything in the output, maybe by having an 'anchor effect.'\n\nIt is now time to go back and check the hint \"The motif keeps its shape/relative layout but its color is normalized to red.\" If this is true, I must identify the elements of the output that correspond to the elements of the original.\n\nSo, for the test input, I can construct:\n\n1.  Background: Since the test input does not have complete lines, it uses 'Style B' (Orange lattice, black tiles).\n2.  Red Elements: V-lines red are triggered by side columns not being full. Pixel Overlay gets created.\n3.  Combine to create the output.\n\nThe ARC task involves transforming a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid. The transformation is based on interpreting the input \"motif\" (non-orange colored pixels) and projecting it onto a new grid structure with specific styling rules.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1.  **Output Grid Structure**:\n    The output is a 16x16 grid representing a 5x5 array of 2x2 \"tiles\" separated by 1-pixel wide grid lines.\n    -   Grid line indices: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n    -   Tile row/col indices: (1,2), (4,5), (7,8), (10,11), (13,14).\n\n2.  **Background Pattern (Lattice)**:\n    The background styling depends on the structural properties of the motif (specifically, whether it has full 3-pixel lines across the rows or columns).\n    -   **Style A (Example 1)**: If the motif has both full horizontal and vertical lines (e.g., a '+'), the background is \"Black Grid, Orange Tiles\".\n    -   **Style B (Example 2, 3)**: If the motif lacks full lines in one or both directions, the background is a \"Checkerboard\".\n        -   **Checkerboard Rule**:\n            -   **Line Rows (0, 3, 6...)**: Pixels at intersections are 0 (Black). Segments between intersections are 7 (Orange) if no full horizontal line exists in the motif.\n            -   **Tile Rows (1, 2, 4...)**: Segments on grid lines are 7 (Orange). Pixels inside tiles are 0 (Black).\n    -   **Application to Test Input**: The test motif is \"Four Corners\" (pixels at 0,0; 0,2; 2,0; 2,2 in the 3x3 bound). It has no full horizontal or vertical lines. Thus, it uses **Style B** (Checkerboard with Black Tiles).\n\n3.  **Motif Overlay (Red/9)**:\n    The motif shape is normalized to Red (9) and projected onto the central region of the output grid.\n    -   **Grid Lines (Rows/Cols 6, 9)**:\n        -   **Horizontal Lines**: Become Red if the motif has a full center row. The test motif does not.\n        -   **Vertical Lines**: Become Red if the motif's side columns are *not* full (as seen in Ex 1 and Ex 3). The test motif's side columns are not full (they are `2.2`, not `222`). So, **Cols 6 and 9 in Rows 6 and 9 become Red**.\n    -   **Pixels (Inside Tiles)**:\n        -   The presence of pixels in the output tiles mirrors the columns of the motif.\n        -   **Side Columns**: The test motif has pixels in the left and right columns. This maps to the inner edges of the side tiles (Cols 5 and 10). These become Red in the active rows (5, 7, 8, 10).\n        -   **Center Column**: The test motif has an empty center column. Thus, the center tile pixels (Cols 7, 8) remain Black (0).\n\n### Step-by-Step Construction\n-   **Background**: Construct the 16x16 Checkerboard.\n    -   Even Rows (0, 3, ...): `0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7...`\n    -   Odd Rows (1, 2, ...): `7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0...`\n-   **Overlay**:\n    -   **Rows 5, 10**: Apply Red to Cols 5 and 10. `...7, 9, 7, 0, 0, 7, 9, ...`\n    -   **Rows 6, 9**: Apply Red to Cols 6 and 9. `...7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7...`\n    -   **Rows 7, 8**: Apply Red to Cols 5 and 10. (Center cols 7,8 remain 0). `...7, 0, 9, 7, 0, 0, 7, 9, 0, 7...`\n\n### Completed Output Grid\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,0,0,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,0,0,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,0,0,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,0,0,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

Every cell that is **not 7** belongs to a single \u201cmotif\u201d.  \nFor the test input, the non\u20117 cells are four **2\u2019s**, so that\u2019s the motif.\n\nThe motif\u2019s **minimal bounding box** is always treated as a **3\u00d73 template** (it is 3\u00d73 in all given cases, including this test).\n\nTest motif 3\u00d73 template (rows 1\u20133, cols 3\u20135 of the input):\n```\n2 7 2\n7 7 7\n2 7 2\n```\nSo:\n- corners = motif\n- edge midpoints = background\n- center = background\n\n### 2) Build the 16\u00d716 lattice\nAll outputs are a **16\u00d716 grid** made from a repeating **3-cell period**:\n- rows/cols where index % 3 == 0 (0-based) are the **lattice lines**\n- the 2\u00d72 blocks between them are **tile interiors**\n\nSo each output cell is one of 4 types:\n- **intersection** (on both a lattice row and lattice col)\n- **horizontal segment** (on lattice row only)\n- **vertical segment** (on lattice col only)\n- **tile interior** (on neither)\n\n### 3) Use the 3\u00d73 template to decide which lattice parts are orange vs black\nThe 3\u00d73 template controls the lattice coloring by grouping its positions:\n- template **corners** \u2192 decide the color of **tile interiors**\n- template **top+bottom midpoints** \u2192 decide **vertical segments**\n- template **left+right midpoints** \u2192 decide **horizontal segments**\n- intersections are kept black (0) in the base\n\nRule:  \nIf the corresponding template positions are **background (7)**, that lattice part is **orange (7)**;  \nif they are **motif (non\u20117)**, that lattice part is **black (0)**.\n\nFor the test template:\n- corners are motif \u21d2 **tile interiors = 0**\n- all edge midpoints are background \u21d2 **horizontal segments = 7**, **vertical segments = 7**\n- intersections = 0\n\nThis produces the same black/orange \u201cXOR-like\u201d lattice as in Example 3.\n\n### 4) Place the motif in the center (color-normalized to red = 9)\nThe motif is position-normalized: it appears in the **central 6\u00d76 area** of the 16\u00d716 grid (rows 6\u201311 and cols 6\u201311 in 1-based indexing).\n\nInside that central area, any lattice part that corresponds to a **motif position** in the 3\u00d73 template is recolored from **black (0)** to **red (9)**, while orange parts stay orange.\n\nFor the test template:\n- corners are motif \u21d2 in the central area, **tile-interior cells become 9**\n- edge midpoints are background \u21d2 line segments stay 7\n- center is background \u21d2 intersections stay 0 (this is the key difference vs Example 3)\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation from the examples:\n\n## Analysis\n\n1. **Background Pattern Creation**: The non-orange (non-7) pattern in the input determines a 3\u00d73 background tile that tiles across the 16\u00d716 output. The tile is:\n   - Separator at position (0,0) is always 0 (black)\n   - Horizontal separator content (top row) depends on the motif's corner and edge positions\n   - Vertical separator content (left column) depends on the motif's corner and edge positions\n   - Content area (2\u00d72 bottom-right) is 7 if no corners have the motif color, otherwise 0\n\n2. **For the test input**: The motif is 2s at positions (0,2), (0,4), (2,2), (2,4), forming a 3\u00d73 pattern:\n   ```\n   X . X\n   . . .\n   X . X\n   ```\n\n3. **Background tile calculation**:\n   - Corners have X: content = 0\n   - Corners in left column both have X: V-sep = 7\n   - Corners in top row both have X AND no X in middle row edges: H-sep = 7\n   \n   This gives background tile:\n   ```\n   0 7 7\n   7 0 0\n   7 0 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Motif placement**: The motif is placed in the center (tiles 1-3), with 9s replacing 0s where the motif pattern indicates. Since the test motif has X only at corners with no connecting middle positions, only the corner tiles get 9s:\n   - Tile (1,1): rows 4-5, cols 4-5\n   - Tile (1,3): rows 4-5, cols 10-11\n   - Tile (3,1): rows 10-11, cols 4-5\n   - Tile (3,3): rows 10-11, cols 10-11\n\nWithin these tiles, background 0s become 9s.\n\n## Output\n\n```\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,9,9,7,0,0,7,9,9,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,9,9,7,0,0,7,9,9,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,9,9,7,0,0,7,9,9,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,9,9,7,0,0,7,9,9,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\n### Input \u2192 Output 1\n- **Input:** A square grid dominated by a **solid orange** background. There is one **green** connected component shaped like a **plus/cross** (orthogonal arms). It sits in the **lower-right area** of the orange field.\n- **Output:** A square grid with a **black** outer boundary and many **black** cells forming a regular lattice between colored cells. The non-black cells are mostly **orange**, appearing as separated \u201ctiles\u201d rather than a solid fill. A **red** plus/cross shape appears **near the center**.\n\n### Input \u2192 Output 2\n- **Input:** A square grid dominated by **orange**. There is one **blue** connected component shaped like a **capital \u201cH\u201d** (two vertical bars joined by a middle bar), placed roughly **centrally**.\n- **Output:** Again a **black-framed** grid with a strong presence of **black** cells separating **orange** tiles. A **red \u201cH\u201d** appears **near the center**.\n\n### Input \u2192 Output 3\n- **Input:** A square grid dominated by **orange**. There are **multiple magenta** components (several separated blocks) arranged around the center area (not a single connected blob).\n- **Output:** A **black** lattice/background with separated **orange** tiles. A **red** pattern appears near the **center**, corresponding to the magenta arrangement (appears as multiple red tiles rather than one solid blob).\n\n### Global changes / invariants observed\n- **New color introduced:** **black** appears in outputs (not visible in inputs).\n- **Color replacement:** the input \u201cforeground\u201d color varies (**green/blue/magenta**) but the output foreground is consistently **red**.\n- **Background behavior:** input background is a solid orange field; output background becomes **orange tiles separated by black**, plus a **black border/frame**.\n- **Position:** at least in example 1, the colored shape\u2019s **location differs** between input and output (output appears more centered).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement:** **present** (foreground location differs at least in pair 1)\n- **Object recoloring:** **present** (green/blue/magenta \u2192 red)\n- **Bordering / outlining:** **maybe** (black frame + internal black lattice could function as outlines)\n- **Filling holes or cavities:** **absent** (no clear hole-filling change is visible)\n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** **maybe** (only a clean motif is shown; could be extraction)\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** **present** (foreground motif appears re-placed onto a new background structure)\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center):** **maybe** (foreground ends up near center)\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** **maybe** (orange is dominant; non-orange treated as foreground)\n- **Size-based filtering or selection:** **absent/maybe** (no clear \u201clargest-only\u201d evidence; example 3 keeps multiple pieces)\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations:** **absent**\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** **maybe** (outputs look \u201cre-gridded\u201d/resampled; hard to confirm from drawing)\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** **absent/maybe** (shape identity is preserved, but displayed on a templated lattice)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **Foreground color is normalized:** regardless of whether the input shape is green, blue, or magenta, the output foreground becomes **red** (suggesting \u201cany non-background color \u2192 red\u201d).\n2. **Foreground geometry is preserved:** the *shape structure* (plus, H, separated blocks) is retained rather than replaced by a different symbol.\n3. **Absolute position is not preserved:** the foreground appears **re-centered/normalized** (most obvious in pair 1 where the input motif is off-center but output motif is central).\n4. **Background is converted into a lattice representation:** orange is no longer a solid fill; it becomes many **separated orange tiles** with systematic **black separators**, implying a rule-driven \u201cgridline insertion\u201d or \u201cpixel-as-tile on black\u201d rendering.\n5. **Multiple components are handled together:** in pair 3, several disconnected magenta pieces all undergo the same treatment and keep their relative arrangement, implying the transform applies to the **entire non-background pattern**, not just the largest blob.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nThe task likely identifies **orange as the background** (most frequent color) and treats **all other colors as the motif**. It then renders the scene onto a **black lattice** by converting background cells into **separated orange tiles** (with black \u201cgridlines\u201d/gaps between them) and recolors all motif cells to **red**, placing the motif in a **standardized/centered** position.  \nAmbiguity: the output canvas may correspond to either (a) the **full input** rendered with gridlines, or (b) a **cropped bounding box** around the motif rendered with gridlines (which would naturally remove the original offset).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks to perform when solving (validation ideas)\n\n1. **Determine background by frequency**: confirm orange is the most common in all inputs and maps to the orange tiles in output.\n2. **Bounding-box vs full-canvas test**: compute motif bounding box in input and see whether output dimensions match something like `2*w+1, 2*h+1` (cropped) or `2*W+1, 2*H+1` (full).\n3. **Gridline parity test**: check if black occupies every other row/column (or consistent separator positions), and colored tiles land on the complementary indices.\n4. **Color mapping check**: verify that *every* non-orange input pixel becomes red, and no original motif color survives.\n5. **Centering test**: compare motif centroid/bounding box in output to output center to see if explicit centering occurs.\n\n---\n\nHINT_START\n* Treat orange as the background; everything non-orange is \u201cthe motif.\u201d\n* The motif keeps its shape/relative layout but its color is normalized to red.\n* The output introduces a black lattice/frame, turning the orange background into separated orange tiles with black separators.\n* The motif\u2019s original placement is not kept; it appears position-normalized (often centered/cropped).\nHINT_END",

Small Glyphs: Monochromatic shapes (colors 1, 2, 3, 6) resembling letters or symbols (H, T, Cross) set against a solid background of color 7.\n2. Background Lattice: Large-scale repeating mesh or tiling patterns composed of color 0 lines/pixels and color 7 blocks.\n3. Central Highlight: A rectangular sub-region within the large grids where the structural elements (typically color 0) are replaced by color 9.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nCreate a 16\u00d716 grid with a 3-pixel-period lattice (line rows/cols at indices 0,3,6,9,12,15). Use the input\u2019s non-7 glyph (color/shape) only to choose a lattice variant that assigns 0/7 based on whether row/col are lattice lines (e.g., 3\u2192(rLine OR cLine)=0 else 7; 1\u21927 only on vertical lines excluding line-rows; 6\u21927 where rLine XOR cLine). Then apply a central 6\u00d76 highlight (rows 6\u201311, cols 6\u201311) converting all 0 in that region to 9 while leaving 7 unchanged. Input glyph colors 1/2/3/6 are not copied to output.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Comprehensive Analysis and Solution for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The user wants me to solve this ARC task, and it seems pretty straightforward once you break it down. I've got to create a 16x16 grid based on the provided examples and test input. The prompt hints strongly at the solution.\n\nFirst, I observe that all the inputs are 6x6 grids with a color 7 background (orange) and a distinct shape/glyph formed by a different color (1, 2, 3, or 6). I need to analyze how these glyphs dictate the structure of the 16x16 output grid. The outputs also have a repeating pattern with colors 0, 7, and 9. I also note the \"transformation description\" which is very useful.\n\n**Input Analysis and Lattice Structure:**\n\nI start by looking at the examples and identifying the core pattern. The inputs always have a single color that forms some sort of glyph against a constant background color. I deduce that the crucial element for the output is the presence of the lattice.\n\nAll the outputs are 16x16 grids. The critical element seems to be a lattice with a period of 3. This means horizontal and vertical lines at indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 (0-indexed). I will call these \"lattice lines\". These lines define a grid structure.\n\n**Color-Specific Lattice Rules:**\n\nI see that different input colors map to different lattice configurations:\n\n*   **Color 3 (Green) - Example 1:** \"Cells are 7\". The output grid looks like the lattice lines are black (0), and the cells are orange (7).\n*   **Color 1 (Blue) - Example 2:** \"Vertical lines 7\". Vertical lines are orange (7). Horizontal lines and cells are black (0).\n*   **Color 6 (Magenta) - Example 3:** \"All lines are 7\". Both vertical and horizontal lines are orange (7), so it makes an orange grid.\n\nI infer the crucial logic: each of the different colors will select parts of the lattice to be a different color.\n\n**Deduction for Test Input (Color 2, Red):**\n\nThe prompt doesn't explicitly define color 2. I need to figure out what pattern to apply. I look at the shape given in the test input. It consists of horizontal segments. I make the hypothesis that color 2 should be mapped to the horizontal lattice segments. I look for something orthogonal and complementary. Since Color 1 uses Vertical and Color 6 all lines, it logically follows that the Color 2 will be Horizontal lines.\n\n**Construction of the Output Grid:**\n\n1.  **Lattice definition:** I define the lattice structure based on indices divisible by 3 (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15).\n2.  **Color 2 Transformation:** I apply the rule: Horizontal lattice segments are orange (7), and the rest is black (0).\n3.  **Central Highlight:** I apply the final part: highlight. There is a central 6x6 area (indices 5-10 for both rows and columns) where the 0s become 9.\n\n**Generated Grid:**\n\nI build the grid now.\nThe output has 16 rows and 16 columns (indices from 0-15):\n\n*   The lattice rows are: rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15. The horizontal lattice parts are 7. The non-lattice columns are 0.\n*   The non-lattice rows are the rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14. All elements are 0, except for those in the range of the central 6x6 highlight (rows 5 to 10 and columns 5 to 10), which are converted from 0 to 9.\n\nSo based on this logic, I construct the result.\n```\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0\n\nTo solve this problem, I will break down the transformation rules by analyzing the solved examples and applying the logic to the test input.\n\n### 1. Grid Structure and Lattice Definition\nThe output is always a 16x16 grid. The description and examples point to a lattice structure with a period of 3.\n- **Lattice Lines**: Rows and Columns at indices $0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15$.\n- **Lattice Intersections**: Points where both row and column indices are lattice lines (e.g., $(0,0), (3,6)$). These appear to always be color 0 (black).\n- **Lattice Segments**: Parts of a lattice line between intersections.\n  - **Horizontal Segments**: Row is a lattice line, Column is not.\n  - **Vertical Segments**: Column is a lattice line, Row is not.\n- **Cells**: Regions where neither row nor column are lattice lines (the 2x2 areas inside the mesh).\n\n### 2. Logic for Coloring the Lattice\nThe input glyph color determines which parts of the lattice pattern are colored 7 (orange). The rest is 0 (black).\n- **Example 1 (Color 3, Shape '+')**: The logic provided implies that lattice lines are 0 and cells are 7. This is an \"inverse\" lattice or simply filling the cells.\n- **Example 2 (Color 1, Shape 'H')**: Vertical lattice segments are colored 7. Everything else (Horizontal segments, Cells, Intersections) is 0. This matches the vertical nature of the 'H'.\n- **Example 3 (Color 6, Shape 'Diamond/X')**: Both Vertical and Horizontal lattice segments are colored 7. Cells and Intersections are 0. This matches the connected grid shape.\n\n**Inference for Test Input (Color 2)**:\nThe test input contains color 2. The shape appears to be two horizontal pairs of dots.\nGiven the set of transformations:\n- Vertical Segments = 7 (Color 1)\n- Vertical & Horizontal Segments = 7 (Color 6)\n- The missing logical component is **Horizontal Segments = 7**.\nTherefore, for Color 2, we apply the rule: **Horizontal lattice segments are 7, everything else is 0.**\n\n### 3. Central Highlight\nA specific region of the grid is highlighted by changing color 0 to color 9 (maroon). Color 7 is unaffected.\n- **Region**: \"Rows 6\u201311, cols 6\u201311\" in 1-based numbering corresponds to **indices 5\u201310** (0-based) inclusive. This creates a centered 6x6 area.\n\n### 4. Constructing the Output for Test Input (Color 2)\n\n**Step A: Generate Base Pattern (Horizontal Segments = 7)**\n- **Lattice Rows** (Indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15):\n  - Intersection columns (0, 3, 6...) are 0.\n  - Segment columns (1, 2, 4, 5...) are 7.\n  - Pattern: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n- **Non-Lattice Rows** (Indices 1, 2, 4, 5...):\n  - These contain no horizontal lattice segments.\n  - Pattern: All `0`s.\n\n**Step B: Apply Highlight (Indices 5\u201310)**\nWe modify the base pattern for rows 5 through 10, specifically at columns 5 through 10.\n- **Rows 5, 7, 8, 10** (Non-Lattice Rows):\n  - Base: All 0.\n  - Highlight: Zeros in columns 5\u201310 become 9.\n  - Result segment (cols 5-10): `9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9`.\n  - Full Row: `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`\n- **Rows 6, 9** (Lattice Rows):\n  - Base: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n  - Columns 5\u201310 values: `7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7`.\n  - Apply Highlight (0->9, 7->7): `7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7`.\n  - Full Row: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n\n**Step C: Compile Final Grid**\n- Rows 0, 3, 12, 15: Base Lattice Row.\n- Rows 1, 2, 4, 11, 13, 14: Base Non-Lattice Row (All 0).\n- Rows 5, 7, 8, 10: Highlighted Non-Lattice Row.\n- Rows 6, 9: Highlighted Lattice Row.\n\noutput:\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

Small Glyphs: Monochromatic shapes (colors 1, 2, 3, 6) resembling letters or symbols (H, T, Cross) set against a solid background of color 7.\n2. Background Lattice: Large-scale repeating mesh or tiling patterns composed of color 0 lines/pixels and color 7 blocks.\n3. Central Highlight: A rectangular sub-region within the large grids where the structural elements (typically color 0) are replaced by color 9.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nCreate a 16\u00d716 grid with a 3-pixel-period lattice (line rows/cols at indices 0,3,6,9,12,15). Use the input\u2019s non-7 glyph (color/shape) only to choose a lattice variant that assigns 0/7 based on whether row/col are lattice lines (e.g., 3\u2192(rLine OR cLine)=0 else 7; 1\u21927 only on vertical lines excluding line-rows; 6\u21927 where rLine XOR cLine). Then apply a central 6\u00d76 highlight (rows 6\u201311, cols 6\u201311) converting all 0 in that region to 9 while leaving 7 unchanged. Input glyph colors 1/2/3/6 are not copied to output.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, here's my thought process on this ARC task.**\n\nThe user wants me to solve an ARC task, and I need to figure out the pattern in three provided examples to determine how to apply the pattern to the test input. I'm an expert in this field so I have a lot of tools at my disposal.\n\nI start by breaking down each example. I focus on the relationship between the input grid (shape and its color) and the output 16x16 grid, paying close attention to any color changes or patterns.\n\n**Example 1**:\nI see a cross shape in the input, colored green (color 3). I notice that the output grid has a lattice-like pattern where specific cells are colored differently, and there's a 6x6 highlight in the center.\n\n- I meticulously examine coordinates to try and understand the lattice structure.  I determine that the cell value is 0 if either the row or column index is divisible by 3 and 7 otherwise (unless in the highlight region). The pattern seems to use a 0, 7 structure. The hint emphasizes the highlight region, showing it's cells should be converted to 9.\n\n**Example 2**:\nHere, the input has an \"H\" shape in blue (color 1). The output is again a 16x16 grid with a similar lattice structure and highlight.\n\n-  I study the pattern and deduce that it's different this time. I find that cells where the row index is NOT divisible by 3, and the column index IS divisible by 3, the value is 7. Otherwise is 0.\n- So, the pattern is: 0 if row divisible by 3, or if the column index is not divisible by 3, is 0. I notice vertical struts.\n\n**Example 3**:\nThis time, it is colored magenta (color 6). The shape is an 'X' (or a checkerboard).\n\n- I carefully analyze the output pattern. I determine that if either the row OR the column is a multiple of 3. the output is 0, except where both rows and columns are multiples of 3. Otherwise the value is 7.\n- I read the description closely to gain more info. I read the hint: \"6->7 where rLine XOR cLine\" in the prompt. This confirmed my understanding.\n\nI think about the connection between the shape color and the lattice structure. I see a pattern:\n\n- **Green (3)** maps to a standard lattice (0 at intersections, 7 elsewhere).\n- **Blue (1)** maps to a vertical-dominated lattice (7 only on vertical lines).\n- **Magenta (6)** maps to a lattice where horizontal and vertical lines are 7, excluding intersections/holes.\n\n**Test Input**:\nThe shape is red (color 2), and it looks like a collection of 4 dots in a box. I have to find the pattern for color 2. I have rules now for 1, 3, 6, and I can start to make a hypothesis based on prior knowledge.\n\nMy current theory: There must be a relationship based on vertical and horizontal lines. Since Blue is Vertical, I hypothesize that RED will be horizontal. This means that cells at multiples of 3 in the row must output a 7 when the column is not a multiple of 3. Otherwise, 0. I apply this. I create the base, the pattern for the grid that excludes the highlight region. The rule is for Color 2: $7$ if the row is divisible by 3, and the column is not divisible by 3. Otherwise, is 0.\n\nNow that I have the base pattern defined, I apply the highlight to the grid (rows 5-10, cols 5-10). Any 0 in this range becomes a 9.\n\nFinally, I write out the complete output grid in the specified format, ready to solve the user's request.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples and the provided description, here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Input Glyph and Color**:\n    The test input contains a shape made of color 2 (Red) against a background of 7. The shape consists of pixels at (0,2), (0,4), (2,2), (2,4), suggesting a horizontal alignment or relationship.\n\n2.  **Infer the Lattice Logic**:\n    The problem maps the glyph color to a specific logic for generating a 16x16 background lattice (lines at indices divisible by 3).\n    *   **Color 3 (Green)**: Sets the lattice lines (rows/cols divisible by 3) to 0, holes to 7. (Logic: 0 if RowLine OR ColLine).\n    *   **Color 1 (Blue)**: Sets vertical line segments to 7, everything else to 0. (Logic: 7 if ColLine AND NOT RowLine).\n    *   **Color 6 (Magenta)**: Sets both vertical and horizontal line segments to 7, intersections and holes to 0. (Logic: 7 if RowLine XOR ColLine).\n    *   **Color 2 (Red)**: By observing the pattern (1 is Vertical, 6 is Both, 3 is Inverted Both), Color 2 corresponds to **Horizontal line segments**. The logic is: assign 7 only on horizontal lattice lines excluding the intersections (where columns are also lattice lines), and 0 elsewhere.\n    \n    **Pattern for Color 2**:\n    *   **On Lattice Rows (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15)**: If the column is NOT a lattice column (indices 1, 2, 4, 5, etc.), the cell is 7. At lattice columns (0, 3, 6...), the cell is 0 (intersection).\n        *   Row Pattern: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n    *   **On Non-Lattice Rows**: All cells are 0.\n\n3.  **Apply Central Highlight**:\n    A 6x6 region defined by rows 5\u201310 and columns 5\u201310 overlay the base pattern. In this region, any 0 is converted to 9, while 7s remain 7.\n\n    *   **Row 5 (Non-Lattice)**: Base is all 0. Highlight region (cols 5-10) becomes 9.\n        *   Result: `0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0`\n    *   **Row 6 (Lattice)**: Base is `0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0...`.\n        *   Cols 5-10: `7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7`.\n        *   Highlight applies to 0s: `7` stays `7`, `0` becomes `9`.\n        *   Result segment: `7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7`.\n        *   Full Row: `0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n    *   **Rows 7, 8, 10 (Non-Lattice)**: Same as Row 5.\n    *   **Row 9 (Lattice)**: Same as Row 6.\n\n4.  **Construct Final Grid**:\n    Combine the calculated rows to form the 16x16 output.\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

Small Glyphs: Monochromatic shapes (colors 1, 2, 3, 6) resembling letters or symbols (H, T, Cross) set against a solid background of color 7.\n2. Background Lattice: Large-scale repeating mesh or tiling patterns composed of color 0 lines/pixels and color 7 blocks.\n3. Central Highlight: A rectangular sub-region within the large grids where the structural elements (typically color 0) are replaced by color 9.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nCreate a 16\u00d716 grid with a 3-pixel-period lattice (line rows/cols at indices 0,3,6,9,12,15). Use the input\u2019s non-7 glyph (color/shape) only to choose a lattice variant that assigns 0/7 based on whether row/col are lattice lines (e.g., 3\u2192(rLine OR cLine)=0 else 7; 1\u21927 only on vertical lines excluding line-rows; 6\u21927 where rLine XOR cLine). Then apply a central 6\u00d76 highlight (rows 6\u201311, cols 6\u201311) converting all 0 in that region to 9 while leaving 7 unchanged. Input glyph colors 1/2/3/6 are not copied to output.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Background Lattice: Large-scale repeating mesh or tiling patterns composed of color 0 lines/pixels and color 7 blocks.\n3. Central Highlight: A rectangular sub-region within the large grids where the structural elements (typically color 0) are replaced by color 9.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nCreate a 16\u00d716 grid with a 3-pixel-period lattice (line rows/cols at indices 0,3,6,9,12,15). Use the input\u2019s non-7 glyph (color/shape) only to choose a lattice variant that assigns 0/7 based on whether row/col are lattice lines (e.g., 3\u2192(rLine OR cLine)=0 else 7; 1\u21927 only on vertical lines excluding line-rows; 6\u21927 where rLine XOR cLine). Then apply a central 6\u00d76 highlight (rows 6\u201311, cols 6\u201311) converting all 0 in that region to 9 while leaving 7 unchanged. Input glyph colors 1/2/3/6 are not copied to output.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Small Glyphs: Monochromatic shapes (colors 1, 2, 3, 6) resembling letters or symbols (H, T, Cross) set against a solid background of color 7.\n2. Background Lattice: Large-scale repeating mesh or tiling patterns composed of color 0 lines/pixels and color 7 blocks.\n3. Central Highlight: A rectangular sub-region within the large grids where the structural elements (typically color 0) are replaced by color 9.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nCreate a 16\u00d716 grid with a 3-pixel-period lattice (line rows/cols at indices 0,3,6,9,12,15). Use the input\u2019s non-7 glyph (color/shape) only to choose a lattice variant that assigns 0/7 based on whether row/col are lattice lines (e.g., 3\u2192(rLine OR cLine)=0 else 7; 1\u21927 only on vertical lines excluding line-rows; 6\u21927 where rLine XOR cLine). Then apply a central 6\u00d76 highlight (rows 6\u201311, cols 6\u201311) converting all 0 in that region to 9 while leaving 7 unchanged. Input glyph colors 1/2/3/6 are not copied to output.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The input is always a 6\u00d76 field of background color **7** with a small \u201cglyph\u201d drawn in another color. That glyph is **not copied** to the output; it only selects which **predefined 16\u00d716 lattice template** to generate.\n\n### 1) Build the 16\u00d716 3-period lattice coordinates\nIn all examples the output is a 16\u00d716 grid whose structure is based on rows/cols that are multiples of 3:\n\n- `rLine = (row index % 3 == 0)`  \u2192 rows **0,3,6,9,12,15**\n- `cLine = (col index % 3 == 0)`  \u2192 cols **0,3,6,9,12,15**\n\n### 2) Choose the lattice variant from the glyph color\nFrom the solved examples:\n- color **3** \u2192 only \u201cinterior blocks\u201d are 7, everything on lattice lines is 0  \n- color **1** \u2192 only vertical line-columns (excluding line-rows) are 7  \n- color **6** \u2192 both vertical and horizontal line cells (excluding intersections) are 7  \n\nThe missing case (glyph color **2**, used in the test) is the remaining symmetric option:\n- **color 2 \u2192 only horizontal line-rows (excluding line-columns) are 7**\n  - i.e. output **7** iff `rLine == True` and `cLine == False`, else **0**\n\n### 3) Apply the central highlight\nIn every example, the central **6\u00d76** region (perfectly centered) converts **0 \u2192 9** while leaving 7 unchanged.\nFor a 16\u00d716 grid, that region is:\n- rows **5\u201310**\n- cols **5\u201310**\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

Small Glyphs: Monochromatic shapes (colors 1, 2, 3, 6) resembling letters or symbols (H, T, Cross) set against a solid background of color 7.\n2. Background Lattice: Large-scale repeating mesh or tiling patterns composed of color 0 lines/pixels and color 7 blocks.\n3. Central Highlight: A rectangular sub-region within the large grids where the structural elements (typically color 0) are replaced by color 9.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nCreate a 16\u00d716 grid with a 3-pixel-period lattice (line rows/cols at indices 0,3,6,9,12,15). Use the input\u2019s non-7 glyph (color/shape) only to choose a lattice variant that assigns 0/7 based on whether row/col are lattice lines (e.g., 3\u2192(rLine OR cLine)=0 else 7; 1\u21927 only on vertical lines excluding line-rows; 6\u21927 where rLine XOR cLine). Then apply a central 6\u00d76 highlight (rows 6\u201311, cols 6\u201311) converting all 0 in that region to 9 while leaving 7 unchanged. Input glyph colors 1/2/3/6 are not copied to output.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

The glyph itself is *not copied* to the output; it only selects a lattice \u201cmode\u201d.\n\n2. **Create a 16\u00d716 lattice** with \u201cline\u201d indices every 3 cells:\n   - `rLine` if row index `r \u2208 {0,3,6,9,12,15}` (i.e., `r % 3 == 0`)\n   - `cLine` if col index `c \u2208 {0,3,6,9,12,15}` (i.e., `c % 3 == 0`)\n\n3. **Mode for glyph color 2** (the missing mode relative to the examples) is the horizontal counterpart of the vertical-lines mode:\n   - Set cell to **7 only on horizontal line-rows excluding line-columns**  \n     (i.e., `7` when `rLine` is true and `cLine` is false)\n   - Otherwise set cell to **0**.\n\n4. **Central highlight:** in the centered **6\u00d76** region (rows **5\u201310**, cols **5\u201310**), convert **every 0 to 9**, leaving 7 unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

                "response": "**Alright, let's break down these grids. Here's what I'm seeing:**\n\nMy first impression is that we've got two main groups: smaller 6x6 grids and larger 16x16 grids.  The smaller ones are straightforward: they've got a color 7 background, and then these little shapes or \"glyphs\" on top, which are in colors 1, 2, 3, or 6.  These shapes aren't random; they're pretty recognizable \u2013 like an 'H', a cross, a sideways 'T', and even just a few distinct dots. I see these as distinct visual objects on the background.\n\nNow, the larger grids are more complex.  They start with a background pattern made up of colors 0 and 7.  It's a repeating pattern \u2013 almost like a lattice or a tiling. I'm seeing lines or a mesh of color 0 with the cells filled in by color 7. It can also appear as a checkerboard alternating the colors.\n\nThe real interesting bit is that there's usually a specific, central region that's \"highlighted\" with color 9.  This isn't just a solid block of color 9, though.  It changes the underlying pattern or \"background\" structure by replacing color 0 elements or dots with color 9 while maintaining the overall shape.\n\nSo, to summarize it very concisely, we have:\n\n*   **Small Grids:** Color 7 Background, Colored Glyphs (1, 2, 3, 6)\n*   **Large Grids:** Repeating Pattern of 0 and 7, Central Color 9 \"Patch\"\n\n\nBased on the visual data provided in the grids, the objects can be categorized into two distinct groups based on the grid size and composition.\n\n**1. Objects in Small Grids (6x6):**\n*   **Background:** These grids feature a uniform background consisting entirely of color 7.\n*   **Glyphs/Symbols:** Within the background, there are small, monochromatic shapes formed by distinct colors.\n    *   **Color 2 Object:** A dispersed set of pixels or points arranged symmetrically.\n    *   **Color 6 Object:** A geometric shape resembling a cross or a plus sign.\n    *   **Color 1 Object:** A geometric shape resembling the letter 'H'.\n    *   **Color 3 Object:** A geometric shape resembling a 'T' rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Attributes:** These objects typically span a 3x3 area and are centered or slightly offset within the grid.\n\n**2. Objects in Large Grids (16x16):**\n*   **Lattice/Mesh Background:** These grids are dominated by a repetitive, structural pattern covering the entire canvas.\n    *   **Composition:** The pattern is composed of color 0 and color 7.\n    *   **Structure:** This often takes the form of a grid or mesh where lines of color 0 enclose 2x2 blocks of color 7, or a repeating tiling pattern of color 0 and color 7 segments.\n*   **Central Region:** There is a distinct rectangular zone located in the center of the grid.\n    *   **Composition:** This area is defined by the introduction of color 9.\n    *   **Integration:** The color 9 pixels do not form a solid block; instead, they replace specific elements of the existing Lattice/Mesh structure. For example, color 0 grid lines become color 9 lines, or specific color 0 pixels within the pattern switch to color 9, while the color 7 components often remain or are bordered by the new color.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Small Glyphs: Monochromatic shapes (colors 1, 2, 3, 6) resembling letters or symbols (H, T, Cross) set against a solid background of color 7.\n2. Background Lattice: Large-scale repeating mesh or tiling patterns composed of color 0 lines/pixels and color 7 blocks.\n3. Central Highlight: A rectangular sub-region within the large grids where the structural elements (typically color 0) are replaced by color 9.\n</objects_summary>",
