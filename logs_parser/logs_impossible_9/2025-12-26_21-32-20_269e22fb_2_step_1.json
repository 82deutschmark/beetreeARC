        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Solution for the ARC AGI Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with solving this ARC AGI problem using Python. The goal is to take an input grid and produce a 20x20 output grid based on some pattern. I'm going to break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the input and the output. I analyze several examples. The output grid size is always 20x20. Interesting. The input size varies, which suggests it's a sample. Sometimes the input appears to be the top-left portion of the output, but not always. The output grids often have diagonal or repeating structures, like tiling. So, the input might be a \"window\" into a larger pattern, which is then extended or \"filled\" to make the 20x20 output.\n\nI'm thinking, is it a simple tiling or shifting problem? I check for repeats, but the input is not just copied into the output. What if it is a translation or even more complex geometric shifting? The 20x20 output is key: the input might define a smaller repeating pattern. The input *must* encode the pattern.\n\nIt seems to me that for some examples, the input grid is just the top-left portion of the output. Ex 2, and 4 are not at (0,0), but the others are, based on my understanding, or so I believe. Now, the mismatch between input and output *might* be something I'm missing! The solution must be there, and this inconsistency is key. It implies that the input is a subset or crop of the output. If the input is not (0,0) in the output, my initial strategy breaks.\n\nTherefore, the input might define a texture or pattern; this implies a texture synthesis problem. It's essentially the task of \"extrapolating the pattern\". In particular, it's about \"reproducing\" local patterns. I can fill the grid using a patch-based approach. The pattern is usually described by local constraints (e.g. adjacent pixels).\nSo, if I find local overlaps, I can recreate larger patterns. The goal is to extend from the seed. The trick is: find the key to build the whole grid.\n\nSo, I will build an iterative solver:\n1.  Initialize a 20x20 output grid.\n2.  Copy input at the top-left corner.\n3.  Fill empty cells by analyzing its neighbors (Left, Top, Top-Left, Top-Right) and finding similar contexts in the input to select a valid candidate value. If the neighborhood from the target output pixel has already been filled, I look at the input to find other places where such a neighbor is seen.\n4.  If multiple choices, I take the \"best one\". This approach handles the edge case.\nThe code should be efficient and robust.\n\nI hope this helps!\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the training examples, the task involves extending a periodic pattern defined by the input grid to a fixed size of 20x20. The input grid acts as a sample (or crop) of a larger underlying 2D texture. In most examples, the input grid aligns with the top-left corner (0,0) of the output grid. The solution involves copying the input to the output canvas and then filling the remaining pixels by synthesizing the texture. The synthesis is performed by finding the best matching patch in the original input for each new pixel's neighborhood (context).\n\nHere is the Python solver function:\n\n```python\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    input_h = len(input_grid)\n    input_w = len(input_grid[0])\n    output_h, output_w = 20, 20\n    \n    # Initialize output grid with -1 to indicate unfilled pixels\n    output_grid = [[-1 for _ in range(output_w)] for _ in range(output_h)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid to the top-left of the output grid\n    for r in range(min(input_h, output_h)):\n        for c in range(min(input_w, output_w)):\n            output_grid[r][c] = input_grid[r][c]\n            \n    # Neighbors to check for context matching: Left, Top-Left, Top, Top-Right\n    # These are the pixels already filled during a scanline traversal\n    offsets = [(0, -1), (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1)]\n    \n    # Iterate through the output grid in scanline order (row by row, then col by col)\n    for r in range(output_h):\n        for c in range(output_w):\n            # Skip if already filled (from the initial copy step)\n            if output_grid[r][c] != -1:\n                continue\n            \n            best_val = 0\n            max_score = -1\n            \n            # Iterate through all pixels in the input grid to find the best source\n            for ir in range(input_h):\n                for ic in range(input_w):\n                    score = 0\n                    possible = True\n                    \n                    # Check context consistency\n                    for dr, dc in offsets:\n                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc       # Output neighbor\n                        inr, inc = ir + dr, ic + dc   # Input neighbor\n                        \n                        # Only consider valid, already-filled neighbors in the output\n                        if 0 <= nr < output_h and 0 <= nc < output_w and output_grid[nr][nc] != -1:\n                            # If the corresponding neighbor in input is within bounds\n                            if 0 <= inr < input_h and 0 <= inc < input_w:\n                                if input_grid[inr][inc] == output_grid[nr][nc]:\n                                    score += 1\n                                else:\n                                    # Mismatch found, this input pixel is not a valid source\n                                    possible = False\n                                    break\n                            else:\n                                # Neighbor in input is out of bounds.\n                                # This context cannot be verified, so we don't count it towards the score.\n                                # But it's not a hard mismatch.\n                                pass\n                    \n                    if possible:\n                        # If the context matches (or is neutral), check if it's the best score so far\n                        if score > max_score:\n                            max_score = score\n                            best_val = input_grid[ir][ic]\n            \n            output_grid[r][c] = best_val\n            \n    return output_grid\n```",
