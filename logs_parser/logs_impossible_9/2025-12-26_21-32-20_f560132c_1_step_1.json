        "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, here's my understanding of the problem and the strategy I'll use. The task is to create a Python function, `solver(input)`, that can solve these ARC AGI tasks.\n\n**My Approach: Combining Shape Transformations and Z-Order**\n\nMy initial thought is that the solution involves extracting shapes from different parts of the input grid, rotating them, and then combining them to generate the output. Here's how I break it down:\n\n1.  **Input Decomposition:** The input grid seems to be divided into four quadrants: Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, and Bottom-Right. I need a way to extract and process these four parts separately.\n2.  **Key Identification:** The Top-Left quadrant contains a \"Key\" object. This \"Key\" is crucial. It holds the key to color mappings. The 2x2 grid *inside* the \"Key\" dictates which color corresponds to which other object in the input (Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n3.  **Shape Extraction:** I need to extract the \"shapes\" of the objects in the other three quadrants (Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). For this, I'll identify the bounding box of non-zero pixel regions, essentially trimming out empty space around the shapes.\n4.  **Rotation Transformations:** It seems that the shapes from the Top-Right, Bottom-Left, and Bottom-Right quadrants need to be rotated.\n    *   Top-Right: Rotated 90 degrees clockwise (CW).\n    *   Bottom-Left: Rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise (CCW).\n    *   Bottom-Right: Likely 90 CW (still testing with code implementation)\n5.  **Canvas Size:** The size of the output grid isn't always the same as the input, and also, it's not simply the bounding box of all shapes. I think the output's dimensions depend on a combination of the *width* of the Top-Left shape (Key) and the width of the *rotated* Top-Right shape. I call this \"S\".\n6.  **Color Mapping:** The Key dictates the color mapping. I extract the colors from the 2x2 inner region of the Key. The first color becomes the new color for whatever came from the Top-Left quadrant, the second one for Top-Right, etc.\n7.  **Z-Order Stacking:** Shapes are combined by using a Z-order. Specifically, it looks like they are stacked in this order: Bottom-Right, then Bottom-Left, then Top-Right, and finally Top-Left. This means shapes \"drawn\" later will cover earlier ones at overlapping spots.\n\n**Verification with Examples:**\nI have been using the examples to verify each step and tweak them. For Example 1, my approach means I need to extract all the pixels, trim to get a 5x5 key, 4x3 Orange, 8x7 Yellow, 5x3 Green, then:\n\n-   Colors: 2 = TL Color; 7=TR Color; 4=BL Color; 3=BR Color\n-   Output Size S = 5 + 3 = 8.\n-   TL: keep, BL: rotate CCW, TR: rotate CW, BR: 90 CW or CCW\n\n**Implementation:**\n\nI will create functions for all the steps:\n-   `extract_quadrant(grid, row_start, row_end, col_start, col_end)`\n-   `trim_zeros(subgrid)`\n-   `get_key_colors(tl_subgrid)`\n-   `apply_rotation(subgrid, k)` (k = -1 for CW, 1 for CCW)\n-   `place_object(output, object, row_start, col_start)`\n\nOverall, I'm confident in this approach. The main remaining area of potential improvement is related to fine-tuning the rotations, but I should be able to get a solution working with this logic.\n\n\nAn ARC AGI task solver in Python.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ARC task by extracting 4 shapes from the input quadrants,\n    applying rotations, determining the output size, and assembling them\n    with a specific color mapping derived from the top-left 'Key' object.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_np = np.array(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_np.shape\n    mid_row, mid_col = rows // 2, cols // 2\n\n    # Extract Quadrants (Raw)\n    # TL: Top-Left, TR: Top-Right, BL: Bottom-Left, BR: Bottom-Right\n    q_tl = input_np[0:mid_row, 0:mid_col]\n    q_tr = input_np[0:mid_row, mid_col:cols]\n    q_bl = input_np[mid_row:rows, 0:mid_col]\n    q_br = input_np[mid_row:rows, mid_col:cols]\n\n    def get_bbox(grid):\n        # Find bounding box of non-zero pixels\n        rows_idx, cols_idx = np.nonzero(grid)\n        if len(rows_idx) == 0:\n            return None\n        return grid[rows_idx.min():rows_idx.max()+1, cols_idx.min():cols_idx.max()+1]\n\n    # Extract Shapes (cropped to bounding box)\n    s_tl = get_bbox(q_tl)\n    s_tr = get_bbox(q_tr)\n    s_bl = get_bbox(q_bl)\n    s_br = get_bbox(q_br)\n    \n    # If any quadrant is empty, we handle it gracefully (though problem implies they exist)\n    if s_tl is None: return [] # Should not happen based on examples\n    \n    # --- Analyze Key (TL Shape) to get Color Map ---\n    # The key object contains a frame (most common color?) and 4 inner colors.\n    # Ex 1: Frame 2.
