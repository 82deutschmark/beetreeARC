            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, here's my plan for tackling this ARC task.**\n\nThe user's given me two examples and a test input, and I'm being asked to figure out the underlying logic. Based on the \"PROTOCOL OVERRIDE\" section, I'm expecting a tricky prompt designed to elicit detailed reasoning, but with conflicting output instructions: explain *and* only reveal the grid. I'll stick with the standard approach for these ARC tasks: provide a clear explanation and the final grid. I'll keep the explanation concise, but thorough, avoiding raw internal dumps, but still answering the user's request. It's safe to say the \"PROTOCOL OVERRIDE\" looks like an attempt at prompt engineering to boost performance.\n\nMy initial thought is to identify a general \"assembly\" rule. After analyzing the examples, it looks like this:\n\n1.  **Breaking Down the Shapes:** Each shape is made up of a color and some red pixels attached to it. The red pixels act like connectors. The goal is to put all these shapes together so the red pixels fit together or line up.\n2.  **The Matching Game:** Think of it like tiles with connectors. The red pixels match, meaning if a shape has red pixels at the bottom matching the right side of another, they go together in that way.\n\nNow for the test input:\n\n1.  **Get the Parts:** I'll map out all of the different shapes and write down where the red pixels are, how they fit together.\n2.  **Make the Connections:** I'll look for matching sets of red pixels.\n3.  **Put it Together:** I'll build a map showing how everything connects.\n\nI need to draw the final grid. I have found the pixel positions for each shape, and now I'll create the 26x26 grid according to the calculated positions of each shape, with the red pixels linking them together. I'll make sure the red pixels that touch or overlap stay visible, just like in the output of the example.\n\nAn object-oriented analysis of the examples reveals a consistent \"assembly\" logic. The puzzle behaves like a snap-together construction kit.\n\n### Transformation Logic:\n1.  **Component Identification**: The input grid contains several distinct \"parts\". Each part consists of a primary colored shape (the body) and one or more red (`2`) pixels adjacent to it.\n2.  **Connectors (Ports)**: The red (`2`) pixels function as connection points or \"ports\".\n    *   Each port has a specific configuration (position relative to the shape body).\n    *   Parts are designed to snap together such that their red ports overlap or align perfectly (e.g., a \"male\" port on one shape fits a \"female\" location on another, or two boundary ports merge).\n    *   A connection is valid if the red pixels from Shape A and Shape B occupy the same relative position in the assembled structure, effectively merging into a single red joint.\n3.  **Assembly Graph**:\n    *   By analyzing the spatial \"signatures\" of the red pixels on each shape in the test input, we can deduce the assembly order:\n        *   **Teal (8)** acts as a central hub. It has ports on the top, bottom, and right.\n        *   **Vertical Green (3)** has a bottom port that matches the **Teal** top port.\n        *   **Blue (1)** has a top-left port that matches the **Teal** bottom-right port. The Blue shape forms a container.\n        *   **Yellow (4)** fits into the opening of the Blue container. It connects to the right side of the Teal shape (Teal right port matches Yellow left port).\n        *   **Pink (6)** has top ports that match the **Blue** bottom ports.\n        *   **Horizontal Green (3)** connects to the right side of **Yellow**.\n        *   **Grey (5)** connects to the top of the **Horizontal Green** shape.\n4.  **Final Geometry**: The transformation involves moving all pieces from their scattered input positions to their final connected positions to form a single cohesive structure. The final grid preserves the shape colors and the red connecting pixels at the interfaces.\n\n### Step-by-Step Construction:\n1.  **Center**: Place the **Teal (8)** shape.\n2.  **Top**: Attach **Vertical Green (3)** to the top of Teal.\n3.  **Bottom/Base**: Attach **Blue (1)** below/right of Teal. Attach **Pink (6)** below Blue.\n4.  **Right Branch**: Attach **Yellow (4)** to the right of Teal (nesting inside the top of Blue). Attach **Horizontal Green (3)** to the right of Yellow. Attach **Grey (5)** to the top of Horizontal Green.\n\nThe output grid is generated by rendering these shapes in their calculated relative positions.\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,4,4,4,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,4,4,4,2,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, here's my understanding of the problem and the steps I'm taking to solve it, as I see them right now:**\n\n1.  **Goal**:  I need to figure out the rules for an ARC puzzle. The goal is to transform input grids into output grids. I'm focusing on analyzing how objects in the input are changed/moved/combined to form the output.\n\n2.  **Initial Exploration**: I'm starting by carefully looking at example input/output pairs.  I'm trying to identify the basic elements: different colored shapes, and most importantly, any special features like the red (2) pixels.  The red pixels seem to be a key element.\n\n3.  **Red Pixel Hypotheses**:  Initially, I thought the red pixels might indicate gravity, movement direction, or barriers. Now, I suspect that they act as connectors or \"ports\" for objects, defining how shapes will attach to each other.\n\n4.  **Assembly Logic**: My central idea is that the puzzles are about assembling shapes, almost like puzzle pieces. Each object has \"male\" (red pixels sticking out) and \"female\" (red pixels embedded or adjacent) connectors. Two objects connect if their red pixels align, overlap, or the \"pattern\" of red pixels matches.\n\n5.  **Refined Algorithm**:  My new plan is to:\n    *   Break the input into separate objects.\n    *   Find the \"red interface\" or the ports for each object.\n    *   Figure out the rules of connection (alignment, and which port matches which).\n    *   Find the configuration where all the ports connect.\n    *   Construct the complete shape.\n\n6.  **Example Analysis**: I'm testing my theory with the provided examples and the test input by:\n    *   Identifying all the objects, and their basic shapes.\n    *   Analyzing the relative positions of the red pixels.\n    *   Matching up the ports to understand how the components must connect.\n    *   Checking the constraints of ports and matching the ones that have compatible patterns.\n    *   Analyzing the relative shifts and positions of objects.\n    *   Building the whole structure.\n    *   Performing coordinate transformations on each shape.\n    *   Finally, reconstructing the output grid.\n\n7.  **Key Steps**: The process is highly iterative, involving:\n    *   Shape identification.\n    *   Connector identification.\n    *   Mapping and alignment.\n    *   Testing connections.\n    *   Applying the correct transformations to the parts.\n    *   Checking all the connections.\n    *   Checking boundary conditions.\n    *   Building the final output.\n\n8.  **Output Construction**: I'm using the transformation rules and the alignment logic to reconstruct the output grid row by row. This includes handling the red pixels (connectors) in the output, since they appear in the final grid.\n\n9.  **Verification**: After generating the output, I'm checking to make sure that the output corresponds with the logic of the transformation.\n\n\nThe solution involves decomposing the input grid into distinct \"objects\" defined by their colors and attached red (color 2) pixels. These red pixels act as \"connectors\" or \"ports\". The transformation requires assembling these objects into a single coherent structure by overlapping their compatible red connectors.\n\n**Analysis of Objects and Connectors:**\n\n1.  **Magenta (6) Object**: Base piece. Top connectors at relative columns 18 and 22 (distance 4).\n2.  **Blue (1) Object**: Sits on Magenta. Bottom connectors at relative columns 2 and 6 (distance 4), matching Magenta. Top connectors at relative columns 2 (left leg) and 4 (right leg).\n3.  **Yellow (4) Object**: Central hub. Bottom connector matches Blue's left top connector (2). Left connector (side) matches Teal. Right connector (side) matches Green Comb.\n4.  **Green Single (3) Object**: Sits on Blue's right leg. Bottom connector matches Blue's right top connector (4).\n5.  **Teal (8) Object**: Connects to the left side of Yellow. Its right-side connector matches Yellow's left connector.\n6.  **Green Comb (3) Object**: Connects to the right side of Yellow. Its left-side connector matches Yellow's right connector. Top connectors match Grey.\n7.  **Grey (5) Object**: Sits on Green Comb. Bottom connectors match Green Comb's top connectors.\n\n**Assembly Logic:**\n\n*   **Magenta** is placed at the bottom center (Cols 14-18, Rows 18-21).\n*   **Blue** stacks on Magenta (Cols 14-18, Rows 13-17).\n*   **Yellow** stacks on Blue's left leg (Cols 14-18, Rows 11-14).\n*   **Green Single** stacks on Blue's right leg (Col 18, Rows 10-13).\n*   **Teal** attaches to Yellow's left (Cols 10-14, Rows 9-14).\n*   **Green Comb** attaches to Yellow's right (Cols 18-25, Rows 12-16).\n*   **Grey** stacks on Green Comb (Cols 19-24, Rows 8-12).\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\nThe final grid is constructed by placing these objects in their calculated relative positions, ensuring all red connectors overlap perfectly. The background is black (0).\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,3,5,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,4,4,4,3,5,5,0,0,5,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,4,4,4,3,0,2,0,0,2,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,4,4,4,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

The shapes form chains that extend from the yellow block in different directions\n\nFor the test input:\n- Yellow block at rows 10-12, cols 10-12 with markers at (9,12), (10,9), (12,13), (13,11)\n- Shape 8 (azure frame) connects to yellow's top marker\n- Shape 3 small (vertical line) connects to yellow's left marker  \n- Shape 1 (L-shape) connects to yellow's bottom marker\n- Shape 6 (U-shape) connects below shape 1\n- Shape 3 large (E-shape) connects to shape 8's right side\n- Shape 5 (rectangle) connects above shape 3 large (partially visible at top)\n\nThe shapes chain together via their matching 2-markers: single markers connect to single markers, pairs of markers connect to matching pairs.\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode.

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Problem Decomposition & Solution Strategy**\n\nThe task involves understanding and solving ARC problems using two provided examples. My goal is to synthesize the input data, extract essential features and patterns from the two examples, and design a general solution applicable to new inputs.\n\n**Data Analysis & Feature Extraction**\n\nI begin by noting the key visual features: large grids filled with colored pixel objects, red pixels at the edges (serving as \"connectors\"), and the transformation from scattered objects in the input to a consolidated structure in the output. I analyze the grid representation of the objects. Standard ARC colors are assigned to numbers.\n\n**Example 1: In-depth Exploration**\n\nI then delve into Example 1. Here, I identify the objects by shape and color. I trace the pixels for each object to define shapes (like Blue \"C\", Azure \"n\", Green/Grey \"U\", and a Yellow 3x3 square). Red pixels are labeled and considered as connection points. The output, where these objects are connected to form a cohesive pattern, is visualized and data is parsed to infer how they connect.\n\nI identify a rule, likely related to geometric shape, that dictates the connections. I define connection ports (the positions of the red pixels) for each object. The goal is to figure out the connection mechanism.\n\nI trace the pixel positions in input data to determine the properties and location of each object and its ports. I begin by hypothesizing that connection is facilitated by \"matching\" red pixels or geometric alignment. I test the hypothesis by examining the example grids closely.\n\nThis is a deep dive. I use pixel indexing to map object parts to their respective input and output coordinate positions. I look at each part of an object to check the position of each of its ports. I check the output for red pixels to determine the location and connection mechanism. It is realized that red pixels are the joint between shapes.\n\nI infer that the red pixels at the edges of shapes \"snap\" objects together. It seems that the pattern of these \"ports\" (red pixels) is crucial. In the connection, red pixels of various objects merge into one red pixel (as implied by Example 1 and the output grid).\n\nI analyze the example output (the assembled shape). This is used to test my port pattern hypothesis. I determine that the shape has multiple ports on its left, right, and bottom edges that allow other objects to attach to them.\n\nI begin to generalize the procedure for the connection rule: identify each object by color, find its ports, and connect it to other objects based on matching ports and geometric patterns. I make the observation that Red pixels play a special role and may indicate the attachment type (plug or socket).\n\n**Example 2 & Refinement of Rules**\n\nExample 2 is examined similarly for additional hints. I deduce a rule of **unconnected ports disappearing** based on Example 1 where some red pixels are present in the inputs but absent in the output. Rotation is a potential transformation needed to achieve connection based on matching patterns, though this isn't clear for some of the objects from the first example.\n\nI test whether the output can be built just by following the \"connect the ports\" rules. I am looking for the main \"Hub\" shape in example two that will dictate the shape of the full output.\n\n**Test Input & Rule Validation**\n\nI then shift focus to the \"Test Input\". Here, the steps are:\n1.  Identify the objects (Azure, Pink, Yellow, Grey, and a combination of Blue+Green objects).\n2.  Determine port positions.\n3.  Design an assembly.\n\nBased on observations, I form an assembly based on two units. Unit 1 is the loop of Pink+Blue, and Unit 2 is the loop of Azure+Grey. These units have ports that can connect to Green. Yellow is a hub. These form two loops and a single green unit.\n\nI design the connections:\n1.  Pink+Blue forms a loop (Pink at the top, Blue at the bottom).\n2.  Azure+Grey forms a second loop (Azure on top, Grey at the bottom).\n3.  Green forms a connector for these two.\n4.  Yellow is the central base.\n\n**Output Grid Construction**\n\nI then plan to construct the output grid based on a few assumptions: that objects are placed adjacently, the outputs should be the same size, and the geometry is simple (the object will have an edge that will attach, not wrap around, the yellow 3x3) I place the Yellow in the center. I envision this as a \"Tower\" or \"Bot\" structure with connected loops. Finally, I will write the precise positions of each piece and construct the expected output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we need to assemble scattered objects into a single connected structure.\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation rules are:\n1.  **Identify Objects**: The input grid contains distinct colored objects. Each object has \"ports\" marked by Red pixels (value 2).\n2.  **Match Ports**: Objects connect to each other where their ports align. We look for matching patterns of red pixels (e.g., spacing between two red pixels, or a single red pixel connecting to a specific surface).\n3.  **Assemble**: We move (and possibly rotate) the objects to snap them together at the ports.\n    *   **Yellow (4)** acts as the central hub. It has ports on multiple sides.\n    *   Other objects form loops or attachments to the hub.\n    *   **Unit Formation**: Some objects connect to each other first to form \"Loops\" (e.g., two U-shapes facing each other). These units then attach to the main structure.\n4.  **Red Pixels**: The red pixels serve as connectors/joints and are preserved in the output at the connection points. Unused ports (if any) are removed.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n**Objects & Ports Analysis:**\n*   **Yellow (4)**: Center Hub (3x3 square). Ports: Top(12), Left(9), Right(13), Bottom(11).\n*   **Green (3)**: Right side. Shape is `]` (C-shape facing Left). Top edge has ports (12, 15). Left tips have ports (22, 24).\n*   **Azure (8)**: Top Left. Shape is `n` (inverted U). Legs have ports (spacing 2).\n*   **Grey (5)**: Middle Right. Shape is `U` (or box open at top). Ports at top (row 16) spacing 2.\n*   **Pink (6)**: Top Right. Shape is `U`. Ports at tips spacing 3.\n*   **Blue (1)**: Bottom Left. Shape is `U`. Ports at tips spacing 3.\n\n**Assembly Logic:**\n1.  **Loops**:\n    *   **Azure (8) + Grey (5)**: Azure `n` (spacing 2) connects to Grey `U` (spacing 2). This forms a rectangular loop.\n    *   **Pink (6) + Blue (1)**: Pink `U` (spacing 3) connects to Blue `U` (spacing 3). One must rotate (Pink becomes `n`). This forms a rectangular loop.\n2.  **Hub Connections**:\n    *   **Green (3)** connects to the **Right** of Yellow. Yellow's Right port (13) connects to Green's inner structure or tips. Given Green's shape `]`, if flipped to `[`, it cups the space to its left. However, Green's Top ports (spacing 2) perfectly match the **Azure/Grey Loop** width? No, the Azure/Grey loop is width 6. Green top ports are at 12 and 15 (spacing 3). Wait, 15-12 = 3.\n    *   Let's re-verify spacing.\n        *   Azure Legs: 3, 6 (Distance 3).\n        *   Grey Ports: 19, 22 (Distance 3).\n        *   Green Top Ports: 12, 15 (Distance 3).\n    *   So **Azure/Grey Loop** (Width 6) sits on top of **Green** (Width 7).\n    *   **Green** attaches to **Yellow**. Green (Right) matches Yellow (Right).\n    *   **Pink/Blue Loop** (Width 5). Does it attach to Yellow? Yellow Left Port matches. Blue (1) connects to Yellow Left.\n\n**Structure:**\n*   **Center**: Yellow (4).\n*   **Right**: Green (3) attached to Yellow.\n*   **Top of Green**: Azure (8) + Grey (5) Loop.\n*   **Left of Yellow**: Blue (1) + Pink (6) Loop.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   The grid size remains 26x22 (or input size).\n*   Yellow stays roughly central (e.g., Row 11-13).\n*   Construct the connected component around Yellow.\n\nOutput Grid:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,2,4,4,4,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,4,4,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,4,4,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Solution Design and Implementation for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got in mind: the goal is to figure out how to arrange shapes on a grid, like assembling a puzzle or building a molecular structure. There's a central \"hub\" (usually the square) and other \"spoke\" pieces that need to connect to it. The key is these red pixels, they are like connectors.\n\nThe core idea is to find matching connector patterns on the pieces. I\u2019ve started analyzing two examples to see how the connection logic works. The \"hub\" has ports or connectors, these are groups of red pixels in a certain pattern on a side of the hub. The \"spoke\" pieces also have these ports (in the form of red pixels) on their edges. Pieces connect where their connector patterns match or \"fit.\" Rotation might be needed to align connector patterns. Red pixels seem to be the connection points that align during assembly. Sometimes the number of pins on a connection port needs to be considered.\n\nLet\u2019s step by step look at one particular example. The yellow hub has three connectors: one on top (two pins), one on the right (single pin), and one on the bottom (single pin). The other pieces each have matching connector patterns. A \"light blue\" shape goes to the top, a \"blue\" shape goes to the right, and something else connects to the bottom. Each piece has red pins that go together. The red pins might also show the direction to assemble the shape.\n\nThe most challenging part comes from identifying the correct order for the pieces and sometimes understanding the transformation of the pieces. I suspect each piece can rotate (90, 180, 270 degrees). So, it\u2019s a matter of matching ports/connectors and aligning pieces so the correct pins meet. Pieces may also attach to the sides of other pieces. I'm going to create a library of connectors for each shape.\n\nFor one solution, it seems the order is: the hub, then light blue to the left, green below and blue to the right. Finally, the pink piece fits with the blue piece and the gray is also connected to the structure.\n\nTo generate the solution grid, I\u2019ll start with the hub, draw the pixels, add the connectors. Then I use a calculated offset to move each shape into place (based on how to match the pins). I'll need to keep track of pixel offsets and rotations. I need to make sure the parts don't bump into each other. I'll need to be precise when it comes to the coordinates of the pieces.\n\n\nThe task requires assembling a set of scattered \"puzzle pieces\" into a single coherent structure centered around a \"Hub\". The rules for assembly are inferred from the examples:\n\n1.  **Identify the Hub**: The central piece is a 3x3 square (typically yellow, color 4) with \"connectors\" (red pixels, color 2) on its sides.\n2.  **Identify the Pieces**: Other shapes in the grid are peripheral pieces. They also have red connectors.\n3.  **Connection Logic**: Pieces attach to the Hub (or to pieces already attached to the Hub) by matching their connectors.\n    *   A \"Male\" connector (protruding red pixel) matches a specific port or alignment.\n    *   The connection consumes/overlaps the red pixels.\n    *   Pieces may be **rotated** (90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0) to fit the ports.\n    *   The structure forms a tree: Hub -> Primary Pieces -> Secondary Pieces.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **The Hub**: Located at Rows 10-12, Columns 10-12 (Yellow 4s).\n    *   **Ports**:\n        *   **Left** (Top corner): Red pixel at (10, 9).\n        *   **Right** (Bottom corner): Red pixel at (12, 13).\n        *   **Bottom** (Center): Red pixel at (13, 11).\n\n2.  **Piece 1: Light Blue (8)** (Top Left in input)\n    *   Has a connector at its Top-Right corner.\n    *   Fits the **Hub's Left Port** at (10, 9).\n    *   Placement: Left of Hub.\n\n3.  **Piece 2: Green (3)** (Center Left in input)\n    *   Vertical bar with a connector at the bottom.\n    *   Matches **Hub's Bottom Port** if rotated 180\u00b0 (so connector is on top).\n    *   Placement: Below Hub.\n\n4.  **Piece 3: Blue (1)** (Bottom Left in input)\n    *   U-shape. Needs to fit **Hub's Right Port** at (12, 13).\n    *   If rotated 270\u00b0 (or -90\u00b0), it becomes a `]` shape with connectors on the left.\n    *   The bottom-left connector aligns with the Hub's right-bottom port.\n    *   Placement: Right of Hub.\n\n5.  **Piece 4: Gray (5)** (Middle Right in input)\n    *   Input is `n` shape (inverted U).\n    *   The Light Blue piece (now on the left) has an exposed connector at its bottom-left leg.\n    *   If Gray is rotated 180\u00b0 (to a U-shape), its top-left connector matches the Light Blue piece's bottom-left connector.\n    *   Placement: Below the Light Blue piece.\n\n6.  **Piece 5: Pink (6)** (Top Right in input)\n    *   Input is U-shape.\n    *   The Blue piece (now on the right) has an exposed connector at its top-left leg.\n    *   If Pink is rotated 180\u00b0 (to an `n` shape), its bottom-left connector matches the Blue piece's top-left connector.\n    *   Placement: Above the Blue piece.\n\n**Constructed Grid Coordinates (0-indexed):**\n*   **Hub**: (10,10) to (12,12).\n*   **Light Blue**: Rows 10-15, Cols 5-8.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can see the transformation assembles scattered colored shapes around a central yellow (4) 3x3 block. The red (2) markers serve as connection points between shapes.\n\n**Analyzing the pattern:**\n1. The yellow 3x3 block stays as the central anchor\n2. Each colored shape has red markers indicating where it connects\n3. Shapes are translated so their red markers align with the yellow block's red markers\n4. Shapes chain together through matching red connection points\n\n**For the test input:**\n- Yellow block at rows 10-12, cols 10-12\n- Red markers around yellow: (9,12) top, (10,9) left, (12,13) right, (13,11) bottom\n\n**Shape connections:**\n- **Cyan (8)** connects to yellow's left via red at (10,9) \u2192 shifted to rows 8-12, cols 5-8\n- **Green vertical (3)** connects to yellow's top via red at (9,12) \u2192 shifted to rows 6-8, col 12\n- **Blue (1)** connects to yellow's bottom via red at (13,11) \u2192 shifted to rows 13-17, cols 9-13\n- **Green large (3)** connects to blue's bottom-right \u2192 shifted to rows 17-21, cols 14-20\n- **Gray (5)** connects above green large \u2192 shifted to rows 13-16, cols 14-19\n- **Purple (6)** connects below green large \u2192 shifted to rows 21-24, cols 13-17\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,0,0,3,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,2,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,4,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Final Thoughts on the ARC Task:**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: the user wants me to solve this ARC problem. It's all about pattern recognition and spatial reasoning, which, let's be honest, is kind of my thing. They've given me a bunch of examples and a test input, and the task is to figure out the transformation rule and apply it. Sounds straightforward, right?\n\nFirst, I looked at the basic structure: a grid of numbers representing colors, and the goal is to transform this into a new grid. I quickly realized that the key is identifying what these shapes *do* and figuring out how they *interact.* The initial hints about translations, unchanged internal pixels, and connected components gave me a starting point. \"Red\" pixels (marked with the number 2) were the key.\n\nI started digging into the examples, particularly Example 1. It was like a puzzle, with all these different shapes \u2013 blue, teal, yellow, grey, green. It became clear that each of these shapes had \"ports,\" usually marked with red pixels, and the output grid showed these shapes being *assembled* in a new configuration. The red pixels weren't random; they acted as connectors, like little magnetic snaps. My first hypothesis was that they were somehow \"overlapping\".\n\nI focused on a central shape, the yellow block. It was the hub around which everything seemed to revolve. I analyzed the input and output coordinates of the red pixels on the yellow block and other shapes. The key was to track these pixels and their relationships to adjacent shapes.\n\nI meticulously traced how each shape moved in the output. Translation was the main operation \u2013 no rotations or fancy stuff, thank goodness. My thought process was to find a \"delta\" (a shift in coordinates) that put the red connector pixels on two shapes at the *same* location. It became clear that the red pixels, or \"ports,\" were the crucial parts.\n\nI kept testing the overlaps. If the shift worked for one set of connector pixels, it *had* to work for all of them. I'd calculate the Delta, apply it, and verify that the other connection points aligned in the output. This was critical to maintaining the components' integrity.\n\nOnce I nailed the rules, I looked at the test input and broke it down into its separate parts. I carefully extracted the pixel locations of all the shapes and their connectors. Then, it was all about applying the same logic: translating each component to make the connectors overlap.\n\nI got everything translated to the correct places. There may be some shifting from the top or left due to how the shapes fit. I had to build up the entire final result in a consistent, logical way, piece by piece, as if building a Lego model.\n\nFinally, I combined the individual pieces and ensured everything fit perfectly, making sure that red pixels still overlapped, and the output had a 26x26 grid of the numbers. I've double checked everything. Hopefully I got this right.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation involves assembling disconnected components into a single connected structure. The rules are:\n\n1.  **Identification of Components:** The input grid contains several distinct shapes (components) made of various colors. Each component has one or more **Red (2)** pixels on its boundary. These red pixels act as \"ports\" or \"connectors\".\n2.  **Assembly Logic:** The components are translated (without rotation) so that their red connectors overlap. A pair of red connectors from two different shapes will occupy the same coordinate in the final grid, fusing the shapes together.\n3.  **Topology:** The assembly typically centers around a core shape (like the yellow block in the examples/test). Other shapes plug into the core or into each other, forming a chain or cluster.\n\n**Step-by-Step Derivation for Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Components and Ports (Input Coordinates):**\n    *   **Yellow Block (4):** Core at rows 10-12. Ports at (9,12) [North], (10,9) [West], (12,13) [East], (13,11) [South].\n    *   **Teal Shape (8):** Top-left. Ports at (6,3) [Left Leg], (5,6) [Right Leg], (0,3) [Top], (1,7) & (3,7) [Right Side].\n    *   **Orange Shape (3):** Bottom-right. Ports at (21,10) & (23,10) [Left Side], (20,12) & (20,15) [Top].\n    *   **Blue Shape (1):** Bottom-left. Ports at (19,4) [Top Left], (20,2) [Left Leg], (24,2) & (24,6) [Bottom Legs].\n    *   **Pink Shape (6):** Top-right. Ports at (3,18) & (3,22) [Top of Legs].\n    *   **Grey Shape (5):** Right. Ports at (16,19) & (16,22) [Bottom].\n    *   **Green Shape (3):** Stick at col 4. Port at (14,4) [Bottom].\n\n2.  **Determine Connections and Translations:**\n    *   **Yellow as Anchor:** We place the Yellow block centrally. Let's apply a global shift of **(+2 rows, 0 cols)** to the Yellow input coordinates to fit the entire assembly in the grid (shifting it down slightly). New Yellow position: 4s at (12,10)-(14,12).\n    *   **Teal to Yellow:** Teal's bottom ports connect to Yellow's top/west ports.\n        *   Teal (6,3) connects to Yellow (10,9).\n        *   Teal (5,6) connects to Yellow (9,12).\n        *   **Translation:** Teal shifts **(+6, +6)**.\n    *   **Green to Teal:** Green's bottom port (14,4) connects to Teal's top port (0,3).\n        *   **Translation:** Green shifts **(-8, +5)**.\n    *   **Orange to Teal:** Orange's left ports connect to Teal's right ports.\n        *   Orange (21,10) connects to Teal (1,7).\n        *   Orange (23,10) connects to Teal (3,7).\n        *   **Translation:** Orange shifts **(-14, +3)**.\n    *   **Grey to Orange:** Grey's bottom ports connect to Orange's top ports.\n        *   Grey (16,19) connects to Orange (20,12).\n        *   Grey (16,22) connects to Orange (20,15).\n        *   **Translation:** Grey shifts **(-10, -4)**.\n    *   **Blue to Yellow:** Blue's top ports connect to Yellow's east/south ports.\n        *   Blue (19,4) connects to Yellow (12,13).\n        *   Blue (20,2) connects to Yellow (13,11).\n        *   **Translation:** Blue shifts **(-5, +9)**.\n    *   **Pink to Blue:** Pink's top ports connect to Blue's bottom ports.\n        *   Pink (3,18) connects to Blue (24,2).\n        *   Pink (3,22) connects to Blue (24,6).\n        *   **Translation:** Pink shifts **(+16, -7)**.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Using the calculated translations, we map every pixel from the input components to the output grid.\n    *   Red pixels (2) overlap perfectly at the interfaces.\n\n**Final Coordinates:**\n*   **Green (3):** Rows 3-5, col 9.\n*   **Grey (5):** Rows 1-5, cols 14-19.\n*   **Teal (8):** Rows 7-11, cols 9-12.\n*   **Orange (3):** Rows 7-10, cols 14-20.\n*   **Yellow (4):** Rows 12-14, cols 10-12.\n*   **Blue (1):** Rows 14-18, cols 14-15 (plus structure).\n*   **Pink (6):** Rows 20-22, cols 11-15.\n*   **Interfaces (2):** (6,9), (6,15), (6,18), (7,13), (9,13), (11,12), (12,9), (14,13), (15,11), (19,11), (19,15).\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

**yellow(+red)** block tends to land in a **junction-like** position within the assembled cluster.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Thoughts and Strategy**\n\nMy primary goal is to decipher this ARC task, focusing on how different shapes or components are assembled based on example inputs and a test input. I see a need to identify the rules behind the transformations, particularly the way these components are connected and arranged in the output grid.\n\n**Understanding the Visual Language**\n\nI'm noticing recurring patterns: large grids, several distinct shapes formed by non-zero pixels, and a range of colors. The color red (2) seems significant, often appearing as small connectors or accents on the components. The hints point to translation and the formation of a compact assembly, suggesting that shapes need to be moved and combined. Red pixels, based on the hints and initial observations, appear to act as a crucial mechanism to hold the parts together.\n\n**Examining Example 1 and Developing a Hypothesis**\n\nAnalyzing Example 1's input/output pairs, I observe that the input components get joined. I note a stacking structure where each shape appears to connect to the next through the red pixels. These red pixels might work as the connectors, allowing two pieces to attach to one another.\n\nThrough careful comparison of input and output grids, I refine my theory. Specifically, red pixels on one shape must align or overlap with red pixels on another shape, causing a fusion or contact. The red color acts as the 'glue' that binds these shapes into a single, comprehensive structure. In Example 1, I find a chain of vertically-stacked components with the yellow piece at the center.\n\n**Validating and Refinement**\n\nThe central concept in the problem appears to rely on a 'hook and socket' structure. Where a component has red pattern, it looks for another piece with the corresponding red pattern. These components are joined when they get translated to a position so their red patterns overlap. This gives an easy means to build a graph-like representation of the assembly, with a possible central \"hub\" (often Yellow) or chain structure.\n\nI double-check this idea with Example 2, confirming that the pieces connect through red pixels forming hooks. There can be an alignment through the use of an overlapping graph structure.\n\n**Tackling the Test Input**\n\nMoving to the test input, I need to use the rules found through my analysis of the examples to identify the components, find the hooking patterns, and assemble them in the right way.\n\n**Creating a Plan**\n\nI will perform the following steps:\n1. Identify each unique component based on color and connectivity.\n2. Determine red pixel patterns for each component.\n3. Calculate the translation needed to get the components to connect.\n4. Arrange components relative to a central shape (Yellow, most likely).\n5. Generate the output grid.\n\n**Making the Calculation**\n\nUsing the findings from prior analysis, I calculate the position where components overlap. The components now have an accurate description of where they should be placed to construct the output, following my prior calculations. I double check the alignment and create the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we need to assemble scattered components into a single connected object. Based on the examples and hints, the transformation rules are:\n1.  **Identify Components:** The input grid contains distinct shapes (components) made of colored pixels. Red pixels (value 2) are attached to these shapes and act as \"connectors\" or \"snaps\".\n2.  **Match Connectors:** Components connect where their red pixel patterns overlap or align. We need to find the correct translation for each component so that their red \"hooks\" engage with the corresponding \"hooks\" of other components.\n3.  **Assemble:** Once the relative positions are determined, we construct the final grid. The red pixels are typically preserved at the interface.\n\n**Component Analysis & Connections (Test Input):**\n\n*   **Yellow (4) Component:** The central hub.\n    *   *Body:* 3x3 block of `4`s.\n    *   *Hooks:* Top-Right, Left-Top, Right-Bottom, Bottom-Center.\n    *   *Positioning:* We place this centrally. Let's fix the Yellow 3x3 block at Output rows 10-12, cols 10-12.

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* The output keeps every input component\u2019s internal pixels unchanged; components are primarily **translated**.\n* Disconnected pieces in the input become a **single compact assembly** in the output.\n* **Red tiles** consistently stay attached to their pieces and often end up at **interfaces** between pieces in the assembled result.\n* The **yellow(+red)** block tends to land in a **junction-like** position within the assembled cluster.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to understand how disconnected pieces are assembled into a single compact structure.\n\n**Analysis of the transformation:**\n1. The yellow (4) 3\u00d73 block serves as the central anchor/junction\n2. Other colored pieces (each with their shape and red markers) are translated to connect to each other\n3. Red (2) markers indicate connection points - they end up at interfaces between pieces\n4. Pieces maintain their internal structure but are repositioned\n\n**Identifying the pieces in the test input:**\n- **Azure (8)**: rows 0-6, cols 3-7 - vertical rectangular shape\n- **Magenta (6)**: rows 3-6, cols 18-22 - inverted U shape  \n- **Yellow (4)**: rows 10-12, cols 10-12 - 3\u00d73 block (anchor)\n- **Gray (5)**: rows 11-15, cols 18-23 - frame shape\n- **Green vertical (3)**: rows 11-13, col 4 - small bar\n- **Blue (1)**: rows 19-24, cols 2-6 - L shape\n- **Green horizontal (3)**: rows 20-24, cols 10-17 - H-like shape\n\n**Assembly plan:**\n- Keep Yellow at its position (rows 10-12, cols 10-12)\n- Azure connects above Yellow (translation: +2 rows, +9 cols)\n- Gray connects to Azure's right side (translation: -8 rows, -1 col)\n- Magenta connects below Gray (translation: +4 rows, 0 cols)\n- Blue connects below Yellow (translation: -5 rows, +7 cols)\n- Green horizontal connects to Yellow's right (translation: -9 rows, +4 cols)\n- Green vertical connects between Yellow and Blue on the left (translation: 0 rows, +5 cols)\n\nThe red markers align at interfaces: Azure\u2194Yellow, Yellow\u2194Blue, Yellow\u2194Green horizontal, Gray\u2194Magenta, Azure\u2194Gray, Green vertical\u2194Blue.\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,4,4,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,4,4,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,1,1,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

become a **single compact assembly** in the output.\n* **Red tiles** consistently stay attached to their pieces and often end up at **interfaces** between pieces in the assembled result.\n* The **yellow(+red)** block tends to land in a **junction-like** position within the assembled cluster.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct

            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation\n\n1. **Split the input into connected components** (4-neighbor connectivity).  \n   Each component may contain multiple colors; **red (2) pixels belong to their component** and move with it.\n\n2. **Treat red pixels as \u201cconnectors\u201d.**  \n   Components are **translated (no rotation)** so that **some red pixels from different components overlap exactly** (red-on-red overlap is allowed). These overlaps become the **interfaces** that join pieces into one connected cluster. All other colored pixels must not overlap.\n\n3. **Use the yellow block (color 4) as the anchor.**  \n   As in the examples, the component containing **yellow (4)** stays **fixed in place**, and all other components are moved to attach to it (directly or indirectly) via red connector matches.\n\n4. **Match connector patterns to assemble compactly.**  \n   In this test:\n   - The **azure (8)** component has two red connectors with the same relative offset as the **yellow\u2019s top+left** red connectors \u21d2 dock azure onto those two reds.\n   - The **blue (1)** component has two red connectors with the same relative offset as the **yellow\u2019s right+bottom** red connectors \u21d2 dock blue onto those two reds.\n   - The remaining **azure right-side red pair** matches the **large green (3) left-side red pair** \u21d2 attach green to azure.\n   - The **green top red pair** matches the **gray (5) bottom red pair** \u21d2 attach gray above green.\n   - The **blue bottom red pair** matches the **magenta (6) top red pair** \u21d2 attach magenta below blue.\n   - The small **green (3) stick** attaches via its single red connector to the remaining top red on the azure piece.\n\nThe output is the union of all these translated components, with everything else set to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\n### Pair 1\n**Input 1**\n- A black background grid with **five** separated multi-color components.\n- Each component is mostly a single \u201cmain\u201d color with a few **red** tiles attached on its outer edges/corners:\n  1) **Blue** hollow square/frame-like object (black interior), located in the upper-left area. Red tiles appear attached along its outer perimeter (not inside the hole).\n  2) **Light-blue/cyan** \u201cpillar/legs\u201d shape (two vertical parts connected near the top), in the upper-right area, with red tiles at some endpoints.\n  3) **Yellow** solid square/block near the center, with red tiles adjacent around it (on multiple sides).\n  4) **Green** arch-like shape near bottom-left, with red tiles attached at its lower ends.\n  5) **Gray** bracket/frame segment near bottom-right, with red tiles attached at some corners/endpoints.\n- All components are separated by black space (no touching).\n\n**Output 1**\n- Same black background and the **same five components** (same colors/shapes, including their red attachments).\n- The components are **repositioned** into a single compact grouping:\n  - Green ends up above cyan,\n  - cyan above yellow,\n  - blue below/near yellow,\n  - gray attached on the right side of the lower part of the cluster.\n- No new colors appear; no components are missing.\n\n### Pair 2\n**Input 2**\n- A black background grid with **five** separated components again:\n  1) **Blue** bracket-like piece on the left side, with red tiles at some endpoints.\n  2) **Yellow** solid square/block near center, with red tiles adjacent around it.\n  3) **Green** bracket-like piece near the right-middle, with red tiles at endpoints.\n  4) **Magenta** arch-like piece near top-right, with red tiles at its lower ends.\n  5) **Light-blue/cyan** arch-like piece near bottom-center, with red tiles at its ends.\n- Components are separated (not touching).\n\n**Output 2**\n- Same black background and the **same five components**, unchanged in internal shape/color.\n- They are **rearranged into a compact cluster** where:\n  - magenta and cyan appear in the upper part,\n  - blue and green appear in the lower part,\n  - yellow sits between/near the lower middle.\n- The arrangement visually forms two \u201cframe-like\u201d regions with black interiors (hollows) in the clustered result.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement:** **present**\n- **Object recoloring:** **absent**\n- **Bordering / outlining:** **absent**\n- **Filling holes or cavities:** **absent**\n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** **absent**\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** **present** (repositioning without duplication is clearly happening)\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center):** **maybe** (outputs place the packed cluster in a consistent \u201ccentral-ish\u201d area, but anchor choice isn\u2019t fully proven)\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** **maybe** (red and yellow look \u201cspecial\u201d but the dependency is not confirmed)\n- **Size-based filtering or selection:** **absent**\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations:** **maybe** (Output 2 looks more symmetric than Input 2, but not enough evidence)\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** **absent**\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** **absent**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **Whole components are preserved exactly**: across both examples, each output object looks like a **pure translation** of an input connected component (no rotation, reflection, resizing, or internal edits).\n2. **Red tiles behave like \u201cendpoints\u201d**: red tiles always remain attached to their original component and, in the outputs, many red tiles end up located at the **interfaces** where different components come close together.\n3. **The main effect is \u201cscattered \u2192 assembled\u201d**: inputs have disconnected pieces spread out; outputs bring *all* pieces into a **single compact assembly** (tight packing with purposeful adjacency).\n4. **Yellow block tends to sit at a junction**: in both outputs, the yellow(+red) component is not placed on an outer extreme; it lands in a position consistent with being a **linking/intermediate** piece in the assembled cluster.\n5. **Output 2 suggests pairing to create larger hollow frames**: the final cluster visually contains two similar frame-like \u201cwindows,\u201d implying the rearrangement may be guided by complementary shapes/ends rather than arbitrary packing.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nA plausible mechanism is: **identify each disconnected multi-color component and translate them (without rotation) to form a single compact structure**, where **red-marked endpoints** determine how pieces should be brought into contact (touching/aligning at or near red tiles). The final assembled structure is then placed in a consistent location within the grid (often near the center of the available space).\n\nAlternative (less certain) family: pieces are grouped into roles (e.g., \u201ctop\u201d vs \u201cbottom\u201d segments) and arranged into a canonical composite (such as one or two hollow frames) with the yellow block acting as a central connector.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks to perform when solving\n\n1. **Component invariance check:** for each output component, verify it matches an input component under translation only (same shape, same red placements relative to main color).\n2. **Connector adjacency check:** test whether red tiles in the output are systematically **adjacent/overlapping** between different components more than would happen by random packing.\n3. **Build a \u201cconnection graph\u201d:** treat red tiles (or red+main-color boundary tiles) as candidate ports; see if the output arrangement corresponds to a consistent port-matching strategy.\n4. **Anchor/placement check:** compute the bounding box of the assembled cluster; verify if it is consistently centered or aligned to a particular corner/edge.\n5. **Pairing pattern check:** in cases like Output 2, detect whether certain shape types (arches vs brackets) always stack/combine to form closed frames.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* The output keeps every input component\u2019s internal pixels unchanged; components are primarily **translated**.\n* Disconnected pieces in the input become a **single compact assembly** in the output.\n* **Red tiles** consistently stay attached to their pieces and often end up at **interfaces** between pieces in the assembled result.\n* The **yellow(+red)** block tends to land in a **junction-like** position within the assembled cluster.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **U-Shaped Frames:** Open-top rectangular shapes in colors 1, 3, 5, 6, or 8. Often tipped with color 2 pixels at the opening.\n2.  **Solid Blocks:** 3x3 filled squares of color 4. Often flanked by color 2 pixels on opposite sides (top/bottom or left/right).\n3.  **Marker Pixels:** Single pixels of color 2 attached to the extremities of frames or the perimeter of blocks.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Identify pieces: frames in 1/3/5/6/8 together with their attached 2 markers, and the 3x3 block of 4 (with its local 2 markers).\n- Keep the 4 block (and its block-markers 2) fixed in place.\n- Translate every other piece rigidly (no rotation/flip/resize/recolor).\n- Reassemble pieces by aligning/overlapping 2 marker pixels; overlapping markers stay color 2 and form the joints.\n- Set all original (now-empty) positions to 0; output is otherwise 0-filled with the assembled structure around the fixed 4 block.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the user wants me to tackle an ARC task. My job is to analyze two example input/output pairs to figure out the underlying transformation rules. It seems like a spatial reasoning puzzle with connected components and marker pixels. The goal is to describe how each piece (colors) of the input gets moved and possibly reshaped into the output.\n\n**Example 1: In-Depth Analysis**\n\nI'm starting by carefully examining Example 1. I'll break it down into pieces by their colors, paying close attention to any \"marker pixels\" (color 2), as the instructions indicate these play a role in connecting the pieces.\n\n-   **Piece 1 (Blue \"U\"):** Traced the ASCII representation and then the text representation and had to reconcile two different ideas about where its markers were. It looks like a U lying down, sort of like a C, has markers where the legs would be and markers at the very bottom too.\n\n-   **Piece 2 (Greyish 4):** Identified this early and knew this would be the fixed anchor piece. Traced markers that were adjacent.\n\n-   **Piece 3 (Black 5)**: A C-shape. Determined its markers from tracing.\n\n-   **Piece 4 (Green 3):** Determined to be a U shape. Determined markers by reading the data.\n\nI initially hypothesized a simple translation rule, fixing the 4-block and moving other pieces to align markers. I found the markers of the cyan piece were at the bottom and matched the top of the fixed block. I went through the calculations to make sure all the markers fit where they should.\n\n**Key Transformation: Translation and Overlapping Markers**\n\nI determined the critical transformation is a translation of pieces, relative to a fixed anchor block. I found that not all pieces had two markers, but that this was not important. Some markers overlapped the fixed block markers and stayed. I found that I made an error identifying the right markers at the top and bottom of the cyan shape, so I had to re-examine those in the data. I realized that some marker pixel pairs lined up with markers on the fixed block - it was a vertical line going from the fixed block.\n\n**Iterative Refinement and Hypothesis Testing**\n\nThe first translation worked, but I also had to re-verify the marker indices, as the diagram was ambiguous, and sometimes I would mis-trace the information from the diagrams or the textual data. I had to go back and check. I found that I was missing markers at the top of the cyan piece, which led me to think the original assumption of two connections was flawed. I checked that the data was not a flip or rotation - this was a pure translation with markers staying, so that if one piece had markers on the same pixels as another (from before the translation) those markers would still be valid in the translated positions. I looked at the color 3 piece, and that the translation was the same.\n\n**Developing a General Model**\n\nThrough this process, I refined the model:\n\n1.  **Parse:** The grid into connected color components (pieces), identifying the anchor (fixed 4-block) and markers (color 2).\n2.  **Connections:** Establish the graph of connections between the pieces and the anchor. Matching happened by aligning marker pixels.\n3.  **No Rotation:** Pure translation (shift) is the only allowed operation.\n4.  **Overlap:** Overlapping markers between pieces are \"joints\".\n\n**Example 2: Verification and Model Application**\n\nWith the general model in hand, I moved on to Example 2 to validate. I identified the 4-block's markers first.\n\n-   **Pink U-Shape (6)**: Its markers did not match with others, so this indicated some sort of attachment.\n-   **Blue Vertical Bar (1)**: This had a marker hanging down, and it connected to the fixed block.\n-   **Green 3**: This has horizontal and vertical components. I realized there were two color 3s.\n-   **Cyan 8**\n\nThrough carefully matching marker patterns, I built the connectivity graph. I found the following:\n\n1.  **Fixed 4-block**: I found the markers.\n2.  **6-piece** sat on 1-piece, at the top.\n3.  **8-piece** had the markers.\n4.  **1-piece**: connected to the left of the fixed block.\n5.  **3-piece**: connected to the 8-piece, top.\n6.  **Another 3**: These hung off the fixed block, to the side.\n\nI had to be systematic in matching up potential transformations between the initial setup and where the pieces were now.\nThen I traced the translations.\n\nI identified the following shifts:\n\n-   \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to assemble a set of \"pieces\" scattered around the grid into a single connected structure. The assembly instructions are defined by the positions of the \"marker\" pixels (color 2).\n\n### Step-by-Step Logic\n\n1.  **Identify the Anchor:**\n    The solid 3x3 block of color 4 is the fixed central piece. All other pieces will be moved relative to it.\n    *   **Anchor Location:** Rows 11-13, Columns 10-12.\n    *   **Anchor Markers:**\n        *   Top: (9, 12)\n        *   Left: (10, 9)\n        *   Right: (12, 13)\n        *   Bottom: (13, 11)\n\n2.  **Identify the Pieces:**\n    We parse the grid to find connected shapes (frames/blocks) and their attached markers (color 2).\n    *   **Piece A (Cyan 8):** Top-left. Markers at (6, 3) [Bottom-Left], (5, 6) [Bottom-Right], (3, 7) [Side], (1, 7) [Top].\n    *   **Piece B (Pink 6):** Top-right. Inverted U-shape. Markers at (3, 18), (3, 22).\n    *   **Piece C (Grey 5):** Middle-right. Rectangular C-shape. Markers at (15, 19), (15, 22).\n    *   **Piece D (Green 3):** Middle-left. Vertical line. Marker at (14, 4).\n    *   **Piece E (Blue 1):** Bottom-left. Box shape. Markers at (19, 4), (20, 2), (24, 2), (24, 6).\n    *   **Piece F (Green 3):** Bottom-right. Complex shape. Markers at (21, 10), (23, 10), (20, 12), (20, 15).\n\n3.  **Determine Connections (Transformation):**\n    We look for geometric matches between the arrangement of markers on the Anchor and the markers on the pieces.\n    \n    *   **Connecting Piece A:**\n        The Anchor has markers at Left (10, 9) and Top (9, 12). The relative offset is (Row -1, Col +3).\n        Piece A has markers at (6, 3) and (5, 6). Relative offset is (Row -1, Col +3).\n        **Action:** Move Piece A so (6, 3) overlaps Anchor(10, 9). Shift: **(+4, +6)**.\n        New Marker positions for A: (3, 7) -> (7, 13) and (1, 7) -> (5, 13).\n\n    *   **Connecting Piece E:**\n        The Anchor has markers at Bottom (13, 11) and Right (12, 13). Relative offset is (Row +1, Col -2).\n        Piece E has markers at (20, 2) and (19, 4). Relative offset is (Row +1, Col -2).\n        **Action:** Move Piece E so (20, 2) overlaps Anchor(13, 11). Shift: **(-7, +9)**.\n        (19, 4) moves to (12, 13).\n        New Marker positions for E: (24, 2) -> (17, 11) and (24, 6) -> (17, 15).\n\n    *   **Connecting Piece D:**\n        Piece D has a single marker at (14, 4).\n        The Anchor's Right marker (12, 13) is also occupied by Piece E's top marker (19, 4) -> (12, 13).\n        Piece D fits into the vertical gap at Column 13 above the marker.\n        **Action:** Move Piece D so (14, 4) overlaps Anchor(12, 13).

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **U-Shaped Frames:** Open-top rectangular shapes in colors 1, 3, 5, 6, or 8. Often tipped with color 2 pixels at the opening.\n2.  **Solid Blocks:** 3x3 filled squares of color 4. Often flanked by color 2 pixels on opposite sides (top/bottom or left/right).\n3.  **Marker Pixels:** Single pixels of color 2 attached to the extremities of frames or the perimeter of blocks.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Identify pieces: frames in 1/3/5/6/8 together with their attached 2 markers, and the 3x3 block of 4 (with its local 2 markers).\n- Keep the 4 block (and its block-markers 2) fixed in place.\n- Translate every other piece rigidly (no rotation/flip/resize/recolor).\n- Reassemble pieces by aligning/overlapping 2 marker pixels; overlapping markers stay color 2 and form the joints.\n- Set all original (now-empty) positions to 0; output is otherwise 0-filled with the assembled structure around the fixed 4 block.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Assembly Analysis: ARC Task Solution**\n\nAlright, let's break down this ARC problem. The goal is to take a set of \"objects\" in a grid, one of which is fixed (a 3x3 block), and assemble the others by translating them so that their markers align with the markers on the fixed block or other already-attached objects. The key is rigid translation \u2013 no rotations or flips.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the objects:\n\n*   **U-Shaped Frames:** These open-top shapes are the main moving components, made of specific colors (1, 3, 5, 6, 8), and have marker pixels (color 2) at their \"tips.\"\n*   **Solid Blocks:** The fixed 3x3 block (color 4) has markers on its perimeter.\n*   **Markers:** Color 2 pixels are the \"connectors\" that determine how the pieces fit together.\n\n**The Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Objects:**  Find the fixed block (easy, it's always the 3x3 of color 4) and then locate the U-shapes.\n2.  **Determine the Markers:** Figure out where the marker pixels are located on each object, as they will determine how each object connects to other components in the assembly.\n3.  **Trace Object Connections:**  Look at the \"connection points\" on the fixed block to determine where the various objects will be attached.\n4.  **Translation Vectors:** Calculate how each object moves (the \"translation vector\") to align its markers with the correct markers. The key is to check that the resulting location of the other parts of the object are within the output size constraints and that they don't overlap with another (non-marker) solid section from other pieces.\n5.  **Assemble and Clean Up:**  Translate the objects and \"connect\" the markers (i.e., make them all color 2).  The original object locations become background (0).\n\n**Detailed Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI started by looking closely at Example 1: a larger grid with several U-shapes around a 3x3 block.  It looks complicated, but by meticulously going row by row and comparing the input and output, I began to see the logic.\n\n*   I traced how the different objects were positioned by noting their colors and markers. I saw that the objects were moving and, crucially, not rotating. The '8' at the top left flipped; this implies a 180 flip. If no explicit transformation/flip/rotation is mentioned in the problem statement then no operation must be done.\n*   The 3x3 solid block stays in place. The moving \"U\" shapes translated to align their marker pixels with the markers on the 4-block.\n\n**Key Observations from Example 1:**\n\n1.  **Markers as Guides:** The marker pixels are the key. They *must* be connected (i.e., they *must* overlap, forming a single color 2 pixel in the final assembly).\n2.  **Chain Structure:** The objects attach to each other in a chain-like fashion.  The markers on each object \"link\" to a fixed spot (either on the block, or on another object).\n3.  **Overlaps:** Marker pixels overlap to make an assembly. If they overlap then the resulting pixels is the color 2.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nI turned my attention to the test input, a 26x26 grid. I'm looking for the same pattern - U-shapes moving to the block!\n\n*   **Locating the Block:** The 3x3 block is at a specific location, and I found the markers.\n*   **U-shape locations:** I identified U-shapes, noticing that they have specific orientations.  For a given U-shape, it's markers are specific.\n*   **Connectivity:** Next, I had to work out how these various U-shapes should fit together. This is where I started drawing lines, noting positions, and calculating translation vectors.\n*   **Open Spot:** The key discovery was there are 4 main connection points on the block. The assembly fills around the block, like a puzzle. One of the pieces in the test input ends at an \"open spot\" on the frame.\n*   **Dangling Marker:** It seems I get a \"dangling\" marker (that is, an unconnected color 2 pixel) for one object, in the assembly; I checked the other examples, and it seems that this might be acceptable.\n\n**Construction of Output:**\n\nWith the connection logic in place, I will now construct the final output:\n1.  **Initialize Grid:** Create a grid the same size as the input, filled with 0s.\n2.  **Place Objects:**\n    \n\nThe transformation involves identifying a central fixed object (the 4-block) and several movable frames or pieces. The pieces are rigidly translated so that their \"marker\" pixels (color 2) overlap with the markers of the fixed object or the markers of already-attached pieces. This forms a single connected structure.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Fixed Object:**\n    -   A 3x3 block of `4`s is located at rows 10-12, columns 10-12.\n    -   It has connection markers (color `2`) at:\n        -   Top: (9, 12)\n        -   Left: (10, 9)\n        -   Right: (12, 13)\n        -   Bottom: (13, 11)\n\n2.  **Identify Movable Pieces and their Markers:**\n    -   **Piece 3 (Vertical):** Columns 4, Rows 11-14. Marker at bottom (14, 4).\n    -   **Piece 3 (Right Shape):** Columns 10-17, Rows 20-24. Markers at top (20, 12), (20, 15) and left (21, 10).\n    -   **Piece 5 (Mid Right):** Columns 18-23, Rows 11-15. Markers at bottom (15, 19), (15, 22).\n    -   **Piece 8 (Top Left):** Columns 3-7, Rows 0-5. Markers at top (0, 3), right (1, 7), (3, 7), bottom (5, 6).\n    -   **Piece 1 (Bottom Left):** Columns 2-6, Rows 19-24. Markers at top (19, 4), bottom (24, 2), (24, 6).\n    -   **Piece 6 (Top Right):** Columns 18-22, Rows 3-6. Markers at top (3, 18), (3, 22).\n\n3.  **Determine Translations:**\n    -   **Piece 3 (Vertical)** attaches to the Top of the 4-block. Align (14, 4) with (9, 12). Translation: `row - 5, col + 8`.\n    -   **Piece 3 (Right Shape)** attaches to the Bottom and Right of the 4-block. Align (21, 10) with (13, 11) and (20, 12) with (12, 13). Translation: `row - 8, col + 1`. This exposes a new marker at (12, 16).\n    -   **Piece 5** attaches to the new marker on Piece 3. Align (15, 19) with (12, 16). Translation: `row - 3, col - 3`. This exposes a new marker at (12, 19).\n    -   **Piece 8** attaches to the Left of the 4-block. Align (1, 7) with (10, 9). Translation: `row + 9, col + 2`. This exposes a new marker at (14, 8) (from original 5, 6).\n    -   **Piece 1** attaches to the bottom of Piece 8. Align (19, 4) with (14, 8). Translation: `row - 5, col + 4`. This exposes new markers at (19, 6) and (19, 10) (from original 24, 2 and 24, 6).\n    -   **Piece 6** attaches to the bottom of Piece 1. Align (3, 18) with (19, 6) and (3, 22) with (19, 10).

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **U-Shaped Frames:** Open-top rectangular shapes in colors 1, 3, 5, 6, or 8. Often tipped with color 2 pixels at the opening.\n2.  **Solid Blocks:** 3x3 filled squares of color 4. Often flanked by color 2 pixels on opposite sides (top/bottom or left/right).\n3.  **Marker Pixels:** Single pixels of color 2 attached to the extremities of frames or the perimeter of blocks.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Identify pieces: frames in 1/3/5/6/8 together with their attached 2 markers, and the 3x3 block of 4 (with its local 2 markers).\n- Keep the 4 block (and its block-markers 2) fixed in place.\n- Translate every other piece rigidly (no rotation/flip/resize/recolor).\n- Reassemble pieces by aligning/overlapping 2 marker pixels; overlapping markers stay color 2 and form the joints.\n- Set all original (now-empty) positions to 0; output is otherwise 0-filled with the assembled structure around the fixed 4 block.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **U-Shaped Frames:** Open-top rectangular shapes in colors 1, 3, 5, 6, or 8. Often tipped with color 2 pixels at the opening.\n2.  **Solid Blocks:** 3x3 filled squares of color 4. Often flanked by color 2 pixels on opposite sides (top/bottom or left/right).\n3.  **Marker Pixels:** Single pixels of color 2 attached to the extremities of frames or the perimeter of blocks.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Identify pieces: frames in 1/3/5/6/8 together with their attached 2 markers, and the 3x3 block of 4 (with its local 2 markers).\n- Keep the 4 block (and its block-markers 2) fixed in place.\n- Translate every other piece rigidly (no rotation/flip/resize/recolor).\n- Reassemble pieces by aligning/overlapping 2 marker pixels; overlapping markers stay color 2 and form the joints.\n- Set all original (now-empty) positions to 0; output is otherwise 0-filled with the assembled structure around the fixed 4 block.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### How the transformation works (reconstructable)\n\n1. **Treat each colored shape as a rigid \u201cpiece\u201d**:\n   - For every connected component of colors **1,3,5,6,8**, include all adjacent **2** pixels as that piece\u2019s *markers*.\n   - The **3\u00d73 block of 4** (and its adjacent **2** markers) is the **anchor** and stays fixed.\n\n2. **Assemble by matching marker geometry** (the key is that pairs of markers have distinctive offsets):\n   - The fixed 4-block has a marker pair with offset **( +1 row, \u22123 cols )**.  \n     The only piece with the same marker-pair offset is the **8-piece**, so translate the 8-piece so those two markers land on the block\u2019s matching two markers.\n   - The block also has a marker pair with offset **( +1 row, \u22122 cols )**.  \n     The **1-piece** contains the same offset between two of its markers, so translate it so those markers overlap the block\u2019s corresponding pair.\n   - The remaining two markers of the **1-piece** are **4 columns apart**; the **6-piece** has its two markers also **4 columns apart**, so translate the 6-piece so its two markers overlap those.\n   - Two remaining markers on the **8-piece** are **2 rows apart in the same column**; the large **3 \u201cC\u201d piece** has exactly such a vertical marker pair, so translate the big 3-piece so those markers overlap the 8-piece\u2019s pair.\n   - The remaining two markers on that big 3-piece are **3 columns apart**; the **5-piece** has its two markers **3 columns apart**, so translate the 5-piece so those overlap.\n   - The last free marker on the **8-piece** overlaps with the single marker of the small **3-line** piece, fixing its placement.\n\n3. **Overlay all translated pieces**:\n   - Where markers overlap, the cell remains **2**.\n   - All other cells are the pieces\u2019 colors; everything else is **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **U-Shaped Frames:** Open-top rectangular shapes in colors 1, 3, 5, 6, or 8. Often tipped with color 2 pixels at the opening.\n2.  **Solid Blocks:** 3x3 filled squares of color 4. Often flanked by color 2 pixels on opposite sides (top/bottom or left/right).\n3.  **Marker Pixels:** Single pixels of color 2 attached to the extremities of frames or the perimeter of blocks.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Identify pieces: frames in 1/3/5/6/8 together with their attached 2 markers, and the 3x3 block of 4 (with its local 2 markers).\n- Keep the 4 block (and its block-markers 2) fixed in place.\n- Translate every other piece rigidly (no rotation/flip/resize/recolor).\n- Reassemble pieces by aligning/overlapping 2 marker pixels; overlapping markers stay color 2 and form the joints.\n- Set all original (now-empty) positions to 0; output is otherwise 0-filled with the assembled structure around the fixed 4 block.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "### How the transformation works (inferred from the examples)\n\n1. **Split the scene into \u201cpieces\u201d.**\n   - The **3\u00d73 block of color 4** (and the color\u20112 pixels directly attached to it) is the **anchor** and does **not move**.\n   - Every other colored object (frames in colors 1/3/5/6/8) is a rigid piece, and its **adjacent color\u20112 pixels** are its **markers**.\n\n2. **Markers are connection joints.**  \n   Pieces are reassembled by translating them so that **marker pixels overlap**.  \n   In practice, most joins are determined by matching **pairs of markers**:\n   - If piece A has two markers with displacement vector **v** between them, and piece B has two markers with the *same* displacement **v**, then A can be translated so that both markers coincide with B\u2019s two markers (this uniquely determines the translation).\n\n3. **Assemble everything around the fixed 4\u2011block.**\n   - Find which marker-pairs match (same displacement).\n   - Use those to compute translations, starting from the fixed block and propagating outward.\n   - Wherever markers overlap, the cell remains color **2**.\n   - All other cells not covered by the moved pieces become **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Applying this to the test input\n\n**Fixed anchor (color 4 block):** at rows 10\u201312, cols 10\u201312, with attached markers at  \n(9,12), (10,9), (12,13), (13,11).\n\nNow match marker-pairs by equal displacement:\n\n- **6-piece** markers: (3,18)\u2013(3,22) has vector **(0,4)**  \n  Matches **1-piece** markers: (24,2)\u2013(24,6) also **(0,4)** \u2192 these connect.\n\n- **5-piece** markers: (15,19)\u2013(15,22) has vector **(0,3)**  \n  Matches **large 3-piece** markers: (20,12)\u2013(20,15) also **(0,3)** \u2192 these connect.\n\n- **large 3-piece** remaining pair: (21,10)\u2013(23,10) has vector **(2,0)**  \n  Matches **8-piece** markers: (1,7)\u2013(3,7) also **(2,0)** \u2192 these connect.\n\n- **8-piece** markers: (5,6)\u2013(6,3) has vector **(1,-3)**  \n  Matches **block** markers: (9,12)\u2013(10,9) also **(1,-3)** \u2192 8 connects to the block here.\n\n- **1-piece** other pair: (19,4)\u2013(20,2) has vector **(1,-2)**  \n  Matches **block** markers: (12,13)\u2013(13,11) also **(1,-2)** \u2192 1 connects to the block here.\n\n- The **small 3-piece** has a single marker (14,4). The only remaining unused marker on the 8-piece is (0,3); after placing 8, that marker lands at (4,9), so we align (14,4) \u2192 (4,9) to attach the small 3-piece.\n\nThese matches determine the translations and therefore the final assembled layout below.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid (26\u00d726)\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

                "response": "**Analyzing Object Types in Grids**\n\nAlright, let's break down these grids. Immediately, I see a constant color 0 background. It forms the canvas for everything else. Now, I'm focusing on the objects themselves, not their relationships.\n\nFirst, we have U-shaped objects. These are essentially rectangular frames with the top side missing. They come in various colors: 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8. The unique thing is that the two top pixels, the \"tips\" of the 'U', are frequently pixels of color 2. These are the main object types that appear throughout.\n\nNext, we have solid, 3x3 square blocks, which are consistently color 4. They're always the same size and color. What's interesting is that these blocks often have color 2 pixels adjacent to them. Usually this happens on the top/bottom or left/right sides.\n\nFinally, we have these isolated, single pixels of color 2. They appear to be \"markers\" because they are attached to or located near the other objects. They indicate the \"opening\" of the U-shaped frames or attach to the square blocks. So there are essentially three object types with associated attributes in the data: the U-shaped structures, solid squares, and marker pixels.\n\n\nBased on the visual data provided in the grids, the objects can be categorized into three distinct types based on their geometry, color usage, and structural attributes.\n\n**1. U-Shaped Structures (Containers)**\n*   **Geometry:** These objects form a rectangular shape that is open at the top, resembling a 'U' or a cup. They consist of a horizontal bottom row and two vertical side columns.\n*   **Colors:** The main body of these structures appears in various colors, specifically color 1, color 3, color 5, color 6, and color 8.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   The height and width of these structures vary.\n    *   A defining feature is the presence of pixels of color 2 located at the top tips of the vertical columns (the \"opening\" of the container). In some instances, the tips are the same color as the body, but frequently they are capped with color 2.\n\n**2. Solid Square Blocks**\n*   **Geometry:** These are solid, filled squares, consistently 3x3 pixels in size.\n*   **Colors:** The core of these squares is exclusively color 4.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   These blocks are often associated with pixels of color 2.\n    *   The color 2 pixels typically appear immediately adjacent to the center pixel of the block's outer edges\u2014either flanking the left and right sides, or the top and bottom sides.\n\n**3. Marker Pixels**\n*   **Geometry:** Single pixels.\n*   **Colors:** Exclusively color 2.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   These pixels do not appear in isolation as random noise but are structurally attached to the other two object types.\n    *   They act as \"caps\" on the U-shaped structures or \"anchors\" on the sides of the solid square blocks.\n\n**Background**\n*   The background field is consistently filled with color 0.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1.  **U-Shaped Frames:** Open-top rectangular shapes in colors 1, 3, 5, 6, or 8. Often tipped with color 2 pixels at the opening.\n2.  **Solid Blocks:** 3x3 filled squares of color 4. Often flanked by color 2 pixels on opposite sides (top/bottom or left/right).\n3.  **Marker Pixels:** Single pixels of color 2 attached to the extremities of frames or the perimeter of blocks.\n</objects_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **U-Shaped Frames:** Open-top rectangular shapes in colors 1, 3, 5, 6, or 8. Often tipped with color 2 pixels at the opening.\n2.  **Solid Blocks:** 3x3 filled squares of color 4. Often flanked by color 2 pixels on opposite sides (top/bottom or left/right).\n3.  **Marker Pixels:** Single pixels of color 2 attached to the extremities of frames or the perimeter of blocks.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Identify pieces: frames in 1/3/5/6/8 together with their attached 2 markers, and the 3x3 block of 4 (with its local 2 markers).\n- Keep the 4 block (and its block-markers 2) fixed in place.\n- Translate every other piece rigidly (no rotation/flip/resize/recolor).\n- Reassemble pieces by aligning/overlapping 2 marker pixels; overlapping markers stay color 2 and form the joints.\n- Set all original (now-empty) positions to 0; output is otherwise 0-filled with the assembled structure around the fixed 4 block.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
