        "Full raw LLM response": "**The Algorithm for ARC Puzzle Solving**\n\nAlright, let's break down this ARC problem. The task is to take a set of shapes in an input grid, and somehow translate that into a new, differently sized, grid. It's not a straightforward scaling or copying, there's some kind of logic at play. I've analyzed two example cases to uncover the pattern. It seems there is a core algorithm that involves the following steps:\n1.  **Identify 4 Main Shapes** In a complex grid, there's usually a central region containing a code. Identify this region's shape and assign it as Shape A. Find the other three distinct shapes. These are your shape pool, A, B, C, and D.\n2.  **Locate the Hidden Code** Inside that central region, there is a coded structure of pixels. This code has important details. The inner pixels within this primary shape serve as a mapping key.\n3.  **Determine Output Grid Structure** Analyze input/output size ratios in given examples.\n4.  **Map Shapes to Output Quadrants** Arrange your Shapes A, B, C and D across your new grid. The arrangement has rules, discovered in Ex 1 and Ex 2. The code in the primary shape maps to relative positions on the new grid. Specifically, it seems to encode a \"quadrant\" mapping.\n5.  **Assign Colors** Assign the colors, from each shapes to locations in your new output. The code's colors specify the color mapping between regions on the input and output grids.\n6.  **Shape Assembly** In the output grid, the new shapes are tiled together. The shapes are assembled and adjusted to create the new overall output.\n7.  **Shape Z-Indexing** Resolve conflicts when shapes overlap in certain locations.\n\nIn the Test input, the key challenge lies in the overlap. It seems shapes are cropped, merged, or z-indexed to make the resulting shape. I will assume a Z-index on code values such that, in an overlap, the shape with higher code gets priority. So, let's assemble the test based on these points.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we transform a 26x26 input grid into an output grid based on patterns inferred from two examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid contains four distinct colored shapes (connected components of non-zero integers).\n    *   In the Test Input, these are:\n        *   **Maroon (9)**: A large shape in the Top-Left.\n        *   **Grey (5)**: A large shape in the Top-Right.\n        *   **Orange (7)**: A smaller shape in the Bottom-Left.\n        *   **Red (2)**: A smaller shape in the Bottom-Right.\n\n2.  **The \"Code\":** One of the shapes contains a 2x2 pattern of \"intruder\" pixels (colors different from the shape's main color). This 2x2 pattern acts as a key for the output.\n    *   In Example 1, the Top-Left Red shape contained: `1 5` on the top row and `8 9` on the bottom row.\n    *   In Example 2, the Top-Left (relative) Magenta shape contained: `2 4` / `8 3`.\n    *   In the **Test Input**, the Maroon (9) shape contains the code. Looking at rows 5-6 (global) and cols 4-5 (relative to the shape's interior):\n        *   Row 5: `... 9, 3, 6, 9 ...` -> Top row of code is **3, 6**.\n        *   Row 6: `... 9, 4, 8, 9 ...` -> Bottom row of code is **4, 8**.\n    *   The Code is:\n        ```\n        3 6\n        4 8\n        ```\n    *   This Code defines the color and relative position of the four shapes in the output grid:\n        *   **Top-Left (TL): Color 3 (Green)**\n        *   **Top-Right (TR): Color 6 (Magenta)**\n        *   **Bottom-Left (BL): Color 4 (Yellow)**\n        *   **Bottom-Right (BR): Color 8 (Teal)**\n\n3.  **Mapping Shapes to Quadrants:** We need to determine which input shape maps to which output quadrant.\n    *   In Example 1:\n        *   Input TL (Red) -> Output TL (Color 1).\n        *   Input TR (Orange) -> Output TR (Color 5).\n        *   Input BR (Green) -> Output BL (Color 8).\n        *   Input BL (Yellow) -> Output BR (Color 9).\n    *   In Example 2:\n        *   Input TL (Magenta) -> Output TL (Color 2).\n        *   Input TR (Grey) -> Output BL (Color 8).\n        *   Input BL (Maroon) -> Output BR (Color 3).\n        *   Input BR (Blue) -> Output TR (Color 4).\n    *   Comparing the Test Input to the examples, we follow the pattern of assembling the puzzle. The shapes are tessellated to form a complete rectangle.\n    *   Based on shape sizes and dimensions in the Test Input (Maroon ~10x8, Grey ~10x12, Red ~6x4, Orange ~3x6), and assuming a **13x13** output grid (fitting the width 10+3=13 and height 8+? or 12+?), we map:\n        *   **Output TL (Color 3)** corresponds to the **Maroon (TL)** input shape.\n        *   **Output TR (Color 6)** corresponds to the **Red (BR)** input shape.\n        *   **Output BL (Color 4)** corresponds to the **Grey (TR)** input shape.\n        *   **Output BR (Color 8)** corresponds to the **Orange (BL)** input shape.\n    *   This involves moving the input shapes to their respective corners in the output grid:\n        *   Maroon (Color 9 in input) becomes **Color 3** at (0,0).\n        *   Red (Color 2 in input) becomes **Color 6** at Top-Right.\n        *   Grey (Color 5 in input) becomes **Color 4** at Bottom-Left.\n        *   Orange (Color 7 in input) becomes **Color 8** at Bottom-Right.\n\n4.  **Construction:**\n    *   The output grid size is determined to be **13x13** to accommodate the shapes.\n    *   **Layer 1 (TL, Color 3):** The Maroon shape is placed at (0,0).\n    *   **Layer 2 (TR, Color 6):** The Red shape is placed at the top-right corner.\n    *   **Layer 3 (BL, Color 4):** The Grey shape is placed at the bottom-left corner.\n    *   **Layer 4 (BR, Color 8):** The Orange shape is placed at the bottom-right corner.\n    *   Overlaps are resolved by priority (Later shapes overwrite earlier ones, or strictly tessellated). Given the tight fit, the shapes essentially tile the grid.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n\n*   **TL (Maroon -> 3):** A large block occupying the top-left.\n*   **TR (Red -> 6):** A triangle wedge in the top-right.\n*   **BL (Grey -> 4):** A large block occupying the bottom-left.\n*   **BR (Orange -> 8):** A strip in the bottom-right.\n\n**Step-by-step Grid Fill (13x13):**\n*   **Row 0:** Maroon (width 10) `3333333333` + Red (width 3, top of triangle) `666`. Total `3333333333666`.\n*   **Row 1:** Maroon (width 10) `3333333333` + Red (width 4) `6666`. Overlap at col 9? Assuming Red is Top-Right aligned, it occupies cols 9-12. Maroon occupies 0-9. `3333333336666`.\n*   ... (Continuing for all rows, handling the specific shape geometries).\n    *   Maroon shape is 10 wide, 8 high.\n    *   Red shape is 6 wide, 4 high.\n    *   Grey shape is 10 wide, 12 high.\n    *   Orange shape is 3 wide, 6 high.\n\nWait, Grey (height 12) at BL + Maroon (height 8) at TL = 20 height? This implies significant overlap or a larger grid. However, checking widths: Maroon (10) + Orange (3) = 13. Grey (10) + Red (6) = 16 (too wide).\nActually, the Grey shape maps to **TR** in Ex 2's logic? No, Grey was TR in Input, mapped to BL in Output.\nLet's stick to the visual puzzle assembly.\n*   Top Left: Maroon (3).\n*   Top Right: Red (6).\n*   Bottom Left: Grey (4).\n*   Bottom Right: Orange (8).\n\nFinal check on pixel values for row 0 of output:\nMaroon (row 0): `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3`.\nRed (row 0): `2,2,2` -> `6,6,6`.\nCombined: `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6`.\n\nCompleted Output Grid:\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, let's see. The task is to analyze these ARC problem examples and then figure out a solution. I see two examples and a test input. The goal is to produce an output grid from an input grid, based on some rules.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Hypotheses:**\n\nIt looks like the output is derived from some smaller pieces of the input grid. I'm seeing shapes and colors. My initial hypothesis is that there are 4 main regions to consider: Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, and Bottom-Right, both in the input and output. The output grid seems to be formed by combining or modifying the information in those regions, based on a key element.\n\nThe key seems to be located in the top-left section of the input, in a container of one color, and containing a small grid of *noise* of another four colors. The colors of the other three shapes and the *noise* in the container are the source of the information. The output grid looks to have those four noise colors in their respective quadrants, so I'm thinking the noise dictates the final colors.\n\n**Shape Analysis and Mapping:**\n\nI'm now looking at the shape and trying to identify if the output is just a scaled/transformed version of an input shape. Not quite! Shapes appear to be transformed, but pixel counts often don't match. Rotations are important, and it seems like the key is related to the transformations. The sizes of the output blocks are the key. If the shape is too large, the output is larger, but if it is smaller, it's also a part of the output.\n\nIn the first example, the color of the output is determined by the \"noise\", and the color arrangement is determined by position in the output: The colors are arranged similarly in quadrants, following the arrangement of the \"noise\" inside the key. This is a very interesting concept.\n\nSo I'm thinking, in each quadrant, the input region determines the shape of that region in the output. But the color of that region is determined by the \"noise\", specifically from the small grid within the frame. The rotation, resizing, and layering of the pieces are crucial. And it looks like the 9 is also a color from a corner.\n\n**Identifying the Transformation Logic:**\n\nWhat does the mapping/transformation look like? Maybe a 90-degree clockwise rotation, since the shapes seem to be arranged in quadrants? Okay, so all the shapes should be rotated 90 deg clockwise. The pixel counts help me narrow it down. The small triangle shape seems to be unchanged. In Example 2, something similar happens. One shape does a 180 and swaps.\n\nAfter closer look, it's a mix of a rotation and a swap. In Example 2, some shapes are rotated by 180 degrees and swapped. In Example 1, something similar happened, a swap by swapping positions in the output. The shapes don't rotate to match, but rather the color of the shape matches.\n\n**Test Input Approach:**\n\nSo for the test input, I will:\n\n1.  Isolate the 4 shapes\n2.  Extract the Key (noise pixels) and their position.\n3.  Perform rotations, and apply these.\n4.  Fit the rotated (or un-rotated) shapes into the correct quadrants.\n\nThe key has a frame like structure. If it follows the Ex 1 logic, one quadrant is kept unchanged, with others rotated. Let's start building up the grid now. It looks like the S_TL (the Key shape in the upper left corner) is defining my new output size. I think that's it. Let's do this!\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the test input grid based on the rules inferred from two examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid always contains four distinct clusters of colored pixels (shapes) located roughly in the four quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n2.  **The Key:** One of the shapes (always the Top-Left one in the examples and test input) acts as a \"container\" for a 2x2 key. This key consists of four pixels of different colors near the center of the container shape.\n    *   The 2x2 key layout corresponds to the four quadrants of the output grid.\n    *   Key(0,0) -> Color for Output Top-Left.\n    *   Key(0,1) -> Color for Output Top-Right.\n    *   Key(1,0) -> Color for Output Bottom-Left.\n    *   Key(1,1) -> Color for Output Bottom-Right.\n3.  **Mapping Rules:**\n    *   **Colors:** The output quadrants take the colors specified by the key.\n    *   **Shapes:** The shapes from the input quadrants are mapped to the output quadrants.\n        *   **Top-Left (TL):** The input TL shape is mapped to the output TL quadrant. It is **not rotated**.\n        *   **Top-Right (TR):** The input TR shape is mapped to the output TR quadrant. It is **rotated 90 degrees clockwise**.\n        *   **Bottom-Left (BL) and Bottom-Right (BR):** These two swap positions.\n            *   The input **Bottom-Right** shape is mapped to the output **Bottom-Left** quadrant. It is **rotated 90 degrees clockwise**.\n            *   The input **Bottom-Left** shape is mapped to the output **Bottom-Right** quadrant. It is **rotated 90 degrees clockwise**.\n4.  **Grid Construction:** The output grid is assembled by placing these transformed shapes into their respective corners. The total width is the sum of the widths of the left and right components. The total height is the sum of the heights of the top and bottom components.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key and Colors:**\n    *   The TL container (Color 9) has the key:\n        ```\n        3 6\n        4 8\n        ```\n    *   **Output TL Color:** 3\n    *   **Output TR Color:** 6\n    *   **Output BL Color:** 4\n    *   **Output BR Color:** 8\n\n2.  **Extract and Measure Input Shapes:**\n    *   **S_TL (Top-Left, Color 9):**\n        *   Shape includes the frame of 9s.\n        *   Dimensions: 10 pixels wide x 8 pixels high.\n    *   **S_TR (Top-Right, Color 5):**\n        *   Dimensions: 10 pixels wide x 12 pixels high.\n    *   **S_BL (Bottom-Left, Color 7):**\n        *   Dimensions: 3 pixels wide x 6 pixels high.\n    *   **S_BR (Bottom-Right, Color 2):**\n        *   Dimensions: 6 pixels wide x 4 pixels high.\n\n3.  **Transform Shapes:**\n    *   **T_TL (Output TL):** Source S_TL (9). **No Rotation**. Color becomes 3.\n        *   Size: 10x8.\n    *   **T_TR (Output TR):** Source S_TR (5). **Rotate 90 CW**.
