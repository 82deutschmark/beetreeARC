        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Problem Breakdown and Core Pattern Identification**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I have to figure out a pattern given three examples. It's a grid-based problem, and the goal seems to be to transform a cross shape into a more complex pattern, a spiral. Initially, I'm trying to wrap my head around the core concepts and patterns.\n\nI notice the examples consistently involve an input cross composed of 8s, centered within a grid. My first hunch is that there's a relationship between the cross's size, its center, and the output pattern. I need to figure out what that rule is. The basic idea is that the output looks like a spiral or labyrinth shape where 8s represent walls, and 0s are openings/pathways.\n\n**Analysis of Example 1: Defining Center and Basic Spiral**\n\nLet's dissect Example 1. It's a 12x12 grid with a \"+\" shape in the middle, formed by 8s, centered at coordinates (4, 5). The output looks like concentric square rings or a spiral emanating from the center. I'm trying to see if there's a simple, predictable rule at play.\n\nObserving the immediate neighbors, the center is a 0, with 8s all around, which suggests a basic square with gaps. I'm focusing on the distance from the center and the structure of these rings to understand the logic. Tracing 8s, I can see a distinct spiral that winds outwards from the cross, maybe it's just a set of square rings with gaps? The walls are one pixel thick and separated by one pixel of open space.\n\n**Analyzing Example 2 and 3: Scale and Shape**\n\nI move on to Example 2. It's a larger 22x22 grid, but the core idea is similar. The cross has a bigger radius, so the pattern expands.  The central + shape defines the heart of the resulting spiral. The radius of the arm is what defines this scaling.\n\nIn Example 3, another larger but finite grid, it's a 16x16 grid, again, a \"+\" shape.\n\nThe examples tell me that there's a consistent spiral shape, and the center is crucial. The size is related to how big the spiral is. In Example 1, radius is 1, in Example 2 is 3, Example 3 is 2. The size is important.\n\n**Identifying Core Logic: Walls, Corridors and \"Maze\"**\n\nThe output is like a maze! It looks like there are walls and corridors. I need to understand where the walls are and where the gaps are.\n\nI notice that the 0s and 8s create a sort of checkerboard pattern. The 8s seem to define \"walls\" where the 0s represent paths. The spiral itself is formed by these walls, with the gaps in them allowing passage from one ring to the next.\n\n**Defining the Radius, Ring, Walls, Gaps and Bridges**\n\nI can see a more generalized picture now:\n* I can assign a distance, or a radius $k$, from the center to any cell of the grid.\n* The grid is made up of concentric square rings defined by $k$.\n* Even rings become \"walls\" made up of 8s.\n* Odd rings form \"corridors\" that are filled with 0.\n* I need a logical pattern for gaps in the walls.\n* There are \"bridges\" that are 8s that block the path, and a clear rule must govern where to put these bridges.\n\n**Formalizing Gaps, Rotation and the Inner Core**\n\nI realize that walls have specific gaps that let the path go through. I start to note how the gap positions move along from the center to figure this out.\n\nI find that the positions of these \"gaps\" follow a consistent rotational pattern, like rotated versions of each other.\n\nThe inner structure also has a consistent pattern.  I define a \"core\" region at $k \\le S$, which gets filled depending on whether $S$ (arm length) is odd or even, and which also sets the start of the spiral. The core is an integral part of the generation, since the gaps can start there.\n\n**Refining the Algorithm and Addressing the Test Input**\n\nFor the core shape (inner $k \\le S$), I observe that it's a filled cross (if S is odd) or a solid square (if S is even). The solid square approach holds.\n\nI decide to create an explicit algorithm.\nFor the Test input I now need to start from a 0-filled grid and go through several steps.\n1. Define the center.\n2. Build the Core: Fill with 8 within a specified distance from center.\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows a pattern of generating concentric square \"walls\" and \"corridors\" centered on the shape from the input.\n\n**Logic:**\n\n1.  **Identify Center and Size:**\n    *   Find the bounding box of the cross shape in the input.\n    *   The center $(r_c, c_c)$ is the geometric center of the cross.\n    *   The size $S$ (radius) is the distance from the center to the tip of the cross arms.\n    *   For the test input: The cross spans rows 8-16 and cols 6-14. The center is $(12, 10)$. The width is 9, so radius $S = 4$.\n\n2.  **Generate Core ($k \\le S$):**\n    *   The center pixel $(r_c, c_c)$ is always 0.\n    *   The structure of the inner rings depends on the parity of $S$.\n    *   For even $S$ (like $S=4$ in the test case), the area from radius 1 up to $S-1$ (i.e., rings 1, 2, 3) is filled solidly with 8s.\n    *   Ring $S$ (Ring 4) acts as the first \"Wall\".\n\n3.  **Generate Walls (Even Rings $k \\ge S$):**\n    *   Rings at distances $k = 4, 6, 8, 10, \\dots$ are \"Walls\".\n    *   Initialize the ring with 8s.\n    *   Create \"Gaps\" (set to 0) at specific positions to allow spiral passage.\n    *   The gap on the Top edge (North) of ring $k$ is at relative coordinate $(-k, -(k-1))$.\n    *   Gaps on other edges are rotated 90 degrees:\n        *   Right (East): $(- (k-1), k)$\n        *   Bottom (South): $(k, k-1)$\n        *   Left (West): $(k-1, -k)$\n\n4.  **Generate Corridors and Bridges (Odd Rings $k > S$):**\n    *   Rings at distances $k = 5, 7, 9, \\dots$ are \"Corridors\" (mostly 0s).\n    *   \"Bridges\" (single 8s) are placed to block the corridor at specific axes, alternating pattern.\n    *   Since $S=4$ (even), the pattern starts with East/South bridges for the first corridor ($k=5$), then North/West for the next ($k=7$), and alternates.\n        *   Pattern A (E, S): Bridges at relative $(0, k)$ and $(k, 0)$.\n        *   Pattern B (N, W): Bridges at relative $(-k, 0)$ and $(0, -k)$.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Center:** (12, 10)\n*   **Core:** Rings 1, 2, 3 are filled with 8. Center (12, 10) is 0.\n*   **Wall 4:** Ring 4 filled with 8. Gaps at relative $(-4, -3), (-3, 4), (4, 3), (3, -4)$.\n*   **Corridor 5:** Bridges at E $(12, 15)$ and S $(17, 10)$.\n*   **Wall 6:** Ring 6 filled with 8. Gaps at relative $(-6, -5), (-5, 6), (6, 5), (5, -6)$.\n*   **Corridor 7:** Bridges at N $(5, 10)$ and W $(12, 3)$.\n*   **Wall 8:** Ring 8 filled with 8.

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Input Pattern**: Each example has a cross shape made of 8s with a 0 at the center. The cross has arms extending in four directions.\n\n2. **Output Pattern**: The transformation creates a rectangular spiral pattern emanating from the cross, with alternating regions of 8s and 0s forming nested rectangles.\n\n**Analysis of the test input:**\n- Cross center: row 12, column 10 (where the 0 is surrounded by 8s)\n- Arm length: 4 cells in each direction (vertical: rows 8-11 and 13-16; horizontal: cols 6-9 and 11-14)\n- Grid size: 26\u00d726\n\n**Transformation rules identified:**\n1. The cross pattern is preserved\n2. On the axes (row 12 and col 10), beyond the arm, values alternate starting with 0 at distance arm_length+1\n3. The rest of the grid forms a rectangular spiral pattern with nested rectangles of 8s and 0s\n4. The spiral winds outward from the center with each \"ring\" alternating between 8 and 0 regions\n\nApplying these patterns to construct the output:\n\n```\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Final Solution and Reasoning for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. The user wants me to solve this Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.  I'm presented with input-output pairs that I need to analyze. My goal is to figure out the transformation rule that the system is using. Once I've cracked the code, I'll apply it to the new test input.\n\nFirst, I analyze the input and output grids and look for relationships. I start with simple examples to see if I can find patterns. I quickly realize that many of the patterns involve a \"cross\" shape (maybe diagonal, maybe rectilinear) that appears in the input grid. This becomes a cornerstone of my analysis.\n\nThe tricky part is that the output often involves expanding or shrinking versions of this shape. The challenge is figuring out precisely *how* it's modified.  Are we expanding with a consistent pattern? Is it about nested \"shells\" around the center? or is it a \"grid\" that is transformed by the central shape.\nI test different hypotheses: distance from the center, checkerboard patterns, modulo arithmetics. But no luck.\n\nSo I look at the behavior of the output pixels. I have observed that \"solid\" lines appear. Also the \"Gap\" idea. Based on observing all the provided examples, I can infer that there are likely two main factors:\n1.  A base pattern, like a checkerboard, that fills the image\n2.  The central cross modifies it.\n\nHere is the approach I settled on:\n*   **The Baseline: Checkerboard with center set to 8.**\n    First, I create a pattern by filling a grid with alternating 8s and 0s \u2013 a basic checkerboard. The center pixel is always 8 (this accounts for parity differences).\n*   **Modified Cross: The Cross shape defines a gap that grows with distance.** The cross structure creates \"gaps\" or modifies the checkerboard. I focus on the gaps between these central shapes.\n    The gaps extend out from the cross shape in rows and columns: The distance ($d$) from the center influences the width of the gap.\n    The gap starts at distance $L$ and has 1 pixel wide, after this, its width grows linearly with the distance from the center.\n\nBased on this logic, I develop a final formula. I'm ready to apply this to the test case!\n\n\nThe transformation rule inferred from the examples is based on the size of the cross in the input.\n1.  **Identify the Cross:**\n    *   Find the center $(r_c, c_c)$ of the cross shape formed by the 8s.\n    *   Determine the arm length $L$.\n        *   Example 1: $L=1$.\n        *   Example 2: $L=3$.\n        *   Example 3: $L=2$.\n        *   Test Input: The cross is centered at $(12, 10)$ with arm length $L=4$.\n\n2.  **Generate the Pattern:**\n    *   **Base Layer:** Create a checkerboard pattern of 8s and 0s centered at $(r_c, c_c)$.\n        *   Set pixel $(r, c)$ to 8 if the Manhattan distance $|r - r_c| + |c - c_c|$ is even (or equivalently if $r+c$ has the same parity as $r_c+c_c$).\n        *   Otherwise, set it to 0.\n    *   **Inner Cross (Arms):** For pixels within distance $L$ along the axes (i.e., $|r - r_c| < L$ with $c=c_c$, or $|c - c_c| < L$ with $r=r_c$), force the value to 8. This ensures the \"arms\" of the cross are solid 8s, overriding the checkerboard zeros.\n    *   **Outer Gaps (Star/Mask):** Apply a mask of 0s that starts at the tips of the cross ($d=L$) and expands outwards.\n        *   Along the vertical axis ($c=c_c$), for any row $r$ such that $d_r = |r - r_c| \\ge L$:\n            *   Set pixels to 0 if their horizontal distance $d_c = |c - c_c|$ satisfies $d_c \\le (d_r - L)$.\n            *   This creates a triangular/wedge gap of 0s widening away from the center.\n        *   Along the horizontal axis ($r=r_c$), for any column $c$ such that $d_c = |c - c_c| \\ge L$:\n            *   Set pixels to 0 if their vertical distance $d_r = |r - r_c|$ satisfies $d_r \\le (d_c - L)$.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Size:** 26x26.\n*   **Center:** $(12, 10)$.\n*   **Arm Length:** $L=4$.\n\n**Logic applied to each pixel $(r, c)$:**\n1.  Calculate $dr = |r - 12|$ and $dc = |c - 10|$.\n2.  **Base:** $val = 8$ if $(dr + dc)$ is even, else $0$.\n3.  **Inner Cross:** If ($dr=0$ and $dc < 4$) or ($dc=0$ and $dr < 4$), $val = 8$.\n4.  **Outer Gaps:**\n    *   If $dr \\ge 4$ and $dc \\le (dr - 4)$, $val = 0$.\n    *   If $dc \\ge 4$ and $dr \\le (dc - 4)$, $val = 0$.\n\noutput:\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0\n0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0\n0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the examples)\n\nAcross the solved examples, the few `8` pixels in the input are not the full drawing; they are **clues** that sit on top of a much larger, deterministic \u201clabyrinth/spiral-wall\u201d structure made only of `0` and `8`. The output is that full structure.\n\nA consistent way to reconstruct the full structure is:\n\n1. **Start with an all\u20110 grid** the same size as the input.\n2. **Draw a single continuous square spiral of color `8`** along the border, then one layer inward, etc.  \n   To match the \u201cmaze corridor\u201d look (walls separated by a 1\u2011cell gap), after completing one rectangular loop we move **inward by 2 cells** (not 1).\n3. The spiral is produced ring-by-ring with boundaries  \n   `top, left, bottom, right`:\n   - Paint the **top edge** from `(top,left)` to `(top,right)`\n   - Paint the **right edge** from `(top+1,right)` to `(bottom,right)`\n   - Paint the **bottom edge** from `(bottom,right-1)` to `(bottom,left)`\n   - Paint the **left edge** from `(bottom-1,left)` up to `(top+2,left)`  \n     (stopping early creates the spiral \u201centrance\u201d into the next inner ring)\n   - Then update: `top += 2, left += 2, bottom -= 2, right -= 2`\n4. **Overlay the input clues**: any cell that is `8` in the input must be `8` in the output, and the central \u201cgap\u201d cell in the clue-cross stays `0`.\n\nApplying that to the test input (26\u00d726) yields the following output.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8  \n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8  \n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8  \n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8  \n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",
