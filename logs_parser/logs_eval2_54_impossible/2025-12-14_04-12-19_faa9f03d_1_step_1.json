        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing and Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this ARC task, and it seems I need to figure out a pattern from these examples. My brain's whirring already. Let's break this down. It looks like there are horizontal and vertical lines of different colors, possibly with gaps or being interrupted.\n\n**Initial Observations and Hypotheses:**\n\nMy initial thought is that there are \"lines\" defined by color and endpoints. These endpoints might be marked by a different color or something. I see \"terminators,\" kind of like end caps on these lines. These might be a different color, often red, like in Example 1. It looks like where these lines cross, sometimes one color \"wins\" - maybe because of the terminator color? Maybe it's a priority system, with a line overwriting others? My first thought is that there is a defined priority based on the line color value and the horizontal or vertical nature of the line.\n\n**Drilling Down with the Examples:**\n\nExample 1 is key here. It has a horizontal line interrupted by a vertical line, and I need to figure out how it changes. It seems horizontal lines are represented by sequences of pixels of same color with or without an interrupting pixel of different color. It really comes down to what happens at the \"intersections,\" especially with other lines and those terminator pixels. I started to notice that when an horizontal line (like green \"3\") comes across a vertical line (like blue \"1\"), the output becomes the blue line at that intersection. It seems like the line with the lower numerical value \"wins\" (or is stronger) here.\n\nExample 2 is a bit more puzzling. Here, instead of being bounded on both sides, the line is defined by one marker/terminator (the number 4), and it seems to \"fill\" or extend to the right edge. It seems like the 4 might indicate a directional extension to fill the pixels with the color to its right? I realized I needed to carefully check the color assignments, so that I can determine a color priority.\n\nExample 3: Here there seems to be more color interactions. I see vertical lines interrupted by horizontal ones, and it gets complicated.  It seems that  the red `2` might be a *universal* terminator. I realize that color could have the concept of line precedence, maybe something like a horizontal `6` can overwrite a vertical `1`.\n\nExample 4 had me thinking about how the lines are really formed (Is it continuous segments or are there gaps? Is there movement of things?).  I'm getting that maybe these \"4\" markers might mean \"shift this line\" or \"copy this bit and put it over here\". I'm seeing more and more of these key pixels that trigger some kind of movement.\n\n**Refining the Hypothesis:**\n\nI'm thinking I need to find the rule for how these lines are defined, what the markers do, and how overlaps are resolved. Maybe my model should have the following:\n\n1.  I have to find \"lines\". This could mean scanning all the different color pixels that compose it.  It seems to be all pixels of a given color, connected on the same row or column.\n2.  I think those markers (like the `2`s and `4`s) have a special role. Maybe they mean \"Here starts a line,\" or \"Fill this space with the line's color\" in a certain direction?\n3.  I think the *intersections* are the crucial part. There's a rule there - like the lower numerical color \"wins\" or gets displayed at that pixel.\n\n**A More Detailed Approach:**\n\nHere, I'm thinking:\n*  \"Line\" really seems to be a set of contiguous pixels of the same color.\n*  The lines are defined by either\n    *  \"Terminators\":  Pixels with a different color at each end (Ex 1, 3).\n    *  A marker that causes an action: Like the `4` in Ex 2.\n    *  Edges of the grid\n*  If there's no intersection, I fill the space between the end pixels (or the grid edge). The endpoints become the line color.\n*  If there's an intersection, the lower-valued color \"wins\" or overwrites. This rule seems to apply whether the intersection is horizontal-vertical or horizontal-horizontal.\n*   The `4` is definitely a key. I am getting that it is a *directional line-building tool*.  It says: \"Start a line here, and go outwards in a specific direction with this color.\"  In Ex 2, it seems to be going to the right. In Ex 4, it goes downwards. I need to know why.\n\nI have to carefully evaluate the effect of that `4`. Does it\n\nThe problem asks us to identify lines and fill them based on markers and their intersections. Based on the solved examples, here are the rules derived:\n\n1.  **Line Definition**:\n    *   **Bounded Lines**: A pair of `2`s (red) in the same row or column with pixels of a specific color `C` between them defines a line segment of color `C`. The `2`s serve as terminators and are replaced by color `C`. (Seen in Ex 1, Ex 3).\n    *   **Edge-Based Lines**: Lines of a color extending to the grid edge (without `2`s) are valid and fill their extent (including gaps, if implied). (Seen in Ex 1, Ex 4).\n    *   **Source-Created Lines (`4`)**: A pixel `4` (yellow) acts as a source/modifier. It looks for an adjacent pixel that is part of a valid line (or a terminator `2`). It then creates a new line of that color starting from itself and extending to the grid edge in the direction *opposite* to the neighbor. The `4` is replaced by the line color. (Seen in Ex 2, Ex 4).\n\n2.  **Intersection Priority**:\n    When two lines cross, the color at the intersection is determined by a hierarchy of line strength:\n    *   **Source-Created (`4`) > Edge-Based**: A line created by a `4` overwrites an Edge-Based line. (In Ex 2, `4`-created horizontal green beat Edge-based vertical orange).\n    *   **Edge-Based > Bounded (`2`)**: An Edge-Based line overwrites a Bounded line. (In Ex 3, Edge-based horizontal magenta beat Bounded vertical blue).\n    *   **Unbounded vs Unbounded**: If both are Edge-Based, the one with the *lower* color value wins. (In Ex 4, Blue `1` beat Magenta `6`).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Lines:**\n    *   **Vertical Col 4**: `7`s from row 0 to `2` at row 3. Edge-Based (Top) to Bounded (Bottom). Fills (0,4) to (3,4) with 7.\n    *   **Vertical Col 10**: `7`s from row 0 to `2` at row 3. Edge-Based to Bounded. Fills (0,10) to (3,10) with 7.\n    *   **Vertical Col 1**: `2` at (3,1) to `2` at (9,1). Bounded by `2`s. Fills (3,1) to (9,1) with 7.\n    *   **Vertical Col 7**: `2` at (3,7) to `2` at (9,7). Bounded by `2`s. Fills (3,7) to (9,7) with 7.\n    *   **Horizontal Row 3**: Two segments bounded by `2`s.\n        *   (3,1) to (3,4): Fills with 7.\n        *   (3,7) to (3,10): Fills with 7.\n    *   **Horizontal Row 9**: `2` at (9,1) to `2` at (9,7). Bounded by `2`s. Fills (9,1) to (9,7) with 7.\n    *   **Horizontal Row 7**: Line of `6`s extending edge-to-edge (implied by `6`s at ends). Edge-Based. Fills row 7 with 6.\n\n2.  **Process `4` Extensions:**\n    *   **`4` at (3,0)**: Neighbor is `2` at (3,1) (Right). `2` is part of the 7-line. Direction is Left. Fills (3,0) with 7.\n    *   **`4` at (4,10)**: Neighbor is `2` at (3,10) (Up). `2` is part of the 7-line. Direction is Down. Fills (4,10) to (11,10) with 7.\n\n3.  **Resolve Intersections:**\n    *   **(7,1)**: Intersection of Horizontal Row 7 (`6`, Edge-Based) and Vertical Col 1 (`7`, Bounded). Edge-Based > Bounded. **Result: 6**.\n    *   **(7,7)**: Intersection of Horizontal Row 7 (`6`, Edge-Based) and Vertical Col 7 (`7`, Bounded). Edge-Based > Bounded. **Result: 6**.\n    *   **(7,10)**: Intersection of Horizontal Row 7 (`6`, Edge-Based) and Vertical Col 10 (`7`, Source-Created from `4`). Source-Created > Edge-Based. **Result: 7**.\n\n4.  **Construct Final Grid:**\n    *   **Row 0-2**: Cols 4, 10 are 7.\n    *   **Row 3**: 7s at 0-4 and 7-10.\n    *   **Row 4-6**: 7s at Cols 1, 7, 10.\n    *   **Row 7**: 6s across the row, *except* Col 10 is 7. (Cols 1 and 7 remain 6 due to priority).\n    *   **Row 8**: 7s at Cols 1, 7, 10.\n    *   **Row 9**: 7s at Cols 1-7 and Col 10.\n    *   **Row 10-11**: 7 at Col 10.\n\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,7,7,7,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Final Reconstruction Strategy for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack this ARC puzzle.  It looks like the goal is to \"complete\" lines on a grid based on some initial, sparse examples. After going through the examples, here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Line Identification:** I need to find the lines (horizontal and vertical) on the grid.  A line is characterized by its color, and it appears as a segment of pixels with the same color. However, some lines have markers. Those markers come in two key colors: `2` and `4`. The body itself must be a different color.\n2.  **Marker Roles:**\n    *   **Marker `2`:** This indicates a standard endpoint of a line.  Any part of the input \"between\" markers, or between a marker and an edge is automatically part of the line. Also, since there are usually two of them, segments that are next to one another are parts of the same, complete line.\n    *   **Marker `4`:** This is used to extend a line to an edge.  When it is at the end of a line, then the line will be extended as far as possible in the direction that it suggests.\n3.  **Color Overwrites:** When lines intersect, they overwrite each other's colors. The priority order is: Horizontal lines beat Vertical lines\n4.  **Final Grid Construction:** I need to start with an empty black grid. I go through each horizontal and vertical segment and:\n    *   If it's defined by markers, I fill everything in between with the line's color.\n    *   If there is a marker at the edge of something, I fill any empty part of the grid with its line's color until another edge is hit.\n    *   Where lines intersect, I use the overwrite priority. The order is:\n        1.  `6`\n        2.  `7`\n\n    *   Any individual pixels not part of a line (not between markers or connecting to an edge) are just removed. These should not affect my output grid.\n\nLet's see if this works!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct the output grid based on the provided test input and the logic inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Inferred Logic:**\n1.  **Lines and Segments:** The grid contains line segments defined by \"body\" pixels and \"marker\" pixels (endpoints).\n    *   **Body:** A sequence of pixels of a specific color (e.g., `3`, `7`, `6`, `1`).\n    *   **Markers:** Pixels of a different color (specifically `2` and `4` in the examples) that mark the ends or junctions of lines.\n    *   **Rule:** The markers are replaced by the body color of the line they are attached to. Gaps between markers on the same line (if aligned and part of the structure) are filled with the body color.\n\n2.  **Extensions:**\n    *   **Marker `2`:** Acts as a standard endpoint. The line stops at `2` (inclusive).\n    *   **Marker `4`:** Acts as an \"extension\" marker. It indicates that the line continues from the anchor point (the adjacent part of the line) past the marker to the edge of the grid in that direction.\n\n3.  **Noise Removal:** Pixels that are not part of a defined line segment (i.e., not connected to markers or other lines) are treated as noise and removed (turned to `0`). In the examples, lines are always explicitly defined by markers or by crossing the entire grid. In the test input, valid segments are bounded by `2`s or `4`s.\n\n4.  **Priority/Intersections:** When lines of different colors intersect:\n    *   Example 1 showed `1` (blue) overwriting `3` (green).\n    *   Example 2 showed `3` (green) overwriting `7` (orange).\n    *   Example 3 showed `6` (pink) overwriting `1` (blue) and `7` (orange).\n    *   **Hierarchy:** `6` > `1` > `3` > `7`.\n    *   In the Test Input, we have a horizontal line of `6`s crossing vertical lines of `7`s. Based on the hierarchy, `6` will overwrite `7` at the intersections.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Structure Identification:**\n    *   **Horizontal Arm (Row 3):** Defined by `2`s at (3,1), (3,4), (3,7), (3,10). The segments contain `7`s. The gaps (like 4-7) are between markers of the same structure, so they are filled with `7`.\n        *   **Extension Left:** Marker `4` at (3,0) is adjacent to the arm start at (3,1). It extends the line to the left edge. So (3,0) becomes `7`.\n    *   **Spine (Column 4):** `7`s from (0,4) to (2,4), ending at marker `2` at (3,4). This is a valid segment. Filled with `7`.\n    *   **Right Extension (Column 10):**\n        *   Top part: `7`s from (0,10) to (2,10) ending at `2` at (3,10). Valid segment.\n        *   Bottom part: Marker `4` at (4,10) is adjacent to the junction at (3,10). It extends the line downwards to the edge. So (4,10) to (11,10) become `7`.\n    *   **Legs/Supports (Columns 1 and 7):**\n        *   Col 1: Starts at (4,1) (adjacent to arm), ends at `2` at (9,1). Filled with `7`.\n        *   Col 7: Starts at (4,7) (adjacent to arm), ends at `2` at (9,7). Filled with `7`.\n    *   **Base (Row 9):** Defined by markers `2` at (9,1) and (9,7). Filled with `7` between them.\n    *   **Crossbar (Row 7):** A line of `6`s running across the grid. It has no markers but is a complete line.\n\n*   **Construction Steps:**\n    1.  **Fill `7`s:**\n        *   Row 3: Fill col 0 to 10 with `7`.\n        *   Row 9: Fill col 1 to 7 with `7`.\n        *   Col 4: Fill row 0 to 3 with `7`.\n        *   Col 1: Fill row 4 to 9 with `7`.\n        *   Col 7: Fill row 4 to 9 with `7`.\n        *   Col 10: Fill row 0 to 11 with `7`.\n    2.  **Fill `6`s (Overwrite):**\n        *   Row 7: Fill col 0 to 11 with `6`. This overwrites the `7`s at (7,1), (7,7), and (7,10).\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n*   **Row 0-2:** `7` at col 4 and 10.\n*   **Row 3:** `7` at col 0-10.\n*   **Row 4-6:** `7` at col 1, 7, 10.\n*   **Row 7:** `6` at all columns (0-11).\n*   **Row 8:** `7` at col 1, 7, 10.\n*   **Row 9:** `7` at col 1-7 and 10.\n*   **Row 10-11:** `7` at col 10.\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Solving ARC Tasks with Line Repair and Weaving Logic**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a 12x12 grid and tasked with figuring out a pattern. The examples given seem to involve some kind of transformation from input to output, and I need to figure out the rules. I start by breaking down Example 1. There are lines of specific colors.\n\nInitially, I think about this as \"repairing\" broken lines.  I spot vertical and horizontal lines of the numbers 1 and 3. I see that the 'noise' pixels are somehow being filled. Looking at the diff between input and output, I notice the 2s are being transformed to 3s and 1s are extending.  I realize there is the idea of intersections and overrides: if two lines of different colors intersect, one color takes precedence. It's not clear, but the vertical 1s seem to win out over horizontal 3s.  I keep track of things that are being over written.\n\nI keep looking at examples.  Example 2 throws me off, with the input row 2 '3' disappearing. I start going through the logic again. I notice a vertical line of 7s and horizontal line of 3s, intersecting at some locations. I find that this is a case of 'overriding' again.  But it's not consistent: sometimes the horizontal wins, sometimes the vertical. This is confusing, unless there's a directionality involved. So now I think the location itself and intersection logic might be involved.  I re-examine the intersections I found earlier. There's a pattern: an over/under or weaving behavior.\n\nI start to formalize this 'weaving' concept.  Horizontal lines, vertical lines, and intersections.  I test my new weaving rule on Example 1: I find that 1s do win over 3s - no ambiguity. I then look at Example 3. There is a horizontal line and vertical line, with many intersections.  I then jump to Example 4: A more complex grid of lines of color. There are conflicts in this grid: which one overrides the other? My earlier idea of the 'index' might come into play. But it looks like I need a consistent framework for lines.\n\nI return to Example 2.  It's clear that the '3' are connected to form the line. I am reminded of the weaving pattern I had.  So, I formalize the hypothesis.  Lines are Horizontal or Vertical, they have an index. The intersections' priority is determined by the intersection point.  The intersections follow a 'checkerboard' logic. Horizontal wins at one location, Vertical at the next location. I think to myself: If the sum of the horizontal and vertical line indices is even - Vertical wins. If it is odd - Horizontal wins. I go back to Example 2 to check and it holds!\n\nBut I need to test that in a few more examples.  I test the hypothesis on Example 3. And it fails. The location of the lines are not consistent. The rule is not good enough.\n\nI start to look at what I'm missing.  The color is involved somehow. I look at the color composition of the examples and realize that lines are formed of a majority of colors in a row or column. All the colors except for zero.  Noise is different pixels.  I try a new approach.\n\nI look at the intersections again, but this time, in terms of 'noise' vs 'line'. I re-examine my thought and realize the key lies in which line's color appears at the intersection in the *input* grid.  I think, if the intersection point in the input grid matches the vertical line color, then the vertical line color takes priority. Otherwise, the horizontal line. Testing this new hypothesis across examples, it works! And yet it doesn't.\n\nNow I remember the 'Weaving' pattern. I come back to that idea. So I start testing the 'Row Alternation' weaving logic again.  Line index - if the indices of horizontal and vertical are opposite, it has to alternate.  Odd row number, or even row number? I keep testing this \"Coordinate Parity\".\n\nI am getting closer. The logic of the 'parity' or 'checkerboard' still might be a part of it. I'm wondering if a line wins an intersection, does it continue? I start testing this against all examples. I start working with line segments. A winning intersection is the seed of the line, which can \"grow\" outwards to a losing point or edge. I test this, and start seeing that 'noise' pixels can be filled with 'valid' pixels. This is the correct logic. I am just missing something: line source?\n\nI examine the Test Input, which is visually similar to Ex2.  I use the previous logic, the weave and\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rules are inferred as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Lines:** Detect horizontal and vertical lines based on the majority color of the row or column (ignoring 0s). In the Test Input:\n    *   **H1 (Row 3):** Color 2.\n    *   **H2 (Row 7):** Color 6.\n    *   **H3 (Row 9):** Color 2.\n    *   **V1 (Col 4):** Color 7.\n    *   **V2 (Col 10):** Color 7.\n\n2.  **Determine Intersections (Weaving Rule):** At each intersection of a horizontal and vertical line, one color dominates. The dominance is determined by the specific \"phase\" of the line, often alternating.\n    *   **Row 3 (H1):** Alternates V, H.\n        *   (3, 4): V wins -> **7**\n        *   (3, 10): H wins -> **2**\n    *   **Row 7 (H2):** Alternates H, V (Opposite of H1).\n        *   (7, 4): H wins -> **6**\n        *   (7, 10): V wins -> **7**\n    *   **Row 9 (H3):** Alternates V, H (Same as H1).\n        *   (9, 4): V wins -> **7**\n        *   (9, 10): H wins -> **2**\n\n3.  **Repair Segments:**\n    *   **Lines are repaired** (gaps filled) starting from the \"winning\" intersections.\n    *   **Lines are cut** (stopped) when they encounter a \"losing\" intersection.\n    *   There appears to be a **1-pixel buffer** (a 0) between a valid segment and a losing intersection, based on Example 2 (Row 9).\n\n    *   **Applying to Test Input:**\n        *   **Row 3:** Loses at 4 (becomes 7). Wins at 10 (becomes 2).\n            *   Left segment (0-4) is cut.\n            *   Right segment (5-11) is repaired with 2s. Buffer at 5 (0). Fill 6-11 with 2s.\n            *   Result: `0,0,0,0,7,0,2,2,2,2,2,2`.\n        *   **Row 7:** Wins at 4 (becomes 6). Loses at 10 (becomes 7).\n            *   Left segment (0-9) is repaired with 6s. Buffer at 9 (0). Fill 0-8 with 6s.\n            *   Right segment (10-11) is cut.\n            *   Result: `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0`.\n        *   **Row 9:** Loses at 4 (becomes 7). Wins at 10 (becomes 2).\n            *   Same pattern as Row 3.\n            *   Result: `0,0,0,0,7,0,2,2,2,2,2,2`.\n        *   **Col 4:** Wins at 3 (7), Wins at 9 (7). Loses at 7 (6).\n            *   Top segment (0-6) repaired with 7s. Buffer at 6 (0). Fill 0-5. (Note: Input starts 0s, assume lines start where data exists or edge. Ex 2 V-lines didn't fill empty space at edges if source wasn't there, but here the intersection is the source). Fill 3,4,5 with 7. 6 is 0.\n            *   Bottom segment (8-11) repaired with 7s. Buffer at 8 (0). Fill 9.\n            *   Result: `0,0,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,0`.\n        *   **Col 10:** Loses at 3 (2), Loses at 9 (2). Wins at 7 (7).\n            *   Middle segment (4-8) repaired with 7s. Buffer at 4 (0) and 8 (0).

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Thoughts & Strategy**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to figure out this ARC task. I'm presented with several solved examples and one test case. The input always includes grids with colored lines, horizontal and vertical, with varying degrees of complexity, including intersections and gaps. The output is a modified grid, and I need to deduce the transformation rules. My initial instinct is to analyze the examples systematically, noting the changes to the lines, especially at intersection points. I need to look for patterns in how colors interact and how lines are modified. The test input will be used to validate my hypothesis.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis: Decoding Line Transformations**\n\nIn Example 1, the core seems to involve \"lines,\" defined as sequences of pixels with the same color. There are horizontal and vertical lines of different colors, and intersections, too. In the output grid, lines appear to be *completed* or *extended*. For instance, the vertical \"blue\" line is extended, and its color appears to \"overwrite\" the horizontal \"green\" line at their intersection. My immediate thought is, are there dominance rules? Maybe one color \"wins\" at an intersection. Also, are endpoint colors important? The red endpoints of the horizontal green line become green in the output. This suggests that the endpoints change to match the line color.\n\n**Refining Line Definition and Intersection Dominance**\n\nI'm now thinking I need to be more precise about what constitutes a \"line.\" It's a continuous run of identical non-black pixels, possibly with caps or other color intersections. I'm focusing on two key elements: \"filling gaps\" and \"line extensions\". I also need to figure out how to handle \"cap\" colors. Are they always endpoints? Or can they indicate directions?\n\nExample 2 is interesting. Here, a yellow pixel \"intrudes\" into a green horizontal line. The line seems to shift in the output, and the Yellow pixel somehow defines the output. I also notice that the line color at intersections is not always consistent - which color \"wins\"?\n\nI hypothesize that the intersection outcomes are determined by a \"Dominance\" hierarchy.\nHypothesis:\n1.  **Identify Lines:** lines are color segments and potential gaps.\n2.  **Repair Lines:** Change endpoints/Caps to match body. Fill Gaps.\n3.  **Handle Intersections:** Apply a rule on what color over-writes what.\n\n**Introducing Cap Colors & Directions**\n\nExample 3 is now a critical test. I am checking the concept of caps and intersection rules. There, a cap or endpoint can be a solid point and the endpoint of a line segment. The yellow in this example is at the end of a moving line segment. How does a color \"4\" at the endpoint effect the rest of the line. The Yellow pixel somehow defines the output. The intersection points may be overwritten by the higher colored segment.\n\nI am starting to believe there is a link between cap colors and the direction in which lines \"extend\" or are modified. For the test input, I need to check for this behavior.\n\n**The \"Yellow Cap\" Hypothesis and Line Mobility**\n\nIn Example 4, I see vertical and horizontal lines intersecting. An important idea has emerged:  some cap colors imply *movement* or *directionality*. The yellow \"cap\" creates \"moving\" behavior, and \"red\" or a similar color may indicate static endpoints. I'm getting closer to a system. The key to ARC is usually: 1) Identify the pattern. 2) Apply the pattern.\n\n**Formulating the Dominance Hierarchy and Defining the Rules**\n\nThe evidence suggests a dominance hierarchy among the colors. It seems that \"static\" lines (those without directional caps) might be \"stronger\" than \"moving\" lines. At intersections, I need a rule for determining the \"winning\" color. I think the numerical order of the color might indicate dominance.  I'm forming a working hypothesis of Static > Moving.\n\n**Test Input - The Final Validation**\n\nFinally, I'm ready for the test input. It's time to put everything together. I need to:\n1.  Identify all the lines (static and moving).\n2.  Apply the dominance rule at intersections.\n\nBased on the earlier analysis, the rule is : 1 (Blue) > 3 (Green) > 6(Magenta) > 7 (Orange). And Static lines > Moving lines. Also, if there are multiple static lines, the dominant one will over write. If there are no static lines, moving ones will be dominant.\nI need to check how the yellow `4` cap impacts a segment.\n\nI'll proceed with this step-by-step approach. Once I have the output grid, I can check each row and column and fill in the solution. Let's start.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by identifying and completing lines defined by color segments and specific \"cap\" pixels. Based on the examples, here are the inferred rules:\n\n1.  **Line Identification**:\n    *   **Lines** are horizontal or vertical sequences of a main color (e.g., Orange 7, Green 3, Magenta 6).\n    *   **Caps** are pixels of a different color at the ends of these sequences that define the line's extent or behavior.\n        *   **Red (2)** acts as a **Static Endpoint**. A line segment is filled with the main color between two endpoints (or between a grid boundary and an endpoint).\n        *   **Yellow (4)** acts as a **Mobile Source**. It indicates the start of a line that extends in the direction away from the line's current body (e.g., if 4 is at the bottom, the line extends down; if at the right, it extends right). This implies a \"moving\" line.\n\n2.  **Line Completion**:\n    *   Gaps (0s) within the defined extent of a line are filled with the line's main color.\n    *   The Cap pixels themselves (2, 4) are replaced by the line's main color.\n\n3.  **Intersection Dominance**:\n    *   When lines cross, one color overwrites the other.\n    *   **Static vs. Moving**: Static lines (bounded by 2 or grid edges) appear to dominate Moving lines (initiated by 4).\n    *   **Color Hierarchy**: Between Static lines, there is a hierarchy. Based on examples (1 > 3 > 7 and 1 > 6), and inferring for the test case (6 vs 7), we observe that lower numbers (Blue 1, Green 3) dominate higher numbers (Orange 7). Following this pattern and visual prominence in the test grid, Magenta (6) dominates Orange (7).\n\n**Application to Test Input**:\n\n*   **Vertical Lines (Orange 7)**:\n    *   **Col 1**: Defined by Red caps (2) at Row 3 and Row 9. The line fills Rows 3-9 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Col 4**: Defined by start at Row 0 and Red cap (2) at Row 3. Fills Rows 0-3 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Col 7**: Defined by Red caps (2) at Row 3 and Row 9. Fills Rows 3-9 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Col 10 (Top)**: Defined by start at Row 0 and Red cap (2) at Row 3. Fills Rows 0-3 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Col 10 (Bottom)**: Defined by Yellow cap (4) at Row 4. This indicates a moving line extending downwards. Fills Rows 4-11 with Orange (7).\n\n*   **Horizontal Lines (Orange 7)**:\n    *   **Row 3 (Left)**: Defined by Yellow cap (4) at Col 0 and Red cap (2) at Col 4. It fills Cols 0-4 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Row 3 (Right)**: Defined by Red caps (2) at Col 7 and Col 10. Fills Cols 7-10 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Row 9**: Defined by Red caps (2) at Col 1 and Col 7. Fills Cols 1-7 with Orange (7).\n\n*   **Horizontal Line (Magenta 6)**:\n    *   **Row 7**: A complete static line of Magenta (6) spanning Cols 0-11.\n\n*   **Resolving Intersections**:\n    *   **Row 7**: The Magenta (6) line crosses the Vertical Orange (7) lines at Cols 1, 7, and 10.

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Markers 2 and 4** indicate special positions where lines need to be extended or connected\n2. **Marker 2** typically marks corners where two same-colored lines meet at 90 degrees, or endpoints of line segments\n3. **Marker 4** indicates where a line should extend in one direction (usually away from existing cells of that color)\n4. When filling lines, the markers (2 or 4) get replaced with the line's color\n5. Gaps in lines are filled to complete them\n6. At intersections, perpendicular lines can override horizontal segments\n\nAnalyzing the test input:\n- **Row 3** has horizontal 7-line segments with markers at positions 0-4 and 7-10\n- **Row 9** has a horizontal 7-line segment from columns 1-7 with markers at ends\n- **Column 1, 7**: Vertical 7-lines from row 3 to row 9 (markers at both ends)\n- **Column 4**: Vertical 7-line from row 0-3 (marker at row 3)\n- **Column 10**: Vertical 7-line with marker 2 at row 3 and marker 4 at row 4, extending down\n- **Row 7**: Horizontal 6-line (no markers, just fills gap at column 7)\n\nApplying the transformation:\n- Replace all markers (2, 4) with the line color (7)\n- Fill gaps in vertical lines at columns 1, 7 (rows 3-9) and column 10 (extending to row 11)\n- At row 7, vertical 7-lines override the horizontal 6-line at columns 1, 7, and 10\n- Fill the gap at column 7 row 7 with 7 (from vertical line)\n\n```json\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,7,7,7,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n6,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,7,6\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Lines and Markers**: The grids contain lines of a single color (like 7s, 6s, 1s, 3s). Numbers 2 and 4 act as markers indicating endpoints or extension points for these lines.\n\n2. **Filling Gaps**: Lines fill in gaps to become continuous. Markers (2 and 4) get replaced by the line's color.\n\n3. **Crossing Priority**: When two lines cross:\n   - If one line has a \"gap\" at the intersection (needs to be filled) and the other doesn't, the line with the gap wins\n   - When both have gaps, vertical lines take priority over horizontal lines\n\nAnalyzing the test input:\n- **Column 1**: Vertical 7 line from rows 3-9 (markers at rows 3 and 9)\n- **Column 4**: Vertical 7 line from rows 0-3 (marker at row 3)\n- **Column 7**: Vertical 7 line from rows 3-9 (markers at rows 3 and 9)\n- **Column 10**: Vertical 7 line from rows 0-4 (markers at rows 3 and 4)\n- **Row 3**: Two horizontal 7 segments with markers - extends from positions 0-4 and 7-10\n- **Row 7**: Horizontal 6 line with gap at position 7\n- **Row 9**: Horizontal 7 line with markers at positions 1 and 7\n\nAt intersections (7,1) and (7,7): The vertical 7 lines have gaps (need to extend through row 7), so they override the horizontal 6 line at these positions.\n\nThe output grid:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,7,7,7,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n6,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,6\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Lines and markers**: Each example has horizontal and vertical lines of a consistent color (like 1s, 3s, 6s, 7s) with \"markers\" (2s or 4s) indicating line boundaries/corners.\n\n2. **Line completion**: Lines with gaps are filled in between markers. The markers (2s) get replaced by the line's color.\n\n3. **4 markers (pivots)**: A \"4\" indicates where a vertical line should \"pivot\" - the portion of the line on one side of the pivot is removed, and it extends in the opposite direction.\n\n4. **Intersection handling**: When lines cross, the line that has a \"gap\" at that cell fills it with its color. If both have gaps, the vertical line takes precedence.\n\nFor the test input:\n- **Column 4**: Vertical 7-line from rows 0-3 (marker at row 3 becomes 7)\n- **Column 1**: Vertical 7-line from rows 3-9 (markers become 7, gap at row 7 filled with 7)\n- **Column 7**: Vertical 7-line from rows 3-9 (markers become 7, gap at row 7 filled with 7)\n- **Column 10**: The \"4\" at (4,10) indicates the line pivots - 7s at rows 0-2 are removed, and line extends down from row 3 to row 11\n- **Row 3**: Horizontal 7-line from columns 0-4 and 7-10 (all markers including the 4 become 7)\n- **Row 7**: Horizontal 6-line fills gap at column 7, but vertical 7-lines override at columns 1, 7, and 10\n- **Row 9**: Horizontal 7-line from columns 1-7 (markers become 7)\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,7,7,7,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n6,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,7,6\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n```",
