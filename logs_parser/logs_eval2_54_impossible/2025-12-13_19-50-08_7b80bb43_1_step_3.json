        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment: Understanding the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to figure out a visual pattern and apply it. Seems straightforward. I'm given examples, and I need to deduce the transformation rules to apply to the test input. My first thought is to break down the example, understand the original \"scene\", and see how it's altered. The main focus is on the changes in color and shapes. Looks like it's a wireframe or grid-based system where some lines are incomplete or broken.\n\n**Example 1: Line Analysis and Transformation**\n\nExample 1 is a good starting point. I can clearly see some vertical lines and horizontal lines in both input and output. The background color stays the same. The real action is in the magenta pattern. I'm focusing on \"strokes\" or segments of this magenta color. I need to note where they're located, any gaps or breaks, and how that changes in the output. Immediately, I start noticing that some gaps in the lines are getting filled. For instance, Row 7 is a good test case; there are gaps in the input, and then they disappear in the output. The pixels seem to connect to neighboring strokes to complete a line. The main process appears to be line completion and fixing deviations.\n\n**Connectivity, Gaps, and Deviations**\n\nI'm paying attention to how these lines \"connect\". Is a gap filled if a horizontal line touches a vertical line? I'm trying to see the conditions to fill gaps. I'm starting to think about connectivity as a key factor. Not all gaps are filled, so I need to know why. In particular, the gaps in Row 7 are very insightful to track which are filled and which are not. I have a hypothesis that it depends on the \"connectivity\" with surrounding line segments. A long, broken line will be restored. A deviation (a pixel just next to a line) will also likely be snapped to the line and \"fixed\". Now, gaps seem to be filled if they are smaller than, or equal to, 3 pixels.\n\n**Example 2: Refining the Rules and Adding Complexity**\n\nExample 2 is really critical. It has a different background color and pattern, but the logic should be consistent. The primary idea is the same - complete lines and remove noise. I need to make sure the conclusions I got from Ex 1 apply to Ex 2. I have a vertical line that seems to extend through a series of \"gaps\" or breaks. In Ex 2, a line's deviations are \"snapped\" to the line. And there's some noise pixels that don't fit the pattern. It also reinforces the idea of fixing broken lines. This is a crucial observation.\n\n**Developing a Solid Strategy**\n\nBased on this, I'm forming a clearer strategy. I need to find the core elements. (1) Identify potential horizontal and vertical lines. (2) \"Snap\" any deviations from this horizontal-vertical grid. (3) Fill short gaps if they exist. (4) Remove pixels that are far away from a valid line (Noise). The idea is to build a sort of wireframe.\n\n**Applying the Rules to Example 1: Gap Behavior**\n\nI'm going back to Ex 1 and applying the above rule. There are certain things that I need to clarify. I still don't fully get why one gap is filled and not the other. This gap has the same length, with both endpoints being connected to a vertical line, why is it filled or not filled? Here is where a pattern recognition comes into play. I need to see more features to find an underlying theory. I revisit Ex 1 and find a slight discrepancy. I had missed a feature. I re-read the description carefully and get more precise. I refine the strategy.\n\n**Unraveling the Test Input**\n\nNow I have to look at the test input. It's a new example, and I need to apply my rules to transform it. I need to find the core horizontal and vertical lines again and note what are the deviations to snap them or what are the gaps to fill them. There is a lot of noise. This test case looks more complicated than Ex 1 and 2, but the underlying logic should be the same. The vertical line looks like column 14. There are also a few deviations. The horizontal line is at row 14, and there is a \"gap\" in it. If I'm correct, I need to \"snap\" those deviations and \"fill\" those gaps. I am going back to Example 2 and 1 to be completely sure. I need to be 100% accurate.\n\n**Finalizing the Output**\n\nBy applying my rules (Snapping deviations, filling smaller gaps, and erasing noise), I now have the test input transformed into the output. The output's design should\n\nThe problem asks us to infer a transformation rule from two solved examples and apply it to a test input. The grids contain integer values representing colors.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Example 1**:\n    *   **Input**: Contains broken horizontal and vertical lines of color 6 (magenta) on a background of 1 (blue).\n        *   Vertical lines are at columns 4, 14, and 25.\n        *   Horizontal lines are at rows 3, 7, and 10.\n        *   The lines have gaps (missing pixels) and deviations (pixels slightly offset from the line).\n        *   Specifically, a pixel at (13, 10) is offset from the vertical line at x=14.\n        *   There are gaps in the vertical lines (e.g., x=14, y=10-12) and horizontal lines (e.g., y=7, x=15-17).\n    *   **Output**:\n        *   The deviations are fixed (snapped to the nearest line). The pixel at (13, 10) moves to (14, 10).\n        *   Gaps in the lines are filled to make them continuous segments.\n            *   The vertical line at x=14 becomes continuous from y=7 to y=15.\n            *   The horizontal line at y=7 fills the gap between the x=14 vertical and the segment starting at x=18.\n        *   However, not all gaps are filled. The horizontal gap on row 3 between the segment at x=0..2 and the vertical at x=4 is preserved. The gap on row 7 between x=20 and x=24 is preserved. This suggests that gaps are filled primarily when they connect valid line segments or bridge a broken line, especially between vertical anchors.\n\n2.  **Example 2**:\n    *   **Input**: Broken lines of color 3 (green) on 0 (black).\n        *   Deviated pixels (diagonal or offset by 1-2 pixels) appear near vertical lines (e.g., at x=18 on the right, and near the bottom of x=11).\n        *   There are scattered \"noise\" pixels that do not form a coherent line (e.g., diagonals in the bottom right).\n    *   **Output**:\n        *   Vertical lines are repaired to be straight and continuous.\n        *   Deviated pixels are snapped to the main vertical axis (e.g., offset pixels near x=18 are moved to x=18).\n        *   Gaps in the main vertical lines are filled.\n        *   Scattered noise pixels that cannot be snapped to a main line are removed.\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\n1.  **Identify underlying lines**: Detect the intended vertical and horizontal lines based on the majority of pixels.\n2.  **Repair lines**:\n    *   **Snap deviations**: Move pixels that are slightly offset (distance 1-2) from a main line onto the line.\n    *   **Fill gaps**: Fill missing pixels in the lines to make them continuous segments.\n    *   **Connect segments**: If a horizontal gap exists between two vertical lines (or a vertical and a substantial segment), fill it.\n3.  **Remove noise**: Delete isolated pixels or small diagonal clusters that do not fit the grid structure and cannot be snapped to a nearby line.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Background**: 8 (teal). **Pattern**: 9 (maroon).\n*   **Vertical Line 1**: The majority of pixels in column 14 (rows 0-28) suggest a vertical line.\n    *   Input has gaps at y=22, 26 and deviations at (15, 20) and (16, 21).\n    *   **Action**: Snap deviations to column 14 and fill gaps. The line becomes a continuous vertical bar of 9s at x=14 from y=0 to y=28.\n*   **Vertical Line 2**: Pixels in column 6 (rows 3-14) form a vertical line.\n    *   Deviations/Noise at (4,4) and (3,5) are diagonal offsets. Since the line x=6 is solid there, these are noise.\n    *   **Action**: Create a continuous vertical line at x=6 from y=3 to y=14. Remove deviations.\n*   **Horizontal Line 1**: Row 14 contains a long segment x=0..9 and a segment x=13..14.\n    *   Gap at x=10, 11, 12. This gap sits between the vertical line system at x=6 and the vertical line at x=14.\n    *   **Action**: Fill the gap. The line becomes continuous from x=0 to x=14.\n*   **Horizontal Line 2**: Row 3 has segments at x=0,1 and x=5,6 and x=14.\n    *   The gap between x=1 and x=5 is preserved (similar to Example 1 where initial gaps near edges were kept). The segment at x=5,6 is attached to the vertical at x=6.\n    *   **Action**: Preserve pixels at x=0,1 and x=5 (x=6 and x=14 are handled by vertical lines).\n*   **Noise Removal**:\n    *   Pixels at (4,4), (3,5), (12,11), (11,12), (2,15), (3,16) are isolated or form diagonals that do not integrate into the grid structure. They are removed.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\n*   Grid size: 29x17. Background 8.\n*   **Col 14**: Set to 9 for all rows 0-28.\n*   **Col 6**: Set to 9 for rows 3-14.\n*   **Row 14**: Set to 9 for cols 0-14.\n*   **Row 3**: Set to 9 for cols 0, 1, 5. (Cols 6 and 14 are already set).\n\n```text\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n```",

with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Exploration**\n\nOkay, so the task at hand is to solve an ARC challenge based on two examples and a test input. Let's dig in. It seems the input consists of grids with background and foreground colors, and the goal is to transform these grids in some way.\n\n**Example 1: Hypothesis Formation**\n\nI'm starting by analyzing the first example, focusing on identifying patterns and changes between the input and output. The background color in example one is blue (`1`), and the shapes are magenta (`6`). I'm looking for distinct shapes, like lines and connected components. I'm noting specific coordinates of the magenta pixels. There are both vertical and horizontal lines of color `6`. It appears there are \"gaps\" in the lines. I then compare the input and output, noting a specific row as an interesting point of analysis. It looks like the output merges segments from the input when there is a short gap between them. Hmm, the rule might involve \"healing\" broken lines.  I start to hypothesize that removing \"noise\" pixels that don't belong to any apparent lines and completing the existing lines is crucial. This leads me to examine how \"broken\" lines (lines with gaps) are being treated and what constitutes a \"valid\" line.\n\n**Example 1: Rule Refinement**\n\nThe exploration continues by looking at isolated pixels, determining their characteristics and how they are handled. I look at different horizontal and vertical lines, with varying lengths and gaps, in search of more details of the process. I identify \"objects\" and try to determine the rule for merging or splitting lines.  A pattern emerges: isolated, single-pixel segments are removed. However, to fill a gap, there might have to be alignment or intersecting perpendicular lines. It seems short segments are removed but longer segments are kept, but now I'm trying to figure out if there is a threshold, or if they need to be connected to a larger segment. I formulate a hypothesis that combines removing noise (isolated pixels) and completing lines (merging segments with small gaps). It looks like the logic involves identifying horizontal and vertical line structures.\n\n**Example 2: Rule Validation and Adjustment**\n\nI then shift my focus to the second example to test my hypothesis. The foreground color is green (`3`). There's a set of \"dots\", potentially part of some underlying structure. Now I start to see \"shifted\" or \"diagonal\" pixels, which might be noise. There is a lot of noise removal and line completion going on. From this, the rule is forming more clearly. It seems there is a \"snap to grid\" effect, where diagonal or out-of-line pixels move to align to the horizontal or vertical lines. I refine my understanding of the noise removal and how this affects the grid. I test the idea of filtering out the noise by removing the pixel if it has no horizontal or vertical neighbors.\n\n**Synthesis and Test Input Analysis**\n\nWith these examples, I now have a solid grip on the task. I hypothesize that the task is \"Repair Lines\" or \"Snap to Grid\".\nThe process is:\n\n1.  Noise Removal.\n2.  Gap Filling (for short gaps only).\n\nThe test input contains teal background (`8`) and maroon foreground (`9`). There are vertical and horizontal lines in a pattern that is more complex than the examples. I now construct a map of where the pixels are. I map out the coordinates of the 9s. I see that the pixels are both noisy and can form structured shapes. I then determine the best method for removing noise and filling gaps. I start formulating the code to deal with all the rules. The pixels look like a construction, so I draw out the \"main\" lines.\n\n**Construction and Solution**\n\nThe task now becomes an exercise in identifying the line segments, drawing out where they should be, and using a loop to filter and fill in any gaps or noise. I finalize the rules and go through the Test Input one final time to verify that my analysis is correct. It all looks perfect! With my rules in place, I can construct the final output. The main structural lines are vertical line at x=14 from y=0 to y=28, horizontal line y=14 from x=0 to x=14, vertical line at x=6, y=3..14, and horizontal line at y=3 from x=0 to x=6. I am now confident about constructing the output matrix. I have completely validated my approach and generated the output.\n\n\n\nThe problem asks us to infer a transformation rule from two examples and apply it to a test input. The grids contain integer values representing colors.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains horizontal and vertical lines of color `6` (magenta) on a background of `1` (blue). The lines have gaps (missing pixels) and there is \"noise\" (isolated pixels scattered diagonally).\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   **Noise Removal:** Isolated pixels that do not form part of the main horizontal or vertical lines are removed (e.g., pixels at (3,19), (8,17), etc.).\n        *   **Gap Filling:** Gaps in the lines are filled. For instance, in Row 7, a gap of 3 pixels between two segments was filled to create a continuous line. Note that not all gaps are filled; specifically, gaps crossed by a perpendicular line *terminating* at the gap (like the gap at Row 7, Cols 3-5 crossed by the vertical line at Col 4) might remain. However, gaps that simply connect segments of a single line are filled.\n    *   **Output:** Clean, continuous lines forming a cohesive structure.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains broken lines of color `3` (green) on `0` (black). It also contains \"shifted\" pixels (e.g., in column 18, some pixels are at 19 or 20).\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   **Line Repair:** The vertical line at Column 18 is repaired. The shifted pixels are removed, and the gap in the column is filled.\n        *   **Gap Filling:** A horizontal gap in Row 9 is filled.\n    *   **Output:** Continuous vertical and horizontal lines.\n\n**Logic Applied to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Background:** `8` (teal).\n*   **Foreground:** `9` (maroon).\n*   **Identify Structures:**\n    *   **Vertical Line (Column 14):** The input has a nearly continuous line in column 14 from row 0 to 19, then shifted pixels in rows 20-21, a gap in 22, segments in 23-25 and 27-28. Following the logic, we treat this as a single continuous vertical line spanning the full height (Rows 0-28). The shifted pixels (noise) are removed, and the gaps are filled.\n    *   **Vertical Line (Column 6):** The input shows a clear vertical segment in column 6 from Row 3 to Row 13.\n    *   **Horizontal Line (Row 14):** There is a segment from Col 0 to 9, a gap at 10-12, and a segment at 13-14. This gap connects the left segment to the vertical spine at Col 14. We fill this gap to form a line from Col 0 to 14.\n    *   **Horizontal Line (Row 3):** There is a segment at Col 0-1, a gap at 2-4, and a segment at 5-6. The segment at 5-6 connects to the top of the vertical line at Col 6. We fill the gap to form a line from Col 0 to 6.\n    *   **Noise Removal:** Isolated pixels appearing at (4,4), (5,3), (11,12), (12,11), (15,2), (16,3), (20,15), and (21,16) are removed. They do not align with the reconstructed lines.\n\n**Reconstructed Lines:**\n1.  **Vertical Line:** Column 14, Rows 0 to 28.\n2.  **Horizontal Line:** Row 14, Columns 0 to 14.\n3.  **Vertical Line:** Column 6, Rows 3 to 14 (connecting the two horizontal lines).\n4.  **Horizontal Line:** Row 3, Columns 0 to 6.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\n*   Initialize grid with background `8`.\n*   Set `(row, col)` to `9` if:\n    *   `col == 14` (for all rows)\n    *   `row == 14` AND `col <= 14`\n    *   `col == 6` AND `3 <= row <= 14`\n    *   `row == 3` AND `col <= 6`\n\nThe output matches these coordinates.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "From the examples, the \u201cdrawing\u201d color forms mostly horizontal/vertical 1-cell-thick lines, but the input may contain *staircase/diagonal* pixels that are connected only diagonally.  \nThe transformation \u201corthogonalizes\u201d the drawing:\n\n1. **Find diagonal-only pixels** of the drawing color: a cell of the drawing color that has **no** same-colored neighbor in the 4-neighborhood (up/down/left/right) but **does** have at least one same-colored **diagonal** neighbor.\n2. Group these diagonal-only pixels into diagonal chains.  \n   - If such a chain touches (diagonally) a **true line pixel** (a drawing-color cell that *does* have a 4-neighbor of the drawing color), then **project** the chain onto that line:\n     - If the touched line is **horizontal** (the touch-point has a left/right neighbor), move the chain\u2019s pixels onto that **row** (keep columns).\n     - If the touched line is **vertical** (the touch-point has an up/down neighbor), move the chain\u2019s pixels onto that **column** (keep rows).\n   - If a diagonal-only chain touches **no** true line, it is **deleted**.\n3. **Fill 1-cell gaps** on straight lines: any pattern `9,8,9` in a row (or column) becomes `9,9,9`.\n\nApplied to the test grid (background 8, drawing color 9):\n- The diagonal chain at (4,4)-(5,3) attaches to the horizontal segment on row 3, so it is moved up to row 3 and the single gap at (3,2) is filled.\n- The diagonal pixel at (16,3) attaches to the vertical segment at column 2, so it moves to (16,2).\n- The diagonal chain at (20,15)-(21,16) attaches to the vertical line at column 14, so it moves to column 14; then the 1-cell gaps at (22,14) and (26,14) are filled.\n- The isolated diagonal pair at (11,12)-(12,11) is removed.\n\nFinal output grid:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8",
