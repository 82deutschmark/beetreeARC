        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Strategy for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where the goal is to transform grid-based inputs. I need to analyze a few examples and deduce the underlying rule for these transformations. Let's dig in.\n\nThe first example is an 11x11 grid split into quadrants by magenta lines. It looks like the output takes these quadrants, extracts their 5x5 cores, and stacks them vertically, with magenta separators. The order of these stacks matters. I'm seeing a correlation between the number of non-background (colored) pixels in the input quadrant and the order in the output. It seems like the output sorts these qudrants by the *ascending* number of pixels. Also, in case of equal pixel count, there seems to be a tie breaker: later input quadrant goes last (in terms of reading the input, top-left, then top-right, etc.).\n\nNow, with the second example, I have a vertical stack. Its output is horizontal. Here, unlike in the square-ish input, the output order is sorting the blocks in *descending* order based on their pixel counts. Again, ties are broken by reversing the order in which blocks appeared in the input.\n\nThe third example is a horizontal row and it outputs a vertical stack. It sorts again in *descending* order. And again it respects the tie-breaking rule.\n\nIt appears the following rules are at work here:\n\n1.  **Block Extraction:** 5x5 blocks are extracted from the input grid.\n2.  **Pixel Count:** The number of non-background pixels are counted for each block.\n3.  **Transformation Type:** The input shape (square/vertical stack/horizontal row) determines the output layout (vertical stack/horizontal row).\n4.  **Sorting Direction:** The transformation type also determines the direction of the sort. Inputs square-ish produce a vertical output and sort *ascending*, whereas inputs vertical or horizontal produce *descending* sorts.\n5.  **Tie-Breaking:** If two blocks have an equal number of pixels, I've noticed that their initial ordering in the *input* is reversed in the *output* in the case of a tie.\n\nNow, for the test input. It's a vertical stack (23x5). Applying the same transformation as Ex 2 (a vertical to horizontal transformation), it should produce a horizontal output (5xN). This means the rule is that with a vertical input, the output is horizontal, sorting Descending.  I have to determine the precise width (or size) of this output which should be easy from the given 5x5 blocks from input separated by magenta. After carefully analyzing the provided grid, I can see the pixel counts for each block and its content. I'll need to sort them in *descending* order, then applying my tie breaking rule. Now, I have all I need to assemble the output with separators (vertical magenta lines).\n\n\nThe transformation rule inferred from the examples is as follows:\n\n1.  **Decompose**: The input grid is composed of 5x5 subgrids (containing patterns on a background of 7s) separated by magenta (6) lines. We first extract all these 5x5 blocks.\n    *   In Example 1, a 2x2 arrangement of blocks is converted to a vertical stack.\n    *   In Example 2, a vertical stack of blocks is converted to a horizontal row.\n    *   In Example 3, a horizontal row of blocks is converted to a vertical stack.\n    *   **Logic for Test Input**: The test input is a 23x5 grid, which is a vertical stack of four 5x5 blocks. Based on Example 2, a vertical stack input transforms into a horizontal row output.\n\n2.  **Sort**: The blocks are reordered based on the count of non-background (non-7) pixels within them.\n    *   In Example 1 (Square input $\\to$ Vertical output), blocks are sorted in **Ascending** order of pixel count.\n    *   In Example 2 (Vertical input $\\to$ Horizontal output), blocks are sorted in **Descending** order of pixel count.\n    *   In Example 3 (Horizontal input $\\to$ Vertical output), blocks are sorted in **Descending** order of pixel count.\n    *   **Logic for Test Input**: Since the input is a vertical stack (like Example 2), we will sort the blocks in **Descending** order of their non-background pixel count.\n\n3.  **Tie-Breaking**: If two blocks have the same pixel count, their relative order is the **reverse** of their appearance in the input (reading top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n    *   Example 1: TR (7 pixels) appears before BR (7 pixels). In output, BR appears before TR.\n    *   Example 2: Azure (7 pixels) appears before Red (7 pixels). In output, Red appears before Azure.\n    *   **Logic for Test Input**: We will apply this reverse-order tie-breaking rule.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Extract Blocks**:\n    *   **Block 1 (Top)**: Maroon (9) pattern. Count = 6 pixels.\n    *   **Block 2 (Middle-Top)**: Red (2) pattern. Count = 6 pixels.\n    *   **Block 3 (Middle-Bottom)**: Red (2) pattern. Count = 7 pixels.\n    *   **Block 4 (Bottom)**: Maroon (9) pattern. Count = 6 pixels.\n\n2.  **Sort**:\n    *   Primary Key (Count Descending): Block 3 (7) comes first.\n    *   The remaining blocks (1, 2, 4) all have a count of 6.\n    *   Secondary Key (Reverse Input Order): The input order is 1, 2, 4. Reversing this gives the order 4, 2, 1.\n    *   **Final Order**: Block 3, Block 4, Block 2, Block 1.\n\n3.  **Construct Output**:\n    *   Layout: Horizontal row of blocks separated by vertical magenta (6) lines.\n    *   Sequence: Block 3 | 6 | Block 4 | 6 | Block 2 | 6 | Block 1.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n\n*   **Block 3**:\n    ```\n    7,7,2,7,7\n    7,2,2,2,7\n    7,7,7,2,7\n    7,7,7,2,7\n    7,7,7,2,7\n    ```\n*   **Block 4**:\n    ```\n    7,7,7,7,7\n    7,7,7,9,7\n    7,7,9,9,7\n    7,9,9,7,7\n    7,9,7,7,7\n    ```\n*   **Block 2**:\n    ```\n    7,2,7,7,7\n    7,2,7,7,7\n    7,2,2,7,7\n    7,7,2,7,7\n    7,7,2,7,7\n    ```\n*   **Block 1**:\n    ```\n    7,7,7,9,7\n    7,7,9,9,7\n    7,9,9,7,7\n    7,9,7,7,7\n    7,7,7,7,7\n    ```\n\nCombining these side-by-side with '6' as separators:\n\noutput:\n7,7,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,9,7\n7,2,2,2,7,6,7,7,7,9,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,9,9,7\n7,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,9,9,7,6,7,2,2,7,7,6,7,9,9,7,7\n7,7,7,2,7,6,7,9,9,7,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,6,7,9,7,7,7\n7,7,7,2,7,6,7,9,7,7,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**The Journey of an ARC Problem Solver**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. I'm faced with this ARC problem. It's time to break it down.\n\nFirst, the examples. Example 1 is a 2x2 grid that becomes a tall stack. I'm focusing on those '6' dividers. They separate the tiles. The cool thing is each quadrant in the input map has a unique digital content (like red 2s, yellow 4s, etc.). The output rearranges these tiles into a vertical column. Initial thought, and this may be wrong, is \"how are they ordering that column?\" My first inclination is \"pixel count\". 4 (red), 6 (yellow), 7 (green), 10 (blue). That order is ascending (and this is really important: red comes first (in the lower-left). \n\nExample 2: This time, we go from a tall stack to a wide row. Here, the values are teal, red and Maroon. I'm seeing it's a 3x1 map. The pixels are 6 each. Order is reversed. From top->bottom, this reverses to the right. \n\nExample 3 is similar to Ex 2. This time it's wide (right to left), and in the output, it is tall (top to bottom). This is easy enough. \n\nSo it's a rotation of sorts, and \"sort by non-background pixels.\"\n\nThen, let's step back, and look at the general shape of the macro-grid.  The grids and separations. The key is \"What do the grids look like\"? \n\nHere's my general rule:\n1. If Tall (Vertically Dominant), then Output to Horizontal.\n2. If Wide (Horizontally Dominant), then Output to Vertical.\n3. If Square (Equal Dimension), then Output to Vertical.\n\n*   The sort, now.\n    Ex 1 (Square) has an ascending order, after sorting the values.\n    Ex 2 (Tall) had equal pixel counts.\n    Ex 3 (Wide) had a descending order after sorting for pixel count.\n\nThe test's input is tall. I expect a horizontal output. Should I follow Ex 1 or Ex 2? Ex 1 gave us ascending order. Ex 2 should apply \"Reverse of input\".  I notice a trend. Ex 1 has vertical separators (like columns), while Ex 2 has horizontal (like rows). Test input will get \n**Descending Order**.  \n\nTherefore, I have a method, it is this:\n1.  **Count Non-Background Pixels of Each Tile**.\n2.  **Sort The Tiles by Descending Order** and keep the same spatial locations\n3.  **Construct an output map**\n\nOkay, here's where I have to choose. Do I assume 4 blocks and reverse? Or 3 blocks and descending? I believe the key detail here is the separators. Vertical lines = Descending Sort.\nTherefore: This should be DESCENDING! This matches EX2 pattern. Reverse order, with the correct layout. \n\nMy output will be B3, B4, B2, and B1.  I believe the task is solved.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from three examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Structure:** The grids are composed of 5x5 sub-blocks (tiles) containing colored shapes on a background of 7s. These tiles are separated by rows or columns of 6s.\n2.  **Transformation Rule - Sorting by Pixel Count:**\n    *   **Example 1:** Input is a 2x2 arrangement of tiles. The tiles are rearranged into a 4x1 vertical stack.\n        *   Pixel counts of shapes: Top-Left (2s) = 4, Bottom-Right (3s) = 6, Top-Right (4s) = 7, Bottom-Left (1s) = 10.\n        *   Output order: 2s, 3s, 4s, 1s.\n        *   Observation: The output is sorted by **pixel count in Ascending order**.\n    *   **Example 3:** Input is a 1x3 horizontal row. The tiles are rearranged into a 3x1 vertical stack.\n        *   Pixel counts: Left (8s) = 6, Middle (1s) = 5, Right (9s) = 4.\n        *   Output order: 8s, 1s, 9s.\n        *   Observation: The output is sorted by **pixel count in Descending order**.\n    *   **Example 2:** Input is a 3x1 vertical stack. The tiles are rearranged into a 1x3 horizontal row.\n        *   Pixel counts: Top (8s) = 6, Middle (2s) = 6, Bottom (9s) = 6. All are equal.\n        *   Output order: 9s, 2s, 8s.\n        *   Observation: The output is the **reverse of the input order** (Bottom, Middle, Top). This serves as the tie-breaking mechanism or the rule for linear stacks.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule - Layout:**\n    *   If the Input is **Tall** (Height > Width), the Output becomes **Wide** (Horizontal Row). (Example 2).\n    *   If the Input is **Wide** or **Square**, the Output becomes **Tall** (Vertical Stack). (Examples 1 and 3).\n\n4.  **Synthesis for Test Input:**\n    *   **Input Shape:** The test input is a **Tall** grid (23x5), consisting of a vertical stack of 4 tiles separated by rows of 6s.\n    *   **Target Layout:** Since the input is Tall, the output must be **Wide** (Horizontal Row).\n    *   **Sorting Logic:** Based on the \"Linear vs Grid\" distinction observed:\n        *   Grid inputs (Ex 1) sort Ascending.\n        *   Linear inputs (Ex 3) sort Descending.\n        *   Therefore, the Test Input (Linear) should be sorted **Descending**.\n    *   **Tie-Breaking:** Example 2 (Tall Linear) reversed the input order for ties. We will apply the same logic: ties are resolved by taking the blocks in **Reverse Input Order** (Bottom to Top).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Blocks:**\n    *   **Block 1 (Top):** Shape made of 9s.\n    *   **Block 2:** Shape made of 2s.\n    *   **Block 3:** Shape made of 2s (different shape).\n    *   **Block 4 (Bottom):** Shape made of 9s.\n\n2.  **Count Pixels:**\n    *   **Block 1:** 6 pixels (9s).\n    *   **Block 2:** 6 pixels (2s).\n    *   **Block 3:** 7 pixels (2s).\n    *   **Block 4:** 6 pixels (9s).\n\n3.  **Sort:**\n    *   **Primary Sort (Count Descending):** Block 3 (7 pixels) comes first.\n    *   **Secondary Sort (Ties):** Blocks 1, 2, and 4 have 6 pixels.\n        *   Input order: B1, B2, B4.\n        *   Reverse Input Order: B4, B2, B1.\n    *   **Final Sequence:** Block 3, Block 4, Block 2, Block 1.\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Arrange the blocks horizontally, separated by columns of 6s.\n    *   Order: [Block 3] | 6 | [Block 4] | 6 | [Block 2] | 6 | [Block 1].\n\n**Block Details for Output:**\n*   **Block 3:** `7,7,2,7,7 / 7,2,2,2,7 / 7,7,7,2,7 / 7,7,7,2,7 / 7,7,7,2,7`\n*   **Block 4:** `7,7,7,7,7 / 7,7,7,9,7 / 7,7,9,9,7 / 7,9,9,7,7 / 7,9,7,7,7`\n*   **Block 2:** `7,2,7,7,7 / 7,2,7,7,7 / 7,2,2,7,7 / 7,7,2,7,7 / 7,7,2,7,7`\n*   **Block 1:** `7,7,7,9,7 / 7,7,9,9,7 / 7,9,9,7,7 / 7,9,7,7,7 / 7,7,7,7,7`\n\nOutput grid size: 5 rows, 23 columns (4 blocks * 5 width + 3 separators).\n\n7,7,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,9,7\n7,2,2,2,7,6,7,7,7,9,7,6,7,2,7,7,7,6,7,7,9,9,7\n7,7,7,2,7,6,7,7,9,9,7,6,7,2,2,7,7,6,7,9,9,7,7\n7,7,7,2,7,6,7,9,9,7,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,6,7,9,7,7,7\n7,7,7,2,7,6,7,9,7,7,7,6,7,7,2,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7",
