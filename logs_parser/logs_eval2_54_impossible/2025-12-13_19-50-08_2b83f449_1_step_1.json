        "Full raw LLM response": "**The Algorithm**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan for solving this ARC puzzle. My mission is to decode the transformation rules by carefully comparing the input and output grids provided in the examples, and then use that knowledge to predict the output grid for the test input.\n\n**Deconstructing the Examples**\n\nI'm starting by meticulously analyzing Example 1. The input and output grids have the same dimensions, which is a good sign. It's clear that there's a color transformation happening. Specifically, those '7's in the input are morphing into something else in the output, which is the key.\n\n**Spotting the Pattern**\n\nI'm focusing on those groups of '7,7,7' in the input grid. When I look at the corresponding output, I see that they transform into '8,6,8'. Bingo! The '6' seems to be the critical element, and it appears in the center of the '7,7,7' group. There's more to it, though. I notice a pattern of vertical lines of '6's. Where a '7,7,7' existed, the output has a '6' in that same column in the row above, the row itself, and the row below. This creates a vertical \"cross\" shape of sorts.\n\n**The Magic of Walls**\n\nOkay, I'm calling it: those magenta '6's are acting like \"walls\" in the output. They are the key to the pattern. It's not just the 6, however. The numbers surrounding this 6 create a special shape.\n\nThe '3's in the input, seem to behave differently. I've been watching their behavior. This isn't just about color changes, it's about movement as well. They seem to grow in some cases or fill space. I realize I need to understand them in terms of those \"walls\".\n\n**The Falling hypothesis**\n\nAt first, I thought the '3's were just falling down. But this is not correct. I see they disappear in some instances. They behave a lot less predictably, so I look for a more complex process.\n\n**The Seed idea**\n\nNow I have an idea. The '3's are seed and filling chambers! The chambers are defined by these '6's walls. And also by '0's. I realize that the '3's, when found in the starting input or when generated by \"filling\", act like a seed and grow outward. The seed fills the 8 space. These are special and trigger the growth of more '3's into that space.\n\n**Growth Rules**\n\nNow I am seeing this more clearly: the even rows are my key. The '3's are born from '8's that connect to a source - input seeds. So the space left between walls has some connection to the starting '3's or '0's. They seem to grow and fill empty space. The rules are related to the behavior of the walls. It looks like the '3's fill the gap, and the walls are the boundaries.\n\n**The Code**\n\n1.  **Skeletons**: I establish a framework. Generate grid based on input. Find the '7's. Transform to `8,6,8`.\n2.  **Filling**: Each `8` in an even row is examined.\n    - Check if the left boundary and right boundary widens.\n    - The rule: If the chamber opens up and widens on the edge then a seed can appear.\n    - So I check the distance from the wall above and wall below. I also check the delta.\n    - The width affects the amount of growth.\n3.  **Last Row Case**: The last row has special behavior. It follows all rules, but may be a bit stable. I still need to make sure this fills with seed as needed.\n4.  **`0` Logic**: The `0`'s work as a \"seed\". They always spawn growth. I can test with any `0` in a row.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input**\n\nI will now execute this. First, I generate the framework and put '0's to keep the data. From my knowledge, I can then test the input with the rules and get the result. Using the rules. I'll test each location and put the `3`s into place. This is where I'll apply all my hard work. I know that if I have this working, I have solved the puzzle!\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, I analyzed the input and output grids from the examples to determine the transformation rules.\n\n**1. Grid Structure and Background:**\n- The grid consists of alternating \"pattern\" rows (odd rows) and \"canvas\" rows (even rows).\n- **Odd Rows (1, 3, 5...)**: These contain generators marked by `7,7,7` sequences against a background of `0`s. In the output, these `7,7,7` segments are transformed into `8,6,8` (where `6` is the center). The `0`s remain `0`s.\n- **Even Rows (0, 2, 4...)**: These act as canvases initialized with `8`s (teal). They can contain `0`s (black) and `3`s (green) in the input. In the output, `6`s (magenta) appear as \"walls\" projected from the odd rows above and below. `3`s (green) fill specific regions based on the movement of these walls.\n\n**2. Placement of Walls (`6`):**\n- A `7,7,7` centered at column `c` in an odd row `r` generates a `6` at column `c` in the even rows immediately above (`r-1`) and below (`r+1`).\n- These `6`s act as barriers or walls within the even rows.\n- If multiple `6`s land in the same row, they divide the row into segments or chambers.\n\n**3. Placement of Green (`3`) Cells:**\n- Green cells appear in even rows, typically starting from the left (column 0) or right (last column) edges, or adjacent to existing `0`s.\n- **Expansion Rule:** We compare the position of the walls in the row above (`Top Wall`) and the row below (`Bot Wall`) relative to the current even row.\n    - **Left Edge:** If the leftmost wall moves to the left (i.e., `Bot Wall Index` < `Top Wall Index`), the chamber widens. This expansion allows `3`s to grow from the left edge (column 0).\n    - **Right Edge:** If the rightmost wall moves to the left (i.e., `Bot Wall Index` < `Top Wall Index`), the chamber on the right widens (since the wall receding left opens up space on the right). This allows `3`s to grow from the right edge.\n    - Conversely, if the walls move in a way that narrows the chamber (Left Wall moves Right, or Right Wall moves Right), the `3`s die (are replaced by `8`).\n- **Quantity Rule:** The number of `3`s spawned depends on the magnitude of the wall shift (`Delta = Top - Bot`).\n    - If `Delta` is even, spawn two `3`s (`3,3`).\n    - If `Delta` is odd, spawn one `3`.\n- **Zero (`0`) Rule:** If a `0` exists in an even row, a `3` appears adjacent to it, typically in the direction of the open space (away from the nearest boundary/wall).\n- **Special Case:** If a row has no walls above or below (e.g., due to an empty odd row), we treat the wall position as effectively -1 (far left) or infinite (far right).\n- **Last Row:** The last row behaves as if expanding, retaining single `3`s at the edges.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n- **Row 0:** Wall at 10. Derived from Row 1. No Row -1. `3`s die. -> `8...8,6,8...8`\n- **Row 1:** Source at 10. -> `...0,8,6,8,0...`\n- **Row 2:** Wall Top 10, Bot 13. Left Wall moves Right (Narrows). No `3`s. -> `8...6...6...8`\n- **Row 3:** Source at 13. -> `...0,8,6,8,0...`\n- **Row 4:** Wall Top 13, Bot None (-1). 13 -> -1. Widens Left. Delta 14 (Even). Spawn `3,3` at left and right. `0` at 7 gets `3` at 8. -> `3,3,8...0,3...6...3,3`\n- **Row 5:** No sources. -> `0...0`\n- **Row 6:** Wall Top None (-1), Bot 7. -1 -> 7. Moves Right (Narrows Left). No `3`s. -> `8...6...8`\n- **Row 7:** Source at 7. -> `...0,8,6,8,0...`\n- **Row 8:** Wall Top 7, Bot 4. 7 -> 4. Moves Left. Widens. Delta 3 (Odd). Spawn `3` at edges. -> `3,8...6...6...3`\n- **Row 9:** Source at 4. -> `...0,8,6,8,0...`\n- **Row 10:** Wall Top 4, Bot None. 4 -> -1. Moves Left. Widens. Delta 5 (Odd). Spawn `3` at edges. `0` at 10 gets `3` at 9. -> `3,8...6...3,0...3`\n- **Row 11:** No sources. -> `0...0`\n- **Row 12:** Wall Top None, Bot 10. Narrows. No `3`s. -> `8...6...8`\n- **Row 13:** Source at 10. -> `...0,8,6,8,0...`\n- **Row 14:** Wall Top 10, Bot 7. 10 -> 7. Widens. Delta 3 (Odd). Spawn `3`. -> `3...6...6...3`\n- **Row 15:** Source at 7. -> `...0,8,6,8,0...`\n- **Row 16:** Wall Top 7, Bot 3. 7 -> 3. Widens Left. Delta 4 (Even). Spawn `3,3` Left. Right Wall 7 -> 12 (Narrows Right). No `3` Right. -> `3,3,8...6...6...6...8`\n- **Row 17:** Sources at 3, 12. -> `...8,6,8...8,6,8...`\n- **Row 18:** Last row. Walls 3, 12. Spawn `3` at edges. `0` at 7 gets `3` at 8. -> `3,8...6...0,3...6...3`\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0\n3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8\n0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0\n3,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**The ARC Problem: A Deep Dive into Pattern Recognition**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I'm staring down an ARC problem, and it's a doozy. It's all about figuring out a transformation rule from a few input-output examples. I'm seeing two main ingredients: horizontal lines of different colors, a set of recurring three-element patterns, and a need to predict the output grid.\n\n**Initial Observations & Example 1 Deconstruction:**\n\nFirst, I looked at example 1. The input grid is the same size as the output, so the problem's about transforming the colors or the positions, but not about resizing. I identified the colors: black, green, orange, and teal. Then I noticed the structure: alternating rows of horizontal lines. Certain rows contain segments of three orange pixels (`7, 7, 7`), while others have teal pixels (`8`). The output grid does change those `7`s, but the size stays the same. The triple `7, 7, 7` turns into `8, 6, 8`. A specific magenta color `6` replaces the middle `7`.\n\nThe key is what's around these orange groups. The rows above and below those orange segments got modified as well. This leads to the thought that `7, 7, 7` is a key pattern that 'triggers' this change. The `6` is somehow 'spreading' upwards and downwards from this pattern, changing some of the `8` color pixels in these rows.\n\n**Propagation Logic & Pattern Emergence:**\n\nI figured this transformation could have several logical patterns. I wondered if the `7, 7, 7` just changes its value or if it affects the whole line above and below. I had to look at the columns in this case. The column that had the `7, 7, 7`'s middle element was affected. The color change of the `7, 7, 7` to `8, 6, 8` would also affect the row above and below. This change was happening in a column-wise manner. I also found that an `8` in a column that corresponds to the `7,7,7`'s center will become `6`. It's like a vertical 'propagation' that only modifies the `8`. The `0` background color remains.\n\nThe `7,7,7` acts as the source for `6`s and affects its adjacent rows, generating the pattern `8,6,8`. However, I still had questions about the `3` color. I understood that the `3`s mark the line's borders. The `3`s were appearing and disappearing according to the transformation. The most difficult was understanding the `3` color. They are not as predictable. They only show up at certain places.\n\nI thought about these horizontal lines as a series of connected sections, where the `7, 7, 7` is the 'connector.' I had to think of a \"path\" and how the colors move along the grid. I had to redefine the relationship between the `6` and `3`. I realized that `6` is a marker for the `7, 7, 7`. The 6s just identify the position of the 7,7,7 elements vertically. They have no relationship with a path. This also means that the horizontal lines are just there as a skeleton. The horizontal lines don't transport anything. They are just the skeleton. The `3`s only indicate \"disconnected\".\n\n**Refining the Logic: Identifying Rules:**\n\nThe `3`s are linked to the concept of the path. They are at the path's ends or act as terminals. If the path reaches the grid's borders, there are no `3`s. I concluded a rule:\n\n*Rule 1: If a horizontal line has a `7,7,7`, transform it to `8,6,8`. The middle `6` marks a vertical path from the center of the segment. The lines above and below become `6`.\n*Rule 2: At the ends of the remaining segments, you'll find `3`. There is a complex relationship between the origin of the `3`s and their transformed values. If the row above a connector is a given column, then those ends become 8. If below a connector, then the end becomes `3`. If the distance is smaller than 4 from a 6, then 3 becomes `3,3`. If higher than 5, the ends become just `3`.\n*Rule 3: Original `3`'s are present. A new `3` value is only possible at the beginning and the end of each segment.\n\nI realized this is not a path-finding problem. There is no horizontal signal, only vertical\n\nTo solve this task, we analyze the relationship between the input and output grids based on the provided examples. The grids consist of horizontal \"wires\" (rows of 8s with 3s at the ends) on even rows and \"connectors\" (segments of 7s) on odd rows.\n\n### Rules inferred from examples:\n\n1.  **Connector Transformation (Odd Rows):**\n    *   Identify every segment of `7,7,7` in the odd rows of the input.\n    *   In the output, replace `7,7,7` with the pattern `8,6,8`.\n    *   The center column of this segment becomes a \"vertical via\". It propagates the color `6` to the immediate rows above and below.\n    *   **Rule:** If input row $r$ has `7,7,7` at columns $c-1, c, c+1$, then output row $r$ has `8,6,8` at those columns. Output row $r-1$ at column $c$ becomes `6`. Output row $r+1$ at column $c$ becomes `6`.\n\n2.  **Wire End Transformation (Even Rows):**\n    *   The horizontal lines on even rows act as wires connected by the vertical vias (`6`).\n    *   The endpoints of these wires (typically at the grid boundaries, but also at gaps `0`) change based on their vertical connection context.\n    *   For each wire segment, identify the **closest** vertical connector (`6`).\n    *   Determine the **vertical direction** of the connection:\n        *   **Top (Above):** If the `6` comes from the row *below* the current wire (i.e., current wire is \"above\" the `7,7,7` source), the wire is part of the \"Top\" side of the connection.\n        *   **Bottom (Below):** If the `6` comes from the row *above* the current wire (i.e., current wire is \"below\" the `7,7,7` source), the wire is part of the \"Bottom\" side of the connection.\n    *   **Apply End Rules:**\n        *   **If Top:** The ends of the wire segment become `8`. (Any existing `3`s turn into `8`s).\n        *   **If Bottom:** The ends of the wire segment become `3`.\n            *   If the distance from the connector to the end is **short** (approx $\\le 4$), and it's a grid boundary, it becomes `3,3` (two 3s growing inwards).\n            *   If the distance is **long** (approx $\\ge 5$), it becomes a single `3`.\n            *   Isolated segments (no connector) or segments in the \"sink\" (bottom-most rows) default to the \"Bottom\" behavior (ends become `3`).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution for Test Input:\n\n**Grid Size:** 13 rows x 17 columns (Indices 0-16).\n\n**1.
