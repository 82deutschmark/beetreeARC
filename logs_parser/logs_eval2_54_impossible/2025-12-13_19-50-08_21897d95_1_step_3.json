        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Thinking on this ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. The user, who knows their stuff, wants me to break down this problem. I have a few solved examples and a new test case to work with. Let's see...\n\nI'm initially trying to figure out if there's some kind of underlying structure \u2013 like are they transposing the image or maybe rotating it? I also look at how many colors there are in each image. I focus on the dimensions of the input/output grids and if they are the same or different. It seems like the output is some sort of simplified view or representation of the input. I look for repeating color blocks.\n\nMy first impression is that maybe the output is just the colors of the *inner* parts of the regions in the input. For each big block of color in the input image, I try to find those pixels with different color than its surroundings. I think maybe these are the *seed* colors. This turns out to be a good starting point, but it quickly gets complicated.\n\nThen I get this idea that maybe it's based on how different areas are next to each other in the input (I call it \"adjacency\" for short). But then I noticed that these different areas seem to get transformed into solid blocks, and I start to wonder if that adjacency is being preserved in a visual way. That isn't super obvious, but maybe I'm on the right track. I also start noticing these '1' pixels. They seem to be lining up with the borders between color regions.\n\nMy current theory: it\u2019s like mapping the different regions of the input to a cleaner grid in the output. And I'm starting to think that the single-color pixels *inside* the regions are clues about what that output should look like.\n\nOkay, I'm thinking about the boundaries now. The '1' pixels seem to outline the regions. Maybe they are *defining* those regions. So, I need to figure out the colors inside each of those shapes. I start to wonder if I can use the color *inside* a shape to figure out what it becomes in the output. The thing is, this isn't always straightforward. It\u2019s not a simple copy-and-paste.\n\nI start testing a few hypotheses. Maybe if a color region has this *inner seed* pixel of a different color, that's what that output region is going to be? And I look for patterns in the way these single-pixel colors are showing up in the output. I also look at how each region in the input relates to each of the regions in the output, and if they have any *seeds*. I test if it's based on the \"most frequent\" color, but this doesn't work. I get stuck a few times.\n\nI then focus on this concept of how these regions are linked or connected. And I try to visualize the way that each of these color blocks in the input relates to each of the color blocks in the output. That's when I get this big picture idea: It's like I'm looking at a 3D shape, and the grid in the input image is a distorted representation and the output is a *straightened out* or rectified view of that same shape.\n\nI'm thinking now about a mapping rule based on the concept of 'seeds' and the \"inner colors\". The *seeds* point to some other region, which means there is a propagation going on. So, then I think maybe that's the \"secret\" \u2013 finding which input regions map to which output colors?\n\nThen, I decide it\u2019s time to look at the test input more carefully, because maybe I can see something there that I didn't see before.\n\nHere's my logic for the test input: I identify the regions (9s, 7s, 3s, 4s, 6s, 2s). Now I'm carefully tracing any single pixels with unique colors in the test image, and seeing which ones map to the different color regions. I start thinking again in terms of an overall grid of blocks, I also identify that there is a vertical line made by the \"1\" pixels. And I start figuring out which one corresponds to each of the distinct regions.\n\nI'm thinking more generally about the output, and I realize it\u2019s going to be a smaller, cleaned-up version of the input, with the borders between different regions. Then I decide that I need a *strategy* for solving this test case. It involves identifying the regions, determining what the \"target color\" of each region should be, by the seeds and the inner colors, and then building the output.\n\nI also go back and refine the process of what happens when a color region doesn't have a single-pixel seed, it's called inheritance. What color do they get then\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples and the test input, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Region Identification**: The input grid is divided into rectangular(ish) regions separated by boundary lines (often color '1' or '9' acting as a background frame). In the test input, there is a clear 3x3 grid structure (3 vertical bands, 3 horizontal bands), though the top band merges the left and center columns.\n2.  **Geometry Rectification**: The irregular regions in the input are mapped to rectangular blocks in the output. The dimensions of these blocks correspond to the approximate boundaries in the input.\n    *   **Vertical Boundaries**: Based on the test input, the columns are split approximately at indices 0-11 (Left), 12-21 (Center), and 22-29 (Right).\n    *   **Horizontal Boundaries**: The rows are split at indices 0-6 (Top), 7-15 (Middle), and 16-29 (Bottom).\n3.  **Color Transformation (The \"Seed\" Rule)**: The color of each output block is determined by the \"content\" of the corresponding input region.\n    *   If a region contains a nested \"seed\" (a distinct inner region or pixel group of a different color), the output takes the color of that seed.\n    *   This can be recursive (e.g., Region A contains B, B contains C -> Output is C).\n    *   If a region has no seed, it retains its original color (or inherits from a neighbor/background).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Top Band (Rows 0-6):**\n    *   **Left Column (0-11):** Region is 9 (Background). No seed. -> **Output 9**.\n    *   **Center Column (12-21):** Region is 9 (Background). No seed. -> **Output 9**.\n    *   **Right Column (22-29):** Region is 7. No seed. -> **Output 7**.\n\n*   **Middle Band (Rows 7-15):**\n    *   **Left Column (0-11):** Region is 3. Contains a region of 0s. The 0-region contains a seed of 8s. (3 -> 0 -> 8). -> **Output 8**.\n    *   **Center Column (12-21):** Region is 2. Contains a seed of 9s. (2 -> 9). -> **Output 9**.\n    *   **Right Column (22-29):** Region is 4.

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of how I think I can solve this ARC puzzle:**\n\nIt looks like the goal is to transform a grid of blobs of colors into a cleaner, rectangular output. The examples are the keys. My first thought is to dig into the first example. The input grid has blobs of color with \"noise\" inside them.  The \"noise\" is a small group of different colored pixels inside the blob. The output grid looks like it's made up of rectangles. And, the colors in the output somehow relate to the input.\nSo, I start by comparing the input and output looking for pattern.\n\nI see that the output is composed of rectangles, I focus on the arrangement and colors and the shapes and positions of these rectangles relative to the Input.\n*   **Hypothesis 1:** Each blob \"points\" to a rectangle in the output? But how do I know which color? It seems related to the noise.\n*   **Hypothesis 2:** The output is a Transpose of the input.  I try to relate the input coordinates to the output.\n\nAfter playing around with Transpose and rotation, it hits me that the 1s, the \"noise\" or \"seed\" pixels, form crosses or lines. I then realize that the noise pixels do not form a region but a smaller shape that is inside the region. I make an inventory of the seed pixel and the output they produce.  The color is the key. I try to associate those colors.\n\nThe output colors don't cleanly correspond to the input container colors.  But they somehow relate to the colors of the *noise* inside.  In Ex 1, the output colors were 7, 3, and 0.  The \"noise\" was 1, 3, 9 and 0.  The backgrounds were 6, 7, 4 and 8.  I try a mapping strategy. I try a matrix approach.  I try neighbor mapping. I try Transpose. I go back to it.\n\nThe breakthrough is that I see the Test Input is actually a pre-solved version. It has clean, rectangular blocks of the noise colors. The problem is a transformation that should extract these blocks.\n\nMy working hypothesis becomes: The input *is* the output, but \"noisy\". I need to reverse the noisy process and extract the pure color blocks. The \"noise\" pixels are the \"furniture\".  The output should reflect these furniture as clean areas. My plan is:\n\n*   **Transpose:** Get it in the correct \"orientation\".\n*   **Denoise:** The color of an output cell will be determined by the dominant noise within the Transposed cell in the Input. I create a mapping. The map is applied to noise, based on the regions.\nI come up with a final map based on the Test Input.\n\n```\n9, 7 -> 3\n3 -> 2\n6 -> 0\n2 -> 9\n8 -> 1\n4 -> 1\n0 -> 0\n1 -> 1\n```\n\nI'm confident in this approach.  The main idea is: identify the regions, replace each region's color according to a *fixed rule*.\n\n\nThe task involves transforming a grid of \"noisy\" colored regions into a grid of clean, solid rectangular blocks. The transformation follows these rules derived from the examples:\n\n1.  **Geometric Transformation:** The output grid is the **Transpose** of the input grid. (Rows become columns, columns become rows).\n2.  **Color Transformation:** Each region in the input (defined by a background color) maps to a specific color in the output. This output color is determined by the **dominant \"noise\" color** found inside that region in the input.\n\n**Analysis of the Test Input Regions & Dominant Noise:**\nThe Test Input is a 30x30 grid. We identify the regions and their contained noise blocks to build the color mapping:\n\n*   **Region 9 (Maroon):** Located at the top and left. Contains a large block of **3 (Green)** and a smaller block of 7 (Orange). The dominant noise is **3**.\n    *   Mapping: **9 -> 3**.\n*   **Region 3 (Green):** Located in the middle-left. Contains a very large block of **2 (Red)**, plus some 0s and 1s. The dominant noise is **2**.\n    *   Mapping: **3 -> 2**.\n*   **Region 6 (Magenta):** Located in the bottom-left. Contains a block of **0 (Grey)** and some 1s. The dominant noise is **0**.\n    *   Mapping: **6 -> 0**.\n*   **Region 2 (Red):** Located in the middle-bottom. Contains a block of **9 (Maroon)**.\n    *   Mapping: **2 -> 9**.\n*   **Region 8 (Azure):** Located in the bottom-right. Contains a block of **1 (Blue)**.\n    *   Mapping: **8 -> 1**.\n*   **Region 4 (Yellow):** Located on the right edge. Contains a block of **1 (Blue)**.\n    *   Mapping: **4 -> 1**.\n\n**Handling Noise Pixels:**\nThe pixels inside the regions that form the \"noise\" (e.g., the 7s inside the 9-region, or the 0s inside the 3-region) are treated as part of the region they inhabit.\n*   Pixels **7** (inside 9) map to the target of 9 -> **3**.\n*   Pixels **0** (inside 6) map to the target of 6 -> **0**.\n*   Pixels **0** (inside 3) map to the target of 3 -> **2**. (Note: In the final heuristic, we map 0->0 for simplicity as it aligns with the 6->0 region which is visually distinct, but strictly they should merge. Given 0 is the target for 6, we map 0 pixels to 0).\n*   Pixels **1** map to **1**.\n\n**Final Color Map:**\n*   9, 7 $\\rightarrow$ **3**\n*   3 $\\rightarrow$ **2**\n*   6, 0 $\\rightarrow$ **0**\n*   2 $\\rightarrow$ **9**\n*   8, 4, 1 $\\rightarrow$ **1**\n\n**Process:**\n1.  Read the Test Input grid (30x30).\n2.  Transpose it (swap $x, y$).\n3.  Apply the color map to every pixel.\n\n**Resulting Output Grid:**\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,1,1,1,1\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,1,1\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,1,1\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,1,1\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,1,1\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,1,1\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,1,1\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,1,1\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,1,1\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,1,1\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1\n3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1\n3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1",

The test input is 30\u00d730, so output will be 30\u00d730.\n\n2. **Cross patterns with special values**: I need to find crosses (patterns of 1s) where the center contains a non-1 value that differs from the surrounding region's color.\n\n3. **Region swapping**: The output shows regions where:\n   - Cross center values define new regions\n   - Adjacent regions swap colors based on the crosses\n   - A \"background\" color fills remaining areas\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nI identified key cross patterns with special center values:\n- At position (8, 6): value **8** within the 0 region\n- At position (28, 12): value **0** within the 9/8 boundary region\n\nThe main regions are: 3 (upper), 0 (middle-left), 2 (center), 6 (left), 4 (right), 7 (upper-right), 8 (lower-right), 9 (background)\n\nFollowing the transformation pattern from examples:\n- Cross values create stripes/regions in output\n- Regions are swapped based on adjacency relationships\n- The structure reflects the division created by cross positions\n\nBased on the cross positions and the transformation rules, the output shows reorganized regions with the cross center values (8 and 0) prominently featured, while other colors fill their corresponding swapped positions.\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation\n\nFrom the examples, two consistent behaviors stand out:\n\n1. **Color `1` acts like a \u201chole/noise\u201d value** inside otherwise solid regions.  \n   In every example, the output contains **no `1`s**. The `1`s get absorbed by the surrounding region color (i.e., replaced by the dominant adjacent non-1 color).\n\n2. **The final output is the transpose of the cleaned grid** (swap rows and columns).  \n   This explains why in the non-square examples (e.g. 16\u00d712 \u2192 12\u00d716, 14\u00d79 \u2192 9\u00d714) the dimensions swap.\n\nSo the procedure is:\n\n- **Step A (fill holes):** For every cell with value `1`, replace it with the surrounding region\u2019s color (practically: the majority of its non-1 orthogonal neighbors; in these inputs the hole is always clearly inside one region, so the fill value is unambiguous).\n- **Step B (transpose):** Output grid is the transpose of the filled grid.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\nI replaced each `1` by the obvious surrounding region color (e.g., `1` inside a `3` block becomes `3`, inside `9` becomes `9`, inside `0` becomes `0`, inside `2` becomes `2`, inside `8` becomes `8`, etc.).  \nThen I transposed the resulting 30\u00d730 grid.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9  \n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9  \n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9  \n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,0,9  \n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9  \n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8  \n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,8,8,8  \n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8  \n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8  \n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8  \n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8  \n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,8,8,8,8  \n9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,8,8,8,8  \n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,8,8,8,8  \n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8  \n9,9,7,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n9,7,7,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n9,7,7,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n9,9,7,7,7,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8  \n9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "## Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n### 1) Treat color `1` as \u201cconnector / instruction\u201d\nAll the examples contain many `1` cells. In the outputs, `1` never remains; instead, it triggers recoloring of the surrounding large regions.\n\nSo the first thing to do is to look at **connected components of `1`** (4-neighborhood connectivity).\n\n---\n\n### 2) Each connected `1`-component defines a cyclic recoloring rule\nFor a given connected component of `1`:\n\n1. Collect the set **S** of all **distinct non-1 colors** that touch this `1`-component (any cell of that color in 4-neighborhood of any `1` in the component).\n2. Sort **S** in **descending numeric order**.\n3. Define a **cycle mapping** along that order: each color becomes the next color in the list, wrapping around at the end.\n\nExample: if a `1`-component touches colors `{8,3,0}`, sorted descending gives `[8,3,0]`, so the mapping is:\n- `8 \u2192 3`\n- `3 \u2192 0`\n- `0 \u2192 8`\n\nThis rule matches the behavior in the examples where colors around `1`-structures rotate/permutate.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Apply the mapping to entire touching color-regions (not just boundary pixels)\nA large colored area (connected component of a non-1 color) that touches a `1`-component gets recolored **everywhere** according to that `1`-component\u2019s mapping.\n\nIf a colored region touches multiple `1`-components, choose the mapping from the **largest `1`-component** (by number of `1` cells).  \nIf there is still a tie, use the one with **more distinct adjacent colors**, and if still tied, the one whose top-left `1` is earliest in reading order.\n\nThis \u201clargest/strongest instruction wins\u201d behavior explains why some potential recolorings get overridden in the solved examples.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Finally remove `1` by filling it\nAfter recoloring the non-1 regions, each `1` cell is replaced by the most common color among its 4-neighbors in the recolored grid (in practice in these tasks it becomes the surrounding region color).\n\n---\n\n## Applying to the test input\n\nIn the test grid, the significant `1`-components (largest ones) induce stable region-wide substitutions; when you work through them with the rule above, the resulting recoloring on the major regions becomes:\n\n- `9 \u2192 3`\n- `3 \u2192 9`\n- `6 \u2192 2`\n- `2 \u2192 0`\n- `0 \u2192 6`\n- `4 \u2192 8`\n- large `8 \u2192 4`\n\nThere is also one **isolated `8`** near the upper-middle that is not connected to the big `8` region; it is controlled by a local `1`-component and becomes `3`.\n\nAll `1` cells are then filled from their recolored neighbors.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,3,3\n3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,3,3\n3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,9,9,3,3\n3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n3,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8\n3,9,9,9,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n3,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n3,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,4,4,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,4,4,4,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4",
