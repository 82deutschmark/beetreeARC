The task is to transform input grids to output grids, and I need to figure out the pattern.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\n*   **Background:** The input is a repeating pattern of teal (8) horizontal bars and black (0) spaces. The teal bars always have this \"3\" element at the start/end of a line, but its behavior in the output is, according to the hints, \"fixed\". We will see if the hint holds true to the test data.\n*   **Orange Markers:** There are orange markers, which are sets of three \"7\"s arranged horizontally. These trigger some kind of change.\n*   **Target:** The goal is to figure out how these orange '7's change to the output grid.\n*   **Hints:** The hints are \"The black horizontal-bar \u201cmaze\u201d and the green edge blocks stay fixed; the change is driven by the orange markers.\"\n\n**Hypotheses and Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Orange to Magenta (7 to 6) Transformation:** It looks like the orange \"7s\" are replaced by magenta \"6s\". A string of 3 7s will turn into a segment of a horizontal line of a string of 8,6,8. The magenta '6's seem to form a vertical bar that spans the height of the pattern.\n2.  **Magenta Propagation:** The output seems to have an upward and downward propagation of magenta '6' to the cells above and below the horizontal '6'.\n3.  **Black and Green Stability:** The black bars (0s) remain unchanged, as do the green \"3s\", according to the user.\n\n**Refining the Rule and Addressing Discrepancies:**\n\n*   **Verifying the \"Green\" Blocks:** I can see the \"3s\" (green) are NOT actually staying fixed in the examples! This is really confusing, but the hints for this specific use case, and to make it easier to start off the test case, states this should stay fixed. This hint is given for a reason for the test case, so I am going to hold onto it. If I don't, things get really complicated, really fast!\n*   **Refining the 7->6 Rule:** The core rule is: `7,7,7` becomes `8,6,8`. The \"6\" propagates one cell up and one cell down from where the middle `7` was.  The \"8\" replaces the 7.\n\n**Addressing the Strategy with \"Fixed 3s\":**\n\nSince the hint *specifically* mentions \"fixed green blocks,\" I'm going to follow this:\n\n1.  **Copy the Input.** Start by copying the entire input grid into the output.\n2.  **Apply the 7->6 Transformation.**\n    *   Find any sequence of `7,7,7` in the input.\n    *   Replace these cells with `8,6,8` horizontally.\n    *   Extend the '6' one row up and one row down by placing a '6' there.\n3.  **Keep 3s Fixed.** The 3s stay exactly where they are in the input.\n\n**Implementation Steps (Code):**\n\n1.  Parse the input grid into a data structure.\n2.  Find the `7,7,7` sequences (e.g., as lists of coordinates).\n3.  Create a copy of the input as the initial output.\n4.  Iterate over each `(r, c)` representing the *center* of the `7,7,7` sequence.\n    *   Modify `output[r][c-1] = 8`, `output[r][c] = 6`, `output[r][c+1] = 8`.\n    *   If valid, modify `output[r-1][c] = 6`, and `output[r+1][c] = 6`.\n5.  All other values, especially the '3's, remain unchanged.\n6.  Format the output grid.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nI will generate the output, apply the rules. I'll make sure there are no unintended collisions, and that the 3s are untouched (except when the transformation logic overwrites them, which shouldn't happen with the edges in this case).\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of colored numbers. Based on the solved examples and the specific hints provided, the transformation involves identifying orange markers (7s) in the input grid and converting them into magenta (6) and teal (8) structures that connect the horizontal teal (8) bars.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Orange Markers:** In the input, orange blocks appear as horizontal segments of three 7s (e.g., `7, 7, 7`) located within the black (0) rows. These markers indicate where a vertical connection should be formed.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule (The Bridge):**\n    For every block of `7, 7, 7` located at indices `c-1`, `c`, `c+1` in a row `r`:\n    *   **Horizontal Replacement:** The `7, 7, 7` sequence is replaced by `8, 6, 8`. This means:\n        *   `grid[r][c-1]` becomes 8 (Teal).\n        *   `grid[r][c]` becomes 6 (Magenta).\n        *   `grid[r][c+1]` becomes 8 (Teal).\n    *   **Vertical Extension:** The central magenta block (6) extends vertically to the rows immediately above and below it, creating a bridge between the solid teal bars.\n        *   `grid[r-1][c]` becomes 6.\n        *   `grid[r+1][c]` becomes 6.\n\n3.  **Green Edge Blocks (3):** The hint states that \"green edge blocks stay fixed.\" Although the examples show some movement of the green blocks, the hint is explicit. Therefore, for the test input, we will preserve the green '3's exactly as they appear in the input, unless they are overwritten by the vertical extension of a magenta bridge (which does not happen in the test case as the bridges are central and the 3s are at the edges).\n\n4.  **Static Elements:** The black horizontal bars (0s) and the teal horizontal bars (8s) remain unchanged, except where the transformation rule above applies.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Row 1:** `7, 7, 7` at indices 9, 10, 11. Center is 10.\n    *   Result: Row 1 becomes `...8, 6, 8...`. `grid[0][10]` and `grid[2][10]` become 6.\n*   **Row 3:** `7, 7, 7` at indices 12, 13, 14. Center is 13.\n    *   Result: Row 3 becomes `...8, 6, 8...`. `grid[2][13]` and `grid[4][13]` become 6.\n*   **Row 7:** `7, 7, 7` at indices 6, 7, 8. Center is 7.\n    *   Result: Row 7 becomes `...8, 6, 8...`. `grid[6][7]` and `grid[8][7]` become 6.\n*   **Row 9:** `7, 7, 7` at indices 3, 4, 5. Center is 4.\n    *   Result: Row 9 becomes `...8, 6, 8...`. `grid[8][4]` and `grid[10][4]` become 6.\n*   **Row 13:** `7, 7, 7` at indices 9, 10, 11.

top 3s removed; 33 only where above 0-row has near-edge triple; holed row8 retains single end-3s via the \u201c>=3-from-edge\u201d rule; bottom row gets single 3 on the long border segment and 3s adjacent to holes.\n- Observation: Matches official output patterns, including row8 having single end 3s and hole-adjacent 3; bottom row hole-adjacent 3s appear.\n- Verdict: Pass.\n\nExample 2:\n- Hypothesis: row2 gets left 33, row4 gets right 33, row8 gets both; bottom row gets single 3 at both ends.\n- Observation: Matches official output.\n- Verdict: Pass.\n\nResult: PASSED 2/2 examples.\n\nPHASE 3 \u2014 Test Output Consistency\n- Candidate 9 differs from Candidate 3 only on the bottom row: it outputs double 33 at both ends, justified by applying the \u201cnear-edge triple above \u21d2 double-3\u201d rule even to the bottom row.\n- This is internally consistent with its own crystallized rule.\n- Verdict: Consistent execution.\n\nNOTE ON AMBIGUITY\n- Training does NOT include a case where a near-edge triple sits directly above the bottom row, so whether the bottom row should show double-3 (Candidate 9) vs single-3 (Candidate 3) is underdetermined by ground truth.\n\n========================\nCANDIDATE 21\n========================\nPHASE 1 \u2014 Selection & Crystallization\n- Selected reasoning block: REASONING_MODEL_B (clearer: \u201ceverything else stays the same\u201d).\n\nCrystallized rule:\n1) Copy input.\n2) For each 777, replace with 868.\n3) Extend 6 vertically up/down through non-0 cells.\n4) Keep all existing 3 edge markers unchanged.\n\nPHASE 2 \u2014 Ground Truth Back-test\nExample 1:\n- Hypothesis: edge 3s remain where they were.\n- Observation: Official output removes top-row 3s and creates new 33 blocks and hole-adjacent 3s.\n- Verdict: Fail.\n\nExample 2:\n- Hypothesis: top row keeps edge 3s.\n- Observation: Official output top row has no 3s; multiple 33 blocks appear.\n- Verdict: Fail.\n\nResult: FAILED 2/2 examples.\n\nPHASE 3 \u2014 Test Output Consistency\n- Proposed test grid appears consistent with its own (incorrect) rule, but rule contradicts training.\n\n========================\nPHASE 4 \u2014 Stack Ranking\n- Candidate 3 vs 9: Both pass 2/2 training and are consistent on test. Tie-break is evidential conservatism: training bottom rows only show single 3 caps, never double-3 posts, so Candidate 3\u2019s bottom-row treatment is less extrapolative.\n- Candidate 21 is invalid.\n</AUDIT_LOG>",

Replace each horizontal triple `7,7,7` with `8,6,8` (same positions).\n\n2. **Project each segment center into adjacent beam rows**\n   - For each replaced triple, take its **center column** (the `6`).\n   -

On the **longer side**, change the cell immediately adjacent to the hole to `3` (only if that adjacent cell is `8`).\n   - (This is not done on the very top beam row in the examples; here the top beam has no hole anyway.)\n\n4. **Adjust beam end-caps (`3`)**\n   -

The task is to transform input grids to output grids, and I need to figure out the pattern.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\n*   **Background:** The input is a repeating pattern of teal (8) horizontal bars and black (0) spaces. The teal bars always have this \"3\" element at the start/end of a line, but its behavior in the output is, according to the hints, \"fixed\". We will see if the hint holds true to the test data.\n*   **Orange Markers:** There are orange markers, which are sets of three \"7\"s arranged horizontally. These trigger some kind of change.\n*   **Target:** The goal is to figure out how these orange '7's change to the output grid.\n*   **Hints:** The hints are \"The black horizontal-bar \u201cmaze\u201d and the green edge blocks stay fixed; the change is driven by the orange markers.\"\n\n**Hypotheses and Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Orange to Magenta (7 to 6) Transformation:** It looks like the orange \"7s\" are replaced by magenta \"6s\". A string of 3 7s will turn into a segment of a horizontal line of a string of 8,6,8. The magenta '6's seem to form a vertical bar that spans the height of the pattern.\n2.  **Magenta Propagation:** The output seems to have an upward and downward propagation of magenta '6' to the cells above and below the horizontal '6'.\n3.  **Black and Green Stability:** The black bars (0s) remain unchanged, as do the green \"3s\", according to the user.\n\n**Refining the Rule and Addressing Discrepancies:**\n\n*   **Verifying the \"Green\" Blocks:** I can see the \"3s\" (green) are NOT actually staying fixed in the examples! This is really confusing, but the hints for this specific use case, and to make it easier to start off the test case, states this should stay fixed. This hint is given for a reason for the test case, so I am going to hold onto it. If I don't, things get really complicated, really fast!\n*   **Refining the 7->6 Rule:** The core rule is: `7,7,7` becomes `8,6,8`. The \"6\" propagates one cell up and one cell down from where the middle `7` was.  The \"8\" replaces the 7.\n\n**Addressing the Strategy with \"Fixed 3s\":**\n\nSince the hint *specifically* mentions \"fixed green blocks,\" I'm going to follow this:\n\n1.  **Copy the Input.** Start by copying the entire input grid into the output.\n2.  **Apply the 7->6 Transformation.**\n    *   Find any sequence of `7,7,7` in the input.\n    *   Replace these cells with `8,6,8` horizontally.\n    *   Extend the '6' one row up and one row down by placing a '6' there.\n3.  **Keep 3s Fixed.** The 3s stay exactly where they are in the input.\n\n**Implementation Steps (Code):**\n\n1.  Parse the input grid into a data structure.\n2.  Find the `7,7,7` sequences (e.g., as lists of coordinates).\n3.  Create a copy of the input as the initial output.\n4.  Iterate over each `(r, c)` representing the *center* of the `7,7,7` sequence.\n    *   Modify `output[r][c-1] = 8`, `output[r][c] = 6`, `output[r][c+1] = 8`.\n    *   If valid, modify `output[r-1][c] = 6`, and `output[r+1][c] = 6`.\n5.  All other values, especially the '3's, remain unchanged.\n6.  Format the output grid.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nI will generate the output, apply the rules. I'll make sure there are no unintended collisions, and that the 3s are untouched (except when the transformation logic overwrites them, which shouldn't happen with the edges in this case).\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of colored numbers. Based on the solved examples and the specific hints provided, the transformation involves identifying orange markers (7s) in the input grid and converting them into magenta (6) and teal (8) structures that connect the horizontal teal (8) bars.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Orange Markers:** In the input, orange blocks appear as horizontal segments of three 7s (e.g., `7, 7, 7`) located within the black (0) rows. These markers indicate where a vertical connection should be formed.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule (The Bridge):**\n    For every block of `7, 7, 7` located at indices `c-1`, `c`, `c+1` in a row `r`:\n    *   **Horizontal Replacement:** The `7, 7, 7` sequence is replaced by `8, 6, 8`. This means:\n        *   `grid[r][c-1]` becomes 8 (Teal).\n        *   `grid[r][c]` becomes 6 (Magenta).\n        *   `grid[r][c+1]` becomes 8 (Teal).\n    *   **Vertical Extension:** The central magenta block (6) extends vertically to the rows immediately above and below it, creating a bridge between the solid teal bars.\n        *   `grid[r-1][c]` becomes 6.\n        *   `grid[r+1][c]` becomes 6.\n\n3.  **Green Edge Blocks (3):** The hint states that \"green edge blocks stay fixed.\" Although the examples show some movement of the green blocks, the hint is explicit. Therefore, for the test input, we will preserve the green '3's exactly as they appear in the input, unless they are overwritten by the vertical extension of a magenta bridge (which does not happen in the test case as the bridges are central and the 3s are at the edges).\n\n4.  **Static Elements:** The black horizontal bars (0s) and the teal horizontal bars (8s) remain unchanged, except where the transformation rule above applies.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Row 1:** `7, 7, 7` at indices 9, 10, 11. Center is 10.\n    *   Result: Row 1 becomes `...8, 6, 8...`. `grid[0][10]` and `grid[2][10]` become 6.\n*   **Row 3:** `7, 7, 7` at indices 12, 13, 14. Center is 13.\n    *   Result: Row 3 becomes `...8, 6, 8...`. `grid[2][13]` and `grid[4][13]` become 6.\n*   **Row 7:** `7, 7, 7` at indices 6, 7, 8. Center is 7.\n    *   Result: Row 7 becomes `...8, 6, 8...`. `grid[6][7]` and `grid[8][7]` become 6.\n*   **Row 9:** `7, 7, 7` at indices 3, 4, 5. Center is 4.\n    *   Result: Row 9 becomes `...8, 6, 8...`. `grid[8][4]` and `grid[10][4]` become 6.\n*   **Row 13:** `7, 7, 7` at indices 9, 10, 11.

It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
