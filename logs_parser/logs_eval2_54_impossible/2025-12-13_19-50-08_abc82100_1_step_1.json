        "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, let's break down this ARC problem. The task is to take an input grid, usually a small pattern or an image, and produce a transformed output grid, based on some hidden rules that need to be extracted from a few examples.**\n\nI'm seeing a general structure: a key or a \"legend\" within the input image itself that acts as the rulebook. In the first example, it's just a horizontal line of numbers: the legend which tells me, for instance,  that one colour (say '1') becomes another ('2'). Often, these keys are \"delimited\" by a \"wall\" or separator, often an '8', but it also might define the starting point of a \"Canvas.\"\n\nThe key element seems to be about the colour transformation rule: \"Color A becomes Color B.\" This often also includes some kind of \"spread\", a pattern defined by the positioning of A and B in the key. When there is a \"color\" pair next to each other in the rule, like '1 2,' a new colour (like '2') appears to the side of the original position; if they are not next to each other, like '2 1,' maybe it's just the horizontal spread, maybe it is a more general \"change.\"\n\nThere are regions within the grid, with specific \"codes\" that seem to determine these patterns. My thinking is, \"Is there a rule or code to apply to this specific region?\". In Ex 1 the `1 2` means one color replaces another (plus a spread from the placement of the B element to its relative position in the rule) and makes new patterns based on the rules. Example 2's `6 7`  is \"Replace\" and adds to the offset, vertically. Sometimes these patterns are just \"Swaps\".\n\nMore difficult cases appear and it is hard to guess the specific logic until I have to use more than one of the samples, but now the idea is to look at adjacent pairs of colors and see if any rule is triggered by that structure. The 8s appear to be delimiters that frame or bound a rule.\n\nThere's this pattern of \"Spread\" or \"Fill\", using one or two values. So I need to keep looking at patterns in the Input to Output pairs, and notice if values appear on edges or inside shapes.\n\nThere seem to be different categories of grid elements. The values used in a rule are part of a very specific code. Other codes and parts of shapes are to be ignored or transformed according to that rule.\n\nWhen a region is defined by a \"context\" of a rule, and a legend pair is discovered, such as `4 2` or `1 2`, then the \"4\" in this context is transformed in a certain way, like a swap or an insertion of the target next to the source. The \"8\" values form a boundary of a shape in the grid.\nI need to examine the data (colours, numbers) and the structure, and identify these rules, and then to apply them to produce the new grids.\n\nNow, I need to come up with an approach for the actual TEST INPUT. The goal is to look at a small part of the image, find the rules, and make the transformation using those rules.\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we need to understand the relationship between the \"Key\" or \"Legend\" structures provided in the input grid and the transformations applied to the rest of the grid pixels.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Rule Identification:**\n    *   In all examples, there are specific rows or sections that act as a \"Legend\". These are typically sequences of colored pixels ending with an `8` or bounded by `8`s.\n    *   The Legend defines a transformation `A -> B` based on adjacent pairs.\n    *   **Example 1:** Row 0 contains `1, 2, 8, 8, 8`. The adjacent pair is `1, 2`. This defines a rule: **Replace color 1 with color 2**.\n    *   **Example 2:** Row 10 contains `8, 0, 4, 2, ...`. Pair `4, 2` (or `2, 4` symmetric/swap). Row 8/9 contains vertical pair `7` over `6`. This defines **6 -> 7**.\n    *   **Example 4:** Vertical column contains `2` over `1`. Rule: **2 -> 1**. Row 0 contains `1` then `2`. Rule: **1 -> 2**.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic (Spread/Fill):**\n    *   The transformation is not just a color swap. It involves a \"spread\" or \"copy\" operation based on the spatial relationship in the Legend.\n    *   **Rule:** If the Legend has color `A` at position `P` and color `B` at position `P + Vector`, then for every pixel of color `A` in the grid:\n        *   Change the pixel at `(r, c)` to color `B`.\n        *   Also place a pixel of color `B` at `(r, c) + Vector`.\n    *   **Example 1:** `1, 2` are horizontal neighbors (Vector `(0, +1)`). Input 1s become two horizontal 2s (`2, 2`).\n    *   **Example 2:** `7` is above `6` (Vector `(-1, 0)` from 6 to 7). Input 6s become a 7 at original pos and a 7 at the row above.\n    *   **Example 4:** `2` is above `1` (Vector `(+1, 0)` from 2 to 1). Input vertical 2s become 1s at original pos and 1s at row below (creating a solid line).\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Legends found:**\n        *   Row 2: `0, 4, 1, 8`. Pair `4, 1`. Vector `(0, +1)`. Rule: **4 -> 1** with right spread.\n        *   Row 6: `0, 2, 4, 8`. Pair `2, 4`. Vector `(0, +1)`. Rule: **2 -> 4** with right spread.\n        *   Row 10: `0, 5, 7, 8`. Pair `5, 7`. Vector `(0, +1)`. Rule: **5 -> 7** with right spread.\n    *   **Processing:**\n        *   Identify pixels of colors 4, 2, and 5 in the grid (excluding the legend rows themselves).\n        *   Apply the transformations:\n            *   Pixel `4` at `(r, c)` becomes `1` at `(r, c)` and `1` at `(r, c+1)`.\n            *   Pixel `2` at `(r, c)` becomes `4` at `(r, c)` and `4` at `(r, c+1)`.\n            *   Pixel `5` at `(r, c)` becomes `7` at `(r, c)` and `7` at `(r, c+1)`.\n        *   Pixels of color `6` have no corresponding rule and are preserved.\n        *   Pixels of color `8` act as delimiters/walls and are removed (become `0`).\n        *   The Legend rows (2, 6, 10) are \"instruction code\" and are cleared (become `0`).\n\n**Detailed Transformation for Test Input:**\n*   Row 0: `(0,17)` is 6. -> `6`.\n*   Row 1: `(1,0)` is 2. -> `4, 4` at `(1,0), (1,1)`. `(1,3)` is 8 -> `0`. `(1,7)` is 6 -> `6`. `(1,19)` is 6 -> `6`.\n*   Row 2: Legend -> All `0`.\n*   Row 3: `(3,13)` is 5. -> `7, 7` at `(3,13), (3,14)`.\n*   Row 5: `(5,17)` is 4. -> `1, 1` at `(5,17), (5,18)`.\n*   Row 6: Legend -> All `0`.\n*   Row 8: `(8,6)` is 2. -> `4, 4` at `(8,6), (8,7)`. `(8,18)` is 5 -> `7, 7` at `(8,18), (8,19)`.\n*   Row 10: Legend -> All `0`.\n*   Row 12: `(12,16)` is 2. -> `4, 4` at `(12,16), (12,17)`.\n*   Row 14: `(14,1)` is 2 -> `4, 4`. `(14,5)` is 2 -> `4, 4`. `(14,13)` is 2 -> `4, 4`. `(14,19)` is 6 -> `6`.\n*   Row 15: `(15,9)` is 4 (from input col 13 actually?

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process on this ARC task. The user has given me some examples, and I'm supposed to figure out the pattern.\n\nFirst, I looked at example 1, seeing a grid with some colored pixels and an \"8\" that kept popping up. I tried to find structures in how the colors were arranged. It wasn't clear, but I noticed there was a line of these \"8\" pixels, which seemed important, and also some other colored pixels that weren't a part of the line.\n\nThen I checked example 4, because it looked simpler. Here I saw color lines swapping, but it also made me notice that there was a line that I assumed was an \"8\". When I looked at this closer, I saw that the \"8\" line had an associated color. This example had me thinking that there was some sort of a color swap happening, or perhaps there was a wire or a marker indicating where the change would take place.\n\nI went back to example 3, which was much bigger. I saw again that there was a repeating \"8\" color with pixels that were next to it. Also, there seemed to be a shape. I noticed there were other pixels near the \"8\" and then also some \"single\" pixels that I considered to be \"markers\". I thought maybe the colors were being swapped or transformed somehow, and the \"8\" structure was the key. Then I found an isolated pixel.\n\nAfter looking at example 2, I had to stop and rethink. I thought that the \"8\" might be used for wires, that connect a source object and a target object. Then I thought that the color on each of these objects, was swapped depending on how it was attached. This was looking promising.\n\nI then went back to example 4 and reevaluated the \"wire\" idea. I saw that there were two colors, which were then swapped and this made me think that it could be a colour swap between two connected regions. So I went back and applied the Color Swap hypothesis to example 1 to see if that helped. I realized the \u201c8\u201d pixels can be considered a wire.\nI thought that there were shape structures that were transformed in color based on the color value of other pixels in the grid.\n\nThen I considered the Test Input, since I needed to solve it. I focused on tracing the \"8s\" to see what was connected to them. This led me to identify these \"clusters\" of colors, I saw that there was a color change associated. Then I went back to example 4, which had only direct contact and then colors were swapped. So I realized there can be direct-contact color swapping.\n\nThen I created a hypothesis:\n1.  **Identify valid \"assemblies\" and transform them. Discard everything else.**\n2.  A valid assembly involves a Connector (8) or direct contact.\n3.  Connector (8) acts as a Hub. If no connectors, then adjacency is used.\n4.  Identify control pixels and target regions.\n    *Control pixels can be identified as a single color or group that does not belong to main structure. Target regions are defined by a specific color.\n5.  Based on the wire, the Target receives the color of the Control pixel.\n\nI then did the test input with this approach. I identified the 8s. Then I looked at the attached items on the left side of the 8 and then saw if there was an aligned \"Source\" object. Then I swapped the color of the left with the color on the right.\n\nThe pattern now seems to be that a \"control\" pixel, connected (via \"8\" wire or direct adjacency) with a group of pixels, causes a color propagation.\n\nIn this Test Input case, there are only three assemblies. So I calculated the right answer, making sure to remove the pixels that don't belong to any group.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the test input grid based on the logic inferred from the provided examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** A \"Target\" structure of 1s (Blue) is transformed into 2s (Red). The color 2 comes from a single \"Source\" pixel separated from the Target by a line of 8s (Azure). The 8s and the original Source pixel are removed. The Target shape is filled/completed in the process.\n2.  **Example 3:** Two distinct structures.\n    *   Top: A Target structure of 4s (Yellow) connected via a network of 8s (Azure) to a single Source pixel of 2 (Red). Result: The Target structure becomes 2s.\n    *   Bottom: A Target structure of 1s (Blue) connected via 8s to a single Source pixel of 7 (Orange). Result: The Target structure becomes 7s.\n    *   The 8s and original Source pixels are removed.\n3.  **Example 4:** Two adjacent structures (Line of 1s, Line of 2s) swap colors. No 8s involved in the main interaction. Unconnected noise is removed.\n4.  **Example 2:** Complex, but follows the pattern of connected components changing color.\n\n**General Rule:**\n*   **Components:** Look for \"Target Clusters\" (groups of non-black pixels) and \"Source Pixels\" (typically single pixels).\n*   **Connection:** These are connected by a \"Wire\" or \"Frame\" of color 8 (Azure). The connection can be direct adjacency or alignment along the same row/column through the 8-structure.\n*   **Transformation:** The Target Cluster takes the color of the Source Pixel. The geometry of the Target Cluster is preserved (and potentially filled, though in the test case the clusters are simple rectangles).\n*   **Cleanup:** The Wire (8s), the original Source Pixel, and any unconnected/noise pixels are removed (become 0).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe Test Input is a 20x20 grid. We identify the relevant structures:\n\n1.  **The Wire:** There is a vertical arrangement of 8s in columns 3 and 4 (and scattered nearby).\n2.  **Potential Assemblies (Target + Wire + Source):** We check for rows containing 8s, a cluster on the left (Target), and a single pixel on the right (Source).\n\n*   **Row 2:**\n    *   **Wire:** 8 at (2,3).\n    *   **Target (Left):** Pixels at (2,1) [Color 4] and (2,2) [Color 1]. They are adjacent to the 8.\n    *   **Source (Right):** Pixel at (2,10) [Color 1]. It is aligned with the 8.\n    *   **Action:** The Target Cluster {(2,1), (2,2)} changes to the Source color (1). The Source and Wire are removed.\n    *   **Result:** Pixels at (2,1) and (2,2) become **1**.\n\n*   **Row 6:**\n    *   **Wire:** 8 at (6,3) (and (6,5)).\n    *   **Target (Left):** Pixels at (6,1) [Color 2] and (6,2) [Color 4]. Adjacent to the 8.\n    *   **Source (Right):** Pixel at (6,11) [Color 2]. Aligned with the 8s.\n    *   **Action:** The Target Cluster {(6,1), (6,2)} changes to the Source color (2).\n    *   **Result:** Pixels at (6,1) and (6,2) become **2**.\n\n*   **Row 10:**\n    *   **Wire:** 8 at (10,3) (and (10,4)).\n    *   **Target (Left):** Pixels at (10,1) [Color 5] and (10,2) [Color 7]. Adjacent to the 8.\n    *   **Source (Right):** Pixel at (10,9) [Color 5]. Aligned with the 8s.\n    *   **Action:** The Target Cluster {(10,1), (10,2)} changes to the Source color (5).\n    *   **Result:** Pixels at (10,1) and (10,2) become **5**.\n\n*   **Other Rows:**\n    *   Row 1: 8 at (1,3), Source 6 at (1,19), but no Target attached on the left (Pixel at (1,0) is not adjacent to 8).\n    *   Row 9: 8 at (9,4), Source 4 at (9,13), but no Target on the left.\n    *   Rows with no 8s (e.g., 14, 17, 19): Considered noise/unconnected.\n    *   These are all removed.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nThe output grid is all 0s, except for the transformed target clusters:\n*   (2,1) = 1, (2,2) = 1\n*   (6,1) = 2, (6,2) = 2\n*   (10,1) = 5, (10,2) = 5\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern.\n\n**Analysis of the examples:**\n\n1. **Color 8 marks a \"key\" area** - 8s form shapes (lines, diamonds) that define the transformation region.\n\n2. **Adjacent colors define transformation rules** - Colors immediately adjacent to the 8s (typically in columns 1-2 near the 8 pattern) come in pairs that define color mappings.\n\n3. **Transformation chain**:\n   - In Example 1: (1,2) pair \u2192 1 becomes 2\n   - In Example 4: 1\u21942 swap\n   - In Example 3: 4\u21922 and 1\u21927\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nThe 8s form a vertical shape at columns 3-5, rows 1-11.\n\nAdjacent color pairs (at columns 1-2):\n- Row 2: (4, 1) \u2192 4 becomes 1\n- Row 6: (2, 4) \u2192 2 becomes 4  \n- Row 10: (5, 7) \u2192 5 becomes 7\n\nThis creates a transformation chain: **2\u21924\u21921** and **5\u21927**\n\n**Applying transformations:**\n1. Remove all 8s and the defining pair cells\n2. Transform colors outside the key area:\n   - All 2s \u2192 4 \u2192 1 (final result: 1)\n   - All 4s \u2192 1\n   - All 5s \u2192 7\n   - 6s remain unchanged\n   - Original 1s outside defining pairs remain as 1s\n\n**Constructing the output:**\n\nAfter removing 8s and defining pairs, and applying transformations:\n- 6s stay at: (0,17), (1,7), (1,19), (14,19), (17,16), (19,9)\n- 1s appear at transformed positions from 2s and 4s, plus original 1s\n- 7s appear at transformed positions from 5s\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

Treat it as \u201cnoise\u201d and convert it to background (`0`) conceptually.\n\n2. **Find a \u201csignal\u201d color that appears exactly once (a singleton)**  \n   In the examples where the output uses mainly one or two colors, those output colors come from singleton \u201csignal\u201d pixels:\n   - Example 1: singleton `2` drives the output.\n   - Example 3: singleton `2` and singleton `7` drive the output.\n\n3. **Pair the singleton with its orthogonally-adjacent nonzero neighbor**  \n   The singleton indicates which other color\u2019s structure it will \u201crepaint/convert\u201d.  \n   (Example 3 has `2` adjacent to a `4`, and `7` adjacent to a `1`, and those larger-color structures become colors `2` and `7` in output.)\n\n4. **Use the paired (non-singleton) color\u2019s strongest line as the seed, then \u201ccast\u201d it to the nearest border and expand diagonally**\n   - Find the row (or column) where that paired color is most concentrated.\n   - Move (\u201ctranslate\u201d) that row to the nearest border (top/bottom).\n   - Let the shift distance be `d`. From each translated seed cell, draw the two diagonals back inward for `d` steps (forming a V/triangle fan).  \n   - Everything is colored with the singleton\u2019s color; all other cells are `0`.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n- The only singleton non-noise color is `7` (it occurs once at row 11, col 3).\n- That `7` is orthogonally adjacent to a `5` (row 11, col 2), so **`7` is the paint color** and **`5` is the structure color**.\n- The densest row for color `5` is **row 11** (it contains two 5s: at columns 2 and 10).\n- Row 11 is closer to the **bottom** than the top (distance to bottom is `20-11=9`), so shift that seed row down by `9` to **row 20**.\n- From the two seed points now at (20,2) and (20,10), draw diagonals upward for `9` steps, placing color `7`.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0  \n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0  \n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",
