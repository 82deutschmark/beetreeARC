model_id=\"gemini-3-high_1_step_1\">\n**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, the user wants me to solve an ARC task, likely involving some sort of pattern recognition and rule application. I need to analyze a set of solved examples (4) and a single test case to figure out the underlying logic. My initial thought is to break down the task into smaller sub-problems. First, I\u2019ll look at the examples and try to identify repeating structures, patterns, and relationships between the inputs and outputs. I'll pay close attention to any visual cues like colors, shapes, and spatial arrangements. Then, I\u2019ll formalize the rules and test them against the solved cases before applying them to the new test input.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nThis looks promising. I see a 24x24 grid, with some background color (8, teal). There are a few interesting structures here: small boxes. Let's look at the first box: Rows 9-12, Col 3-6.  It has a border (green, 3) and an inner color (maroon, 9). I'll note those coordinates.  The other boxes seem similar (green border with an interior color, different positions/colors). Let's see, there is also a Box with (blue, 1), and then a box (yellow, 4).  I'll compare the input boxes and see what the output is. Ah, the output. I see diagonal lines emanating from these boxes! Not always from the boxes, but radiating outwards. Let\u2019s try to identify how these \"rays\" are generated, I see some sort of diagonal pattern emerging, I will check the position of the box and compare with the output.  The original boxes are still visible but some pixels are replaced with rays. The pixels around the box have been changed! So, the border is there. This is a crucial observation.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s get a little more specific with coordinates, let\u2019s see the maroon (9), the original box pixels are at (10,4), (10,5), (11,4), (11,5). Let\u2019s compare with the output. Hmm, the output 9s appear in diagonal lines. This suggests a direction and distance relationship.  Let\u2019s trace the diagonal lines and compare their coordinate's,  this is probably important. Let's look for a pattern in the distances. Going back to my drawing board.\n\nOkay, it seems like the rays are based on the inner colors, not the outer border.  For this specific case, the inner color (9) is \"projected\" out diagonally in two directions to create the visual rays.  It seems to be filling the background. Ah, the green borders aren\u2019t there, the boxes themselves are still visible, but the background around them has been transformed into a diagonal pattern. Let me check the next one, looking at the blue one (1),  In the output, I\u2019m seeing vertical lines of 1s instead of diagonals. So, each box seems to generate a unique ray pattern! And, it appears the 3s (green) are somewhat irrelevant now. It looks like the rays go from those boxes and stop at a vertical line! This might be a rule.\n\nAh, I think I'm starting to get it. The direction is related to the hole in the border. Let's check the Yellow one (4) and see where the pattern changes in the output to confirm my hypothesis. Here, I see the Yellow one is projected up, but shifts, with the exception of the Magenta, the shift isn't completely vertical, it seems it shifted one step and the output is just a vertical line. Let me keep analyzing the hole and the border.  The output seems to change, is the board an influence? Let's check Ex 1 and confirm, the pattern changes to up vertical at the column 18 and a 3 by side-by-side! The box color influences the shape!\n\n**Formulation of Hypothesis & Rules:**\n\nI\u2019ve got a theory! The \u201cgreen\u201d border acts as a launcher or cannon for \"rays\" of the inner color. The \"missing\" green pixels in the 3x3 box determines the direction. So, corners shoot diagonals.  The \"missing\" ones on the sides, shoot straights! I am pretty sure this is the right direction!\n\n*   Closed Border: No ray or undefined shape!\n*   Missing corner creates a diagonal ray from that corner.\n*   Missing side creates a straight ray.\n\nLet me verify this, with those new hypothesis. I\u2019m starting with the maroon example (9). The corners are missing, the output reflects diagonal projections!  For the blue box, the corners are also missing, and the rays are also diagonals (X-shaped). The yellow one (4) has top and bottom\n\nThe solution involves simulating \"light rays\" emitted from colored boxes.\n\n**Logic:**\n1.  **Sources:** The grid contains several rectangular structures (boxes) defined by green (3) borders. Each box encloses a specific inner color.\n2.  **Emitters:** The green border is not always continuous. \"Holes\" (pixels in the 4x4 perimeter that are not 3, usually 8) act as emitters.\n    -   **Top/Bottom/Left/Right Edge Holes:** Emit straight rays (Vertical/Horizontal) outwards from the hole.\n    -   **Corner Holes:** Emit diagonal rays (45 degrees) outwards from the corner.\n3.  **Beam Color:** The rays consist of the color found inside the box.\n4.  **Interactions:**\n    -   **Solid Objects:** Rays are blocked by the green borders of other boxes.\n    -   **Ray Collisions:**\n        -   **Perpendicular/Crossing:** If a Horizontal ray hits a Vertical ray, the Horizontal ray typically stops (Vertical/Diagonal blocks Horizontal).\n        -   **Diagonal vs Vertical:** If a Diagonal ray intersects a Vertical ray, the Vertical ray is \"pushed\" or shifted sideways to run parallel to the diagonal ray.\n        -   **Diagonal vs Horizontal:** The Diagonal ray blocks the Horizontal ray.\n\n**Rays in Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Red Box (Inner 2):**\n    -   Hole at Top (4,4) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Up (Col 4).\n    -   Hole at Left (5,3) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Left (Row 5).\n    -   Hole at Bottom-Right (7,6) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal BR.\n\n2.  **Yellow Box (Inner 4):**\n    -   Hole at Top-Right (4,18) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal UR.\n    -   Hole at Right (5,18) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Right (Row 5). *Interaction:* Intersection with Magenta Up Ray at Col 23. Horizontal stops. Ray ends at Col 22.\n    -   Hole at Bottom (7,16) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Down (Col 16). *Interaction:* Intersection with Red BR Diagonal Ray at Row 17. The Vertical ray is pushed right by the Diagonal ray. From Row 17 onwards, it shifts to `(r, r)` path (Col = Row).\n\n3.  **Magenta Box (Inner 6):**\n    -   Hole at Top (13,23) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Up (Col 23).\n    -   Hole at Top-Right (13,25) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal UR.\n    -   Hole at Bottom-Right (16,25) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal BR.\n\n4.  **Orange Box (Inner 7):**\n    -   Hole at Right (20,24) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Right (Row 20). *Interaction:* Intersection with Magenta BR Diagonal Ray at Col 29. Horizontal stops at 28.\n    -   Hole at Bottom-Right (22,24) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal BR.\n\n5.  **Maroon Box (Inner 9):**\n    -   Hole at Top (24,3) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Up (Col 3). *Interaction:* Blocked by the bottom of the Red Box at Row 7 (specifically Row 7 Col 3 is a 3). Ray stops at Row 8.\n    -   Hole at Right (25,4) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Right (Row 25). *Interaction:* Intersection with Red BR Diagonal Ray at Col 24. Horizontal stops at 23.\n    -   Hole at Right (26,4) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Right (Row 26). *Interaction:* Intersection with Red BR Diagonal Ray at Col 25. Horizontal stops at 24.\n    -   Hole at Bottom-Right (27,4) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal BR.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,2,4,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 0>\n<CANDIDATE 1>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n889828888888888888888486888888\n889828888888888888884886888888\n889828888888888888848886888888\n889828888888888888488886888888\n889323388888883334888888888888\n222222388888883444444444444444\n889322388888883443888888888888\n889333288888883433888888888888\n889888828888888488888888888888\n889888882888888488888888888886\n889888888288888488888888888868\n889888888828888488888888888688\n889888888882888488888886886888\n889888888888288488888836368888\n889888888888828488888836638888\n889888888888882488888836638888\n889888888888888488888833368888\n889888888888888428888888886888\n889888888888888482888888888688\n889888888888888488288333388868\n889888888888888488828377777776\n889888888888888488882377388888\n889888888888888488888233788888\n889888888888888488888828878888\n339388888888888488888882887888\n399388888888888488888888288788\n399388888888888488888888828878\n333988888888888488888888882887\n888898888888888488888888888288\n888889888888888488888888888828\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_2_step_1\">\n**Analysis and Solution for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given examples and a test input. My job is to figure out the rule and apply it. Let's break this down.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\n*   I'm looking at grids, mainly filled with one color (like blue in the first example), with some small, organized structures embedded within them. These structures are the key.\n*   They seem to be a specific color with a green border. But the border isn't a perfect square. This is important.\n*   The output grids show diagonal lines or \"rays\" originating from these structures, with the color of the inner part of the structure.\n\n**Diving into the Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1**: The first thing I see are these structures with a green, slightly irregular border. Inside, there's a 2x2 block of a different color. My gut tells me these are \"pods\" of some kind.\n    *   I carefully examine the border shape. It looks like a square with the corners removed, which I'll call a \"damaged\" border or broken box.\n    *   The output has lines of the inner color (e.g. 9) extending out diagonally from the pods. The lines seem to follow these directions:\n        *   Each corner of each pod border is a hole.\n\n*   **Example 2**: I'm on the right track, with a smaller grid and only one pod.\n    *   There's also this damaged border with a hole (missing green).\n    *   The output shows a diagonal line, and it's starting where there is a broken border!\n        *   This seems to reinforce the idea that the direction of the lines in the output relates to the shape of the border.\n    *   A bit of further observation about the output indicates that the lines might be related to which parts of the pod is \"missing\" (not 3), and \"rays\" get launched from there, like lights from a lighthouse! The rays' directions change according to the \"missing\" border segments.\n\n*   **Hypothesis Formulation:** I'm starting to get a clear picture. Here's my working hypothesis:\n    1.  **Identify Pods:** Find a 2x2 core of a certain color ($C_{core}$) surrounded by a damaged green border (3).\n    2.  **Hole Detection:** Examine the border. The border should have a full square shape, with all the sides, except for those that have 8 or a similar non-3 value, which defines a *hole*.\n    3.  **Ray Launch:** For each hole, project a line of the inner color $C_{core}$ outwards in a specific direction determined by the position of the hole in the bounding box. Corners move diagonally.\n\n*   I'm testing this hypothesis carefully with Example 2, checking each part of the border. I see the pattern. It's the holes, which act like launch points for rays.\n    *   When the border is broken, with a pixel that is not 3, that defines a direction for the ray.\n\n**Refining the Rule:**\n\n*   I see a difference between a pod, versus a \"damaged\" border.\n    *   A perfect box boundary has corners, and these don't lead to lines, since they are not considered holes.\n\n*   I need a formal definition of a \"hole\" or \"damaged\" position:\n    *   Scan the 4x4 bounding box around the 2x2 core.\n    *   Any boundary pixel that is not a 3 is a *hole*.\n    *   For corner pixels that are non-3, diagonal lines get emitted from that location.\n*   I check my rule against the examples again to confirm. This is making sense!\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Pod Identification:** I'll scan the test input grid and look for 2x2 blocks of colors that aren't 3 or 8. These are my cores.\n2.  **Boundary & Hole Detection:** I draw the 4x4 bounding box around each core, then I'll find all the non-3 values within that border, which defines the hole.\n3.  **Ray Generation:** For each hole, the location defines the start of a ray.\n\nI'm systematically going through the test input:\n\n*   I identify five pods.\n*   For each pod, I carefully analyze the borders, identifying the positions of all the 3's and the non-3's. Non-3's means hole.\n*   The position defines the direction of the ray.\n\n**Conflict Resolution:**\n\n*   What happens when rays cross or overlap\n\nThe transformation involves identifying \"pods\" in the grid and projecting colored lines from them.\n\n**Rules inferred from examples:**\n1.  **Identify Pods:** Look for 4x4 structures that consist of a border of green (3) pixels surrounding a 2x2 core of a distinct color $C$. The border occupies the perimeter of the 4x4 area.\n2.  **Identify Holes:** Examine the 12-pixel border of each 4x4 pod. A \"Hole\" is any pixel in this border that is **not** green (3). In the examples, holes are typically background color (8) or sometimes the core color if the pod is \"damaged\".\n3.  **Project Rays:** For each Hole found:\n    *   Determine the direction of the ray based on the Hole's position relative to the pod's center:\n        *   **Top Edge (non-corner):** Project **Up** (Vertical).\n        *   **Bottom Edge (non-corner):** Project **Down** (Vertical).\n        *   **Left Edge (non-corner):** Project **Left** (Horizontal).\n        *   **Right Edge (non-corner):** Project **Right** (Horizontal).\n        *   **Top-Left Corner:** Project **Up-Left** (Diagonal).\n        *   **Top-Right Corner:** Project **Up-Right** (Diagonal).\n        *   **Bottom-Left Corner:** Project **Down-Left** (Diagonal).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner:** Project **Down-Right** (Diagonal).\n    *   The ray consists of the core color $C$.\n    *   The ray starts at the Hole pixel itself (replacing it with $C$) and continues in the determined direction until it hits the grid edge.\n4.  **Collision Resolution:** If rays from different pods overlap at the same pixel:\n    *   The ray with the **shorter distance to its source** (the hole) takes precedence (Closer wins).\n    *   If distances are equal, a consistent tie-breaking rule applies (in this solution, Vertical lines or Reading Order of the pod seems to take precedence).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nWe identified 5 pods:\n1.  **Pod A (Yellow 4):** Rows 4-7, Cols 14-17.\n    *   Hole at (4,17) [TR] $\\to$ Ray Up-Right.\n    *   Hole at (5,17) [R] $\\to$ Ray Right.\n    *   Hole at (7,15) [B] $\\to$ Ray Down.\n2.  **Pod B (Red 2):** Rows 4-7, Cols 3-6.\n    *   Hole at (4,4) [T] $\\to$ Ray Up.\n    *   Hole at (5,3) [L] $\\to$ Ray Left.\n    *   Hole at (7,6) [BR] $\\to$ Ray Down-Right.\n3.  **Pod C (Pink 6):** Rows 13-16, Cols 22-25.\n    *   Hole at (13,23) [T] $\\to$ Ray Up.\n    *   Hole at (13,25) [TR] $\\to$ Ray Up-Right.\n    *   Hole at (16,25) [BR] $\\to$ Ray Down-Right.\n4.  **Pod D (Orange 7):** Rows 19-22, Cols 21-24.\n    *   Hole at (20,24) [R] $\\to$ Ray Right.\n    *   Hole at (22,24) [BR] $\\to$ Ray Down-Right.\n5.  **Pod E (Maroon 9):** Rows 24-27, Cols 0-3.\n    *   Hole at (24,2) [T] $\\to$ Ray Up.\n    *   Hole at (27,3) [BR] $\\to$ Ray Down-Right.\n\n**Notable Conflicts:**\n*   At `(5,2)`: Ray B (Left, dist 1) vs Ray E (Up, dist 19). Ray B wins (Color 2).\n*   At `(16,15)`: Ray A (Down, dist 9) vs Ray B (Down-Right, dist 9). Ray A wins (Color 4).\n*   At `(20,29)`: Ray C (Down-Right, dist 4) vs Ray D (Right, dist 5). Ray C wins (Color 6).\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 1>\n<CANDIDATE 2>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n889828888848888888888886888888\n889828888884888888888886888888\n889828888888488888888886888888\n889828888888848888888886888888\n889323388888884333888886888888\n222222388888883444444446444444\n889322388888883443888886888888\n889333288888883433888886888888\n889888828888888488888886888888\n889888882888888488888886888886\n889888888288888488888886888868\n889888888828888488888886888688\n889888888882888488888886886888\n889888888888288488888836368888\n889888888888828488888836638888\n889888888888882488888836638888\n889888888888888428888833368888\n889888888888888482888888886888\n889888888888888488288888888688\n889888888888888488828333388868\n889888888888888488882377777777\n889888888888888488888377388888\n889888888888888488888333788888\n889888888888888488888888878888\n339388888888888488888888887888\n399388888888888488888888888788\n399388888888888488888888888878\n333988888888888488888888888887\n889898888888888488888888888888\n889889888888888488888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. Each example contains rectangular patterns outlined by 3s (borders) with colored 2x2 interiors\n2. Some border positions have gaps (8s instead of 3s)\n3. From each gap, a line extends in the direction away from the pattern's center:\n   - Edge gaps: horizontal/vertical lines\n   - Corner gaps: diagonal lines\n4. The line color matches the interior color of that pattern\n\nFor the test input, I identify these patterns and their gaps:\n- **2s pattern** (rows 4-7, cols 3-6): gaps at (4,4)\u2192up, (5,3)\u2192left, (7,6)\u2192diagonal down-right\n- **4s pattern** (rows 4-7, cols 14-17): gaps at (4,14)\u2192diagonal up-left, (5,17)\u2192right, (7,15)\u2192down\n- **6s pattern** (rows 13-16, cols 22-25): gaps at (13,23)\u2192up, (13,25)\u2192diagonal up-right, (16,25)\u2192diagonal down-right\n- **7s pattern** (rows 19-22, cols 21-24): gaps at (20,24)\u2192right, (22,24)\u2192diagonal down-right\n- **9s pattern** (rows 24-27, cols 0-3): gaps at (24,2)\u2192up, (27,3)\u2192diagonal down-right\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 2>\n<CANDIDATE 3>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n289828888848888888888846889888\n829828888884888888888486898888\n282828888888488888884886988888\n829228888888848888848886888888\n882323388888884333488896888888\n222222388888883444444444444444\n889322388888883443889888888888\n889333288888883433898886888888\n889888829888884488688886888888\n889888882888848489868886888886\n889888888288488498886886888868\n889888888824888488888686888688\n889888888842889488888866886888\n889888888488298488888836368888\n889888884888928488888836638888\n889888848889882488888836638887\n889888488898888288888833368878\n889884888988888428888888886788\n889848889888888482888888887688\n889488898888888488288333378868\n884888988888888488828377777776\n849889888888888488882377388888\n489898888888888488888333788888\n889988888888888488888888878888\n339388888888888488888888887888\n399388888888888488888888888788\n399388888888888488888888888878\n333988888888888488888888888887\n888898888888888488888888888888\n888889888888888488888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_1_step_1\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n- **Background color** is `8`.\n- **Wall/stop color** is `3` (these pixels act like barriers and are never changed).\n- All other colors (`1,2,4,6,7,9` in the examples) are **source colors**.\n\n**For every source-colored cell** (a cell whose value is not `8` and not `3`):\n\n1.

The ray stops if it goes out of bounds or hits a wall `3`.  \n   (Existing non-background cells are not overwritten.)\n\nApplying this to all sources produces the output.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n2,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,9,8,8,8\n8,2,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,9,8,8,8,8\n2,8,2,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,9,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,9,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,4,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,9,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,7,8\n8,8,9,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8\n8,8,9,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8\n8,8,9,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,7,8,8,6,8\n8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,4,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 3>\n<CANDIDATE 4>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n888828888848888888888888888486\n888828888884888888888888884868\n288828888888488888888888848688\n828828888888848888888888486888\n982323388888884333888884868888\n898222388888883444444448688888\n889322388888883443888886888888\n889333888888883433888886888888\n889888888888888488888886888888\n889888888888888488888886888886\n889888888888888488888886888868\n889888888888888488888886888688\n889888888888888488888886886888\n889888888888888488888836368888\n889888888888888488888836638888\n889888888888888488888836638888\n889888888888888488888833388888\n889888888888888488888888888888\n889888888888888488888888888888\n889888888888888488888888888888\n889888888888888488888333388888\n889888888888888488888377777777\n889888888888888488888377388888\n889888888888888488888333888888\n889888888888888488888888888888\n339388888888888488888888888888\n399388888888888488888888888888\n399388888888888488888888888888\n333888888888888488888888888888\n888888888888888488888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_2_step_1\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Background** is color `8`.  \n   Color `3` forms a **frame/outline** around a **2\u00d72 interior block** of some other color (e.g., `2`, `4`, `6`, `7`, `9`).\n\n2. On each framed object, some outline cells are **missing** (they are `8` instead of `3`).  \n   Each such missing outline cell is an **opening**.\n\n3. **From each opening**, the interior color \u201cescapes\u201d as a **beam**:\n   - Find the interior-colored cell that touches the opening (touching can be orthogonal or diagonal).\n   - The beam direction is the step from that interior cell into the opening (one of the 8 directions).\n   - The beam **paints every `8` cell it travels through** with the interior color, continuing step by step.\n\n4. **Beams do not overwrite non-background** (anything not `8`, including the original `3` frames and other colors).\n\n5. **When two beams would step into the same next cell at the same time**, they do not enter that cell.  \n   Instead, they both \u201cdeflect\u201d by updating their directions to the **sign of the sum** of their direction vectors (this produces the kind of diagonal diversion seen in Example 3), and they continue from their current positions.  \n   The contested cell remains `8`.\n\nApplying these rules to the test input yields the following output.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6  \n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8  \n2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8  \n8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8  \n9,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,9,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 4>\n<CANDIDATE 5>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n888888888898888888884888888888\n768888888898888888884888888888\n768888888898888888888888888888\n768888888898888888888888888888\n768383388898888333888888888888\n768822388898883448888888888888\n768322388898883443888888888888\n768333888898883833888888888888\n786888888898888888888888688888\n788688888898888888888888868888\n788868888898888848884888886888\n788886888898888488884888888688\n788888688898288888884888888868\n788888868892888888884887888886\n888888886892888888884878688888\n888888888692888888884736638888\n888888888892888888874836638888\n888888888892888888784833388888\n888888888892888887884888888888\n888888888882888878884888888888\n888888888882888788884333388888\n888888888882887888884377888888\n888888888882878888884377368888\n888888888882788888884333688888\n889888888882888888884886888888\n339388888882888888884868888888\n399388888882888888884688888888\n399388888882888888884688888878\n333888888882888888884688888777\n888888888882888888884688888777\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_3\">\n**Task Understanding and Strategy**\n\nMy primary goal is to decipher and reproduce the pattern observed in a series of solved ARC tasks involving grids of integers (0-9). The core seems to be that small shapes/objects (often colored, denoted by the integers within the grid) generate \"trails\" that extend beyond the shape itself, and I need to figure out how these trails are generated, and in a way that handles edge cases and scale variations.\n\n**Early Observations and Hypotheses**\n\n*   **Background and Objects:** The background is typically 8 (teal). The grids have distinct shapes, objects, which are made of a border and a fill. I'm noting the numbers' structure within the objects.\n*   **Initial Trail Direction:** Initial examination hints at diagonal trails (likely North-West) emanating from the shapes. The output also contains the original shapes as a given.\n*   **Edge Wrapping/Boundary Behavior:** It seems that the trails \"wrap\" or reflect when they reach the edges of the grid. But, this has the nuance that the behavior could be based on a grid composed of smaller subgrids, rather than a whole.\n*   **The notion of vertical columns**: The test example hint to vertical segments. The rule may need to be composed of two separate diagonal and vertical parts.\n\n**Refinement and Algorithm**\n\n*   **Panel/Strip Structure:** The grid is divided into vertical \"strips\" of equal width, determined by the grid size and the number and positioning of objects. The trail behavior changes depending on the strip they are in.\n*   **Diagonal Trails:**\n    *   Trails are created at each corner of the inner box.\n    *   They emanate diagonally (Up-Right/Up-Left/Down-Right/Down-Left)\n    *   Each object has an assigned \"Target Column\". When a ray hits an edge of the Panel in which the shape lives, the ray \"jumps\" to a column within another panel:\n        *   Vertical lines are created at an assigned target column which is computed from the object index and position in the Grid.\n\n**Key Components of the Solution**\n\n1.  **Strip Width and Structure:** Determine the width of the repeating panels.\n2.  **Object-Specific Target Columns**:\n    *   Each object \"projects\" to a unique target column, a vertical line in another Panel. The rule for deriving the exact column needs to be made.\n3.  **Ray Tracing (Diagonal and Vertical):**\n    *   Generate rays from each corner of the inner portion of the object.\n    *   Track the ray as they interact with panel boundaries:\n    *   Draw the initial diagonal line; also compute the vertical segment to draw in the assigned target.\n4.  **Edge Wrapping/Panel Transfer**: Identify that a panel end is a boundary to the current panel, and draw the line in the \"target\" column.\n5.  **Output Generation:** The output is constructed by a combination of the input and the generated trails of color.\n\n\nThe task requires inferring a transformation that extends patterns from \"source objects\" (colored shapes) into \"trails\" (lines of the same color). Based on the solved examples, the transformation involves projecting diagonal rays from the corners of the shapes, which then form vertical lines at specific columns.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The 30x30 grid is treated as three vertical \"panels\" or \"strips\" of width 10 (Columns 0-9, 10-19, 20-29).\n2.  **Object Identification:** There are five objects in the test input. We identify them by their unique fill colors and positions:\n    *   **Maroon (9):** Bottom-left, Panel 0 (Center X $\\approx$ 2).\n    *   **Red (2):** Top-left, Panel 0 (Center X $\\approx$ 4).\n    *   **Yellow (4):** Top-middle, Panel 1 (Center X $\\approx$ 15).\n    *   **Orange (7):** Bottom-right, Panel 2 (Center X $\\approx$ 22).\n    *   **Magenta (6):** Middle-right, Panel 2 (Center X $\\approx$ 23).\n3.  **Target Columns:** Each object projects its color to a specific \"Target Column\" where a vertical line forms. The Target Column is determined by the formula:\n    `Target = (Panel_Index + 1) * 10 + Object_Index_In_Panel`\n    *   **Maroon (9):** Panel 0, Index 0 $\\rightarrow$ Target **10**.\n    *   **Red (2):** Panel 0, Index 1 $\\rightarrow$ Target **11**.\n    *   **Yellow (4):** Panel 1, Index 0 $\\rightarrow$ Target **20**.\n    *   **Orange (7):** Panel 2, Index 0 $\\rightarrow$ Target **0** (Wrap $30 \\to 0$).\n    *   **Magenta (6):** Panel 2, Index 1 $\\rightarrow$ Target **1**.\n4.  **Ray Tracing & Vertical Lines:**\n    *   Diagonal rays extend from the four corners of each object's fill area (UL, UR, DL, DR).\n    *   These rays travel until they intersect the object's **Target Column**. The grid wraps horizontally (Column 29 connects to 0).\n    *   From the intersection point:\n        *   **Upward rays (UL, UR):** Create a vertical line from the intersection row **up to the top** (Row 0) in the Target Column.\n        *   **Downward rays (DL, DR):** Create a vertical line from the intersection row **down to the bottom** (Row 29) in the Target Column.\n    *   The diagonal rays themselves are also drawn on the grid until they hit the grid boundary or target.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Col 10 (Maroon 9):** UR ray from (25,3) hits col 10 at row 18. Vertical 0-18. UL ray hits via wrap at row 3. Vertical 0-3. **Result: 9s at 0-18.**\n*   **Col 11 (Red 2):** DR ray from (6,5) hits col 11 at row 12. Vertical 12-29. DL ray hits via wrap at 29. **Result: 2s at 12-29.**\n*   **Col 20 (Yellow 4):** UR ray from (5,16) hits col 20 at row 1. Vertical 0-1. DR ray from (6,16) hits col 20 at row 10.

I've got four examples, and the general gist seems to be about identifying \"objects\" within a grid and then transforming them. The key seems to be these \"objects\" enclosed by a border and then figuring out how to re-create or extend them in the output. I'll need to look at each example carefully, comparing input and output, identifying patterns, and formulating hypotheses. I suspect it involves shapes, colors, and possibly diagonal extensions or patterns. I'll need to carefully analyze the coordinates and numbers. Let's start with Example 1.\n\n**Example 1: Object & Diagonal Beam Identification**\n\nIn Example 1, I see what looks like a teal background, and some objects. There is green and another inside the borders. The inner ones seem to be maroon, blue, yellow, and magenta. The initial impression is that the inner color shapes are re-created in the output, maybe with some kind of modification. The first object has a 2x2 maroon block. In the output, it looks like diagonals of the same color extend from the corners. It looks like it is an \"X\" shape. The X shape appears to have been added to the corners and sides. In example 1, it appears that the corners and sometimes sides are missing in the Input. The beams seem to be in the \"open\" directions. I'll carefully check this.\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation**\n\nIt's looking like the rule is:\n\n1.  **Identify the \"inner color\" block**: It's the enclosed portion within the border.\n2.  **Check for border holes**: Look for missing border pixels on all sides and corners.\n3.  **Create \"beams\"**: Extend lines of the inner color from the border holes.\n\n**Example 2: Further Analysis**\n\nOkay, let's test it in Example 2. It has an intact border. The rule seems to hold. The corners are NOT missing.\n\n**Example 3: Intersection and Refinement**\n\nHere I have a new situation in Example 3. There is an intersection of colors. My initial strategy is to draw the beams but let them overwrite.\nExample 3, there's a red shape and a yellow shape in the middle. Beams were generated and intersected. These created additional beams. It seems like the collision rule is more complex. Beams are generated and may create new shapes. Looking closer at the example, it looks like, in addition to vertical and horizontal beams, a new diagonal beam is generated at intersection points.\nFor the new diagonal beams, it seems to have two orthogonal (horizontal + vertical) beams meeting and creating a diagonal line.\n\n**Example 4: Rule Refinement and Generalization**\n\nExample 4 doesn't have horizontal and vertical parts, but only diagonal. All the corners are not-present (broken). Therefore, if a border is broken, diagonals are generated.\n\n**Final Algorithm and Implementation**\n\n1.  **Detect Objects:** Identify inner color and border, then the 8-connected component to see inner shape\n2.  **For each object**, Check all 8 neighbors (orthogonals and diagonals). Identify shell pixels from inner pixel.\n3.  **Missing border (value != border color) generates beams** :\n    -   Shoot beam of \"inner color\" extending in the empty direction, from the empty shell pixel.\n    -   A missing corner creates a beam at 45 degrees.\n4.  **At Beams and intersections**, no occlusion occurs, just drawing. If beams overlap, the rule is to simply plot all.\n\n**Test Input Analysis and Construction**\nI will create the output for the test grid. This is just applying the rules. I will be very careful to generate beams. I'll start with the base, and then plot the coordinates. I'll finish this carefully and then produce the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify objects defined by a border color (usually 3, green) enclosing an inner color. The transformation involves projecting \"beams\" of the inner color outwards from the object. The direction of these beams is determined by gaps or \"missing pieces\" in the border of the object in the input grid.\n\n**Rules derived from examples:**\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find rectangular blocks of an inner color surrounded by a border (typically color 3).\n2.  **Check Neighbors:** For each cell of the inner block, check its neighbors in the \"border shell\" (Up, Down, Left, Right, and the 4 Diagonals).\n3.  **Project Beams:**\n    *   If an orthogonal neighbor (Up, Down, Left, Right) in the border shell is **missing** (i.e., it is the background color 8 instead of the border color), project a beam of the inner color in that direction (Vertical or Horizontal).\n    *   If a diagonal neighbor (Corner) in the border shell is **missing**, project a diagonal beam of the inner color outwards from that corner.\n4.  **Beam Propagation:** Beams travel in a straight line until the edge of the grid, overwriting the background.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n**Object 1 (Red/2):** Inner block at Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5.\n*   **Missing Top** at (4,4): Beam **UP** (Color 2) at Col 4.\n*   **Missing Top-Right Corner** at (4,6): Beam **UP-RIGHT** (Color 2) starting at (4,6).\n*   **Missing Left** at (5,3): Beam **LEFT** (Color 2) at Row 5.\n*   **Missing Bottom-Right Corner** at (7,6): Beam **DOWN-RIGHT** (Color 2) starting at (7,6).\n\n**Object 2 (Yellow/4):** Inner block at Rows 5-6, Cols 15-16.\n*   **Missing Top-Right Corner** at (4,17): Beam **UP-RIGHT** (Color 4) starting at (4,17).\n*   **Missing Right** at (5,17): Beam **RIGHT** (Color 4) at Row 5.\n*   **Missing Bottom** at (7,15): Beam **DOWN** (Color 4) at Col 15.\n\n**Object 3 (Magenta/6):** Inner block at Rows 14-15, Cols 23-24.\n*   **Missing Top** at (13,23): Beam **UP** (Color 6) at Col 23.\n*   **Missing Top-Right Corner** at (13,25): Beam **UP-RIGHT** (Color 6) starting at (13,25).\n*   **Missing Bottom-Right Corner** at (16,25): Beam **DOWN-RIGHT** (Color 6) starting at (16,25).\n\n**Object 4 (Orange/7):** Inner block at Rows 20-21, Cols 22-23.\n*   **Missing Right** at (20,24): Beam **RIGHT** (Color 7) at Row 20.\n*   **Missing Bottom-Right Corner** at (22,24): Beam **DOWN-RIGHT** (Color 7) starting at (22,24).\n\n**Object 5 (Maroon/9):** Inner block at Rows 25-26, Cols 1-2.\n*   **Missing Top** at (24,2): Beam **UP** (Color 9) at Col 2.\n*   **Missing Bottom-Right Corner** at (27,3): Beam **DOWN-RIGHT** (Color 9) starting at (27,3).\n\nI will now generate the output grid by applying these beams to the input grid.\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,2,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

When lines from different shapes would collide, they run parallel instead of crossing\n\nFor the test input, I identified these shapes and their gaps:\n- Shape 1 (2s): gaps at (4,4)-up, (5,3)-left, (7,6)-diagonal down-right\n- Shape 2 (4s): gaps at (4,14)-diagonal up-left, (5,17)-right, (7,15)-down\n- Shape 3 (6s): gaps at (13,23)-up, (13,25)-diagonal up-right, (16,25)-diagonal down-right\n- Shape 4 (7s): gaps at (20,24)-right, (22,24)-diagonal down-right\n- Shape 5 (9s): gaps at (24,2)-up, (27,3)-diagonal down-right\n\nThe lines extend from these gaps, with shape 1's diagonal becoming parallel to shape 2's vertical when they meet.\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 7>\n<CANDIDATE 8>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n889828888848888888888886888888\n889828888884888888888886888888\n889828888888488888888886888888\n889828888888848888888886888888\n889323388888884333888886888888\n222222388888883444444444444444\n889322388888883443888886888888\n889333288888883433888886888888\n889888828888888488888886888888\n889888882888888488888886888886\n889888888288888488888886888868\n889888888828888488888886888688\n889888888882888488888886886888\n889888888888288488888836368888\n889888888888828488888836638888\n889888888888882488888836638888\n889888888888888288888833368888\n889888888888888428888888886888\n889888888888888482888888888688\n889888888888888488288333388868\n889888888888888488828377777776\n889888888888888488882377388888\n889888888888888488888333788888\n889888888888888488888888878888\n889888888888888488888888887888\n339388888888888488888888888788\n399388888888888488888888888878\n399388888888888488888888888887\n333988888888888488888888888888\n888898888888888488888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_4_step_3\">\n### Inferred rule from the examples\n\n- **8** is the background.\n- **3** forms a (usually incomplete) **rectangular frame** around a small **interior block** of some other color (the \u201cpayload\u201d color).\n\nFor **each framed object**:\n\n1. **Find the object\u2019s bounding box** (using all non-background cells of that object: the 3\u2019s plus the interior color cells).\n2. Look at the **perimeter cells** of that bounding box. Any perimeter cell that is still **background (8)** is an **opening (a \u201cgap\u201d)** in the frame.\n3. Each gap emits a **ray** of the interior color:\n   - If the gap is on the **top edge**, the ray goes **up**.\n   - **Bottom edge** \u2192 **down**.\n   - **Left edge** \u2192 **left**.\n   - **Right edge** \u2192 **right**.\n   - If the gap is at a **corner**, the ray goes **diagonally outward** from that corner.\n4. The ray **colors the gap cell itself** and then continues cell-by-cell in its direction, **coloring only background (8)** cells, stopping when it would leave the grid or hit a cell that was **already non-background in the original input** (frames/interiors act as blockers).\n5. If two rays claim the same background cell, the cell takes the color of the ray whose **gap is closest (fewest steps along that ray)**; ties are broken by the gap that appears first in reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n\nApplying that to the test input yields the following output grid.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 8>\n<CANDIDATE 9>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n889828888848888888888846889888\n829828888884888888888486898888\n282828888888488888884886988888\n829228888888848888848886888888\n882323388888884333488896888888\n222222388888883444444444444444\n889322388888883443889886888888\n889333288888883433898886888888\n889888828888884488688886888888\n889888882888848489868886888886\n889888888288488498886886888868\n889888888824888488888686888688\n889888888842889488888866886888\n889888888488298488888836368888\n889888884888928488888836638888\n889888848889882488888836638887\n889888488898888288888833368878\n889884888988888428888888886788\n889848889888888482888888887688\n889488898888888488288333378868\n884888988888888488828377777776\n849889888888888488882377388888\n489898888888888488888333788888\n889988888888888488888888878888\n339388888888888488888888887888\n399388888888888488888888888788\n399388888888888488888888888878\n333988888888888488888888888887\n888898888888888488888888888888\n888889888888888488888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_3_step_3\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nAll examples have:\n- **Background color = 8**\n- **Frame / boundary color = 3**\n- One or more **\u201ccore\u201d colors** (anything that is **not 8 and not 3**, e.g. 2,4,6,7,9).\n\nThe transformation is a **ray-casting / \u201cleaking paint\u201d** rule:\n\n1. **Keep the input exactly as-is** (all 3\u2019s and all core-colored pixels stay).\n2.

When two rays would paint the same background cell, the practical way to match the behavior is:\n   - **Never overwrite a non-8 already painted cell** (so earlier rays keep their color).  \n   (This only matters when rays overlap; most training examples don\u2019t overlap, but the test does.)\n\nThis exactly explains the added straight lines/diagonals in the examples: rays only emerge where a core pixel has a neighboring 8 (a \u201cgap\u201d in the 3-frame), and they travel in that direction until blocked.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid for the test input\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,9,8,8,8  \n8,2,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,9,8,8,8,8  \n2,8,2,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,2,9,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,9,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,4,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,9,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,7  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,7,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,7,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6  \n8,4,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n4,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 9>\n<CANDIDATE 10>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n828888888284888888886488888888\n882888882888488888888688888888\n888288828888848888888868888888\n888828288888884884888886888888\n888222288888884444888888688888\n888822388888883448888888868888\n888322388888883443888888886888\n888233288888884833488888888688\n888888888888888886888888888868\n888888888888888868888888888886\n888888888888888688888888888868\n888888888888886888888888888688\n888888888888868888888888886888\n888888888888888888888866668888\n888888888888888888888836638888\n888888888888888888888836638888\n888888888888888888888863368888\n888888888888888888888688886888\n888888888888888888886888888688\n888888888888888888868888888868\n888888888888888888688777788886\n888888888888888886888377888868\n888888888888888868888377388688\n888888888888888688888733786888\n888888888888886888887888878888\n999988888888868888878888887888\n399388888888688888788888888788\n399388888886888887888888888878\n933988888868888878888888888887\n988898888688888788888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n**1. Initial Assessment and Pattern Identification**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at an ARC task, likely involving some kind of transformation on an input grid to produce an output grid. My initial thought process involves breaking down Example 1 to identify patterns. I see that there's a background color (8), and some distinct shapes within it, each with a core color (9, 1, 4, 6) and a border of 3s. The shapes seem to be 4x4 or 4x5 blocks, and I'm noting the positions of these cores in the input relative to the grid. I'm focusing on the input grid's structure.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what each shape is doing. I can see these core colors are inside a ring of 3s, which leaves the corners of the box as 8s.\n\nI notice that the output shows those cores, but there are also what look like diagonal lines emanating from them. And also the corners of the 4x4 or 5 boxes change to the core color.\n\n**2. Refining the Transformation Rule**\n\nAlright, it looks like there's a specific set of rules.\n\nIt appears the process is:\n\n**A. Identify the object:** It's a structure with a 2x2 core of color C, surrounded by a border of 3s. There are missing corners.\n**B. Fill the corners:** Take the corners of the shape, which are usually 8s, and fill them with the core color.\n**C. Emit the beam:** The next step is diagonal projections from the filled corners.\n**D. Interact with the environment:** Diagonal lines that go out from the core's bounding box that intersect grid lines or other shapes.\n\nI start testing to see the behaviour in several shapes of the grid. It looks as though the beam interaction is important.\n\n**3. Applying to the Test Input and Handling Beams and Interactions**\n\nOkay, now let's apply these rules to a new test case. I need to find these shapes first, especially when they overlap. I'll identify the bounding box and the core within it. In my mind, I'm imagining how these lines are going to work based on the rules. I'm imagining them going out, and what will happen when they hit walls or other beams.\n\nI'm imagining where the shapes are. I'll follow the same procedure as before.\n\n**4. Generating the Final Output Grid**\n\nSo, with all the rules sorted out, I feel confident about generating the output grid. I am checking collisions again. I am imagining where all the lines are. I am noting how the lines will go, what color they will be, and where they will stop. I will generate an outline for each section and build up the output grid.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I will apply a transformation rule based on the analysis of the provided examples (1 through 4).\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The grid contains several \"core-border\" shapes. Each shape consists of a 2x2 \"core\" of a specific color $C$, surrounded by a border of color 3 (green). The corners of the shape's rectangular bounding box are initially the background color (8).\n2.  **Fill Corners:** For each identified shape, the four corners of its bounding box are filled with the shape's core color $C$.\n3.  **Emit Diagonal Beams:** From these newly filled corners, beams of color $C$ are emitted outwards into the background.\n    *   **Direction:**\n        *   Shapes in the **top half** of the grid emit beams **upwards** (Up-Left and Up-Right).\n        *   Shapes in the **bottom half** of the grid emit beams **downwards** (Down-Left and Down-Right).\n        *   Shapes in the **middle** of the grid (like the Magenta one in the test input) emit beams in **all four diagonal directions**.\n    *   **Reflection:** If a beam hits the vertical grid boundaries (left or right walls), it reflects at a 90-degree angle (like a billiard ball).\n    *   **Interaction/Termination:**\n        *   If a beam encounters another shape, it connects to it and stops.\n        *   If two beams of different colors are on a collision course to land on the same pixel (head-on collision), they stop one step early and turn vertical (or simply stop), preserving the gap between them. In Example 1, beams 9 and 1 became adjacent and turned vertical. Here, the Red (2) and Yellow (4) top beams would collide at (0,10). Following the \"adjacency/vertical\" precedence, they likely stop or deviate to (0,9) and (0,11).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shapes Identified:**\n    *   **Top-Left:** Red Core (2), bounding box rows 4-7, cols 3-6.\n    *   **Top-Right:** Yellow Core (4), bounding box rows 4-7, cols 14-17.\n    *   **Middle:** Magenta Core (6), bounding box rows 13-16, cols 22-25.\n    *   **Bottom-Left:** Maroon Core (9), bounding box rows 25-28, cols 0-3.\n    *   **Bottom-Right:** Orange Core (7), bounding box rows 20-23, cols 21-24.\n\n*   **Step 1: Fill Corners:**\n    *   Red: (4,3), (4,6), (7,3), (7,6) -> 2.\n    *   Yellow: (4,14), (4,17), (7,14), (7,17) -> 4.\n    *   Magenta: (13,22), (13,25), (16,22), (16,25) -> 6.\n    *   Orange: (20,21), (20,24), (23,21), (23,24) -> 7.\n    *   Maroon: (25,0), (25,3), (28,0), (28,3) -> 9.\n\n*   **Step 2: Project Beams:**\n\n    *   **Red (Top, Upwards):**\n        *   Left (from 4,3): Travels to (0,1) via reflection at wall (column 0).\n        *   Right (from 4,6): Travels to (0,10). **Collision Check:** Hits Yellow beam.\n    *   **Yellow (Top, Upwards):**\n        *   Left (from 4,14): Travels to (0,10). **Collision Check:** Meets Red beam.\n            *   *Resolution:* Red stops at (0,9), Yellow stops at (0,11).

The goal is to figure out the rules that govern the formation of \"beams\" emanating from colored shapes, given a grid with these shapes and an expected output grid. Let's break it down:\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics:** The user wants me to solve this. I see distinct objects in the input. Each object has a core color and a border color (usually teal or a background color). Each object in the input has a central color and a surrounding ring. I'm looking for how this shape maps to \"beams\" on the output grid.\n2.  **Initial Hypothesis:** I start by looking at a number of examples. I see lines with the colors from the object in specific directions. I notice the shapes of the objects vary. They usually have a colored center and border 3 (or the same color of the background).\n3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** My initial intuition is that the direction of the beam is influenced by the shape of the border. I see that border pixel has \"gaps.\"\n4.  **The \"Nozzle\" Hypothesis:** The direction of the beam depends on which parts of the border are open and which parts are closed. Imagine each of the 3s as walls, and gaps are the openings the \"light\" shoots through. If a border pixel is part of the border, the beam is blocked. If an input grid value is the background, it means there is a gap that allows the beam to pass.\n5.  **Examine Corner Cases:** I look at various combinations of shapes. The beams shoot in orthogonal directions and diagonal directions. I look at each example very carefully to build a model that explains where the beams come from based on border geometry.\n6.  **Edge Analysis:** I think of a perimeter or \"border\" for the central core of pixels. This border has orthogonal edge pieces, and 4 corners. Border pixels can be open, closed, or part of a side. Beams can come from gaps or corners.\n7.  **Finalize the Model:** Each object has a specific pattern of open and closed sections that direct the beams. I formalize the rules: open is 8 (background color), a corner is open to diagonal.\n    *   I see a relationship: orthogonal directions come from border pixels, diagonal directions come from corner pixels, where pixels are background pixels.\n8.  **Test and Verify:** I run this model with all examples. It works!\n9.  **Execution Plan:** I map each shape from the initial grid input to its specific beam-launching configuration.\n10. **Test Data Application:** I take the test input, analyze the structure of each object, and create the projected output based on the model.\n11. **Grid Implementation:** I'm careful to address issues such as beam collisions. If overlapping occurs, the earlier beam overwrites the latest beam (or the latest one overrides, based on a pattern or object order, or maybe the source color).\n12. **Final Touches:** I generate the final output and check one last time.\n\nIn essence, it's about carefully interpreting geometric cues to decode the beam directionality rule.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I analyzed the provided examples to understand the relationship between the objects (colored cores surrounded by `3`-colored borders) and the beams of light they emit.\n\n**1. Object Structure:**\nEach object consists of a 2x2 core of a specific color `C`, surrounded by a ring of 12 pixels. The ring is primarily color `3` (green), acting as a \"nozzle\" or \"shield\". The pixels in this ring can be `3` (Closed) or `8` (Open/Background).\n\n**2. Transformation Rule:**\nThe beams emerge from the `Open` pixels (gaps) in the `3`-border. The direction of the beam depends on the position of the gap relative to the 2x2 core.\nMapping the 12 border positions (relative to a 4x4 box where the core is central):\n*   **Corners (TL, TR, BL, BR):** A gap in a corner emits a **Diagonal** beam in that direction.\n    *   Example: Top-Left Corner Gap -> Beam Up-Left.\n*   **Sides (Top, Bottom, Left, Right):** Each side has 2 pixels (e.g., Top-Left side `T1` and Top-Right side `T2`).\n    *   **Right-Half of an Edge (T2, R2, B2, L2):** Emits an **Orthogonal** beam (Up, Right, Down, Left).\n        *   Gap at Top-Right side (`T2`) -> Beam Up.\n        *   Gap at Right-Bottom side (`R2`) -> Beam Right.\n    *   **Left-Half of an Edge (T1, R1, B1, L1):** Emits a **Diagonal** beam or Horizontal/Vertical beam skewed to that side. Based on Examples 3 and 4, these produce beams consistent with the \"Propeller\" or specific diagonal logic:\n        *   Gap at Top-Left side (`T1`) -> Beam **Up-Left**.\n        *   Gap at Right-Top side (`R1`) -> Beam **Up-Right**.\n        *   Gap at Left-Top side (`L1`) -> Beam **Left** (Horizontal).\n        *   Gap at Left-Bottom side (`L2`) -> Beam **Down-Left**.\n\n**3. Applying to Test Input:**\nI identified 4 objects in the test input and applied the logic:\n\n*   **Object 1 (Red `2`, Top-Left):**\n    *   **Gap at T1** (Top edge, left pixel): Emits **Up-Left Diagonal**.\n    *   **Gap at L1** (Left edge, top pixel): Emits **Left Horizontal**.\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow `4`, Top-Right):**\n    *   **Gap at R1** (Right edge, top pixel): Emits **Up-Right Diagonal**.\n    *   **Gap at BL** (Bottom-Left Corner): Emits **Down-Left Diagonal**.\n*   **Object 3 (Green `7`, Middle-Right):**\n    *   **Gap at R1** (Right edge, top pixel): Emits **Up-Right Diagonal**.\n*   **Object 4 (Maroon `9`, Bottom-Left):**\n    *   **Gap at T2** (Top edge, right pixel): Emits **Up Vertical**.\n    *   **Gap at BR** (Bottom-Right Corner): Emits **Down-Right Diagonal**.\n\nI traced these beams on the 30x30 grid, handling intersections by prioritizing the object logic (Red overwrites Maroon at crossing points).\n\n**Final Output

model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the following transformation rules:\n\n1. **Each shape has a 3-border with intentional gaps and a 2x2 colored interior**\n2. **From each gap, a line extends outward in the interior color:**\n   - Corner gaps \u2192 diagonal lines in that corner's direction\n   - Edge gaps (middle of edge) \u2192 straight lines perpendicular to that edge\n3. **When lines from different shapes would intersect, the intersection cell becomes 8 (empty), but both lines continue past it**\n\nFor the test input, I identified 5 shapes:\n- Shape 1 (2s): gaps at (4,4)\u2192vertical up, (5,3)\u2192horizontal left, (7,6)\u2192diagonal down-right\n- Shape 2 (4s): gaps at (4,14)\u2192diagonal up-left, (5,17)\u2192horizontal right, (7,15)\u2192vertical down\n- Shape 3 (6s): gaps at (13,23)\u2192vertical up, (13,25)\u2192diagonal up-right, (16,25)\u2192diagonal down-right\n- Shape 4 (7s): gaps at (20,24)\u2192horizontal right, (22,24)\u2192diagonal down-right\n- Shape 5 (9s): gaps at (24,2)\u2192vertical up, (27,3)\u2192diagonal down-right\n\nKey intersections create gaps at (5,2), (5,23), (16,15), and (20,29).\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\nAlright, let's see. This ARC task is really about these \"paths\" or \"rays\" that are emitted from the corners of these colorful objects within a grid. My first thought is to understand how these rays are created and how they interact.\n\nI see that the color of these rays seems to depend on the color of the payload within each object. For example, a Maroon object emits Maroon rays. The shapes of these objects don't seem super important, but let's make a mental note about the green frames, like bounding boxes. The key seems to be the color and position of the object, plus how the rays interact.\n\nOkay, in example 1, it looks like rays shoot from the corners and when they meet, something happens. It also seems that there are 4 rays in total, from each corner. It is useful that the rays that emerge from neighboring frames are the same color. And they seem to be diagonal, but if they meet, they bend? Yes, it is the case.\n\nI'm starting to think about this in terms of \"interaction rules\" or \"collision rules.\" When rays from objects *come close*, they modify themselves. They also stop at the border of the grid. It's like a geometric problem. And the problem is about connecting the colored rectangles/objects with these colored rays and how they meet.\n\nThe examples are key. In example 1, I see that lines going to the sides meet, and then go up. And if the objects are close, they meet. If the objects are far, they go to the border, like two diagonal lines.\n\nAlso, the \"staircase\" hint is weird, but it seems that the rays that go diagonal, actually go a diagonal step then horizontal, almost like two rays. Sometimes they meet. The staircase hint must mean something.\n\nLet's look at it from a different angle.\n\nWhat's the relationship between the objects in the example output? Are the rays *connecting* anything? It looks like it.\n\nA more clear rule is coming into focus. Rays will be emitted from the *corners* of a simplified shape such as a bounding box. Then, when the rays meet, a rule applies. Also, the rays are only diagonal.\n\nOkay, if two rays come close, then vertical lines form. If the rays are more separated, they just go diagonally.\n\nLet's look at more examples. The behavior of the rays seems pretty consistent. When rays of the same color are next to one another, they combine.\n\nLet's summarize.\nFor now, the rules are:\n1.  From the objects, rays extend to the border of the image, the color of which matches the center object.\n2.  If two rays meet, they turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n\nIt seems to be all about the edges and corners of the objects and how they interact. If the objects don't interact, the lines will go to the side.\n\nOkay, let's look at example 2, 3 and 4 again.\n\nThis \"Test Input\" is helpful. I see how all the rays interact in different parts of the graph. Horizontal rays interact to make a straight horizontal line, vertical rays combine to make a straight horizontal line and diagonal rays continue without intersection to the border.\n\nNow, I think I have enough information to solve this and make a proper summary.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I identified the following rules based on the examples:\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The input contains objects defined by green (`3`) frames enclosing a core of a different color (the \"payload\"). The green frame marks the object's boundary.\n2.  **Ray Emission**: Each of the four corners of an object's bounding box emits a diagonal ray in the color of the payload.\n    *   Top-Left (TL) corner emits a ray Up-Left.\n    *   Top-Right (TR) corner emits a ray Up-Right.\n    *   Bottom-Left (BL) corner emits a ray Down-Left.\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR) corner emits a ray Down-Right.\n3.  **Ray Propagation & Interaction**:\n    *   Rays travel diagonally until they hit the grid border or interact with another ray.\n    *   **Horizontal Interaction**: If two objects are horizontally aligned (or close), their facing rays (e.g., UR of the left object and UL of the right object) converge. When they meet or become adjacent, they turn **vertical**.\n        *   Top rays turn Vertical Up.\n        *   Bottom rays turn Vertical Down.\n        *   The vertical lines run parallel if the gap allows, effectively extending from the convergence point to the grid edge.\n    *   **Vertical Interaction**: If two objects are vertically aligned, their facing rays (e.g., DL of the top object and UL of the bottom object) converge. When they meet or become adjacent, they turn **horizontal**.\n        *   Left-side rays turn Horizontal Left.\n        *   Right-side rays turn Horizontal Right.\n4.  **No Interaction**: Rays that do not encounter a matching ray from another object continue straight diagonally to the grid border.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Object 1 (Red, 2)**: Top-Left region (Row 4-7, Col 3-6).\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow, 4)**: Top-Right region (Row 4-7, Col 14-17).\n    *   **Interaction**: These form a horizontal pair.\n    *   **Top**: Red UR and Yellow UL converge at the top border (Col 10). Diagonal lines drawn to meet there.\n    *   **Bottom**: Red DR and Yellow DL converge below the objects. They turn vertical downwards at Row 10, running down Columns 9 and 11 respectively.\n*   **Object 3 (Magenta, 6)**: Middle-Right (Row 13-16, Col 22-25).\n*   **Object 4 (Orange, 7)**: Bottom-Right (Row 19-22, Col 21-24).\n    *   **Interaction**: These form a vertical pair.\n    *   **Left**: Magenta DL and Orange UL converge between the objects (Row 17/18).

The goal is to analyze these ARC tasks, figure out how they work and then generate the correct output.  I'll break this down:\n\n**1.  Initial Observations & Goal:** The user wants me to solve these ARC puzzles based on examples. I need to analyze how the *inputs* (cyan background, green \"frame-like\" objects with color payloads) translate into the *outputs* (which have paths drawn).\n\n**2.  Pattern Recognition:** I\u2019m noticing there's a specific pattern:\n\n    *   **Frame Structure:** The green frames mark the area where the path should emerge, but the actual path *doesn't* use green.\n    *   **Payload Colors:** There's a color \u201cpayload\u201d *inside* the green frame and that dictates the color of the path drawn.\n    *   **Hole Detection:** Where the frame is not *completely* closed - usually at corners/gaps - determines how the path starts and its initial direction! I kept thinking it was the entire shape of the green frame, but that's not it. It's about where the frame *stops*.\n    *   **Line Extension:** Once a *hole* is detected, the path \u201cleaks\u201d out. The direction the path goes appears to correspond to the *neighboring* cells of the payload. It\u2019s a neighbor \u201ccheck\u201d.\n    *   **Grid Boundaries:** The paths extend to the borders of the grid.  Sometimes these go through a \u201cstaircase\u201d diagonal.\n\n**3.  Important Insights:**\n\n    *   **Coordinate system/Indices:** I re-read carefully, because it's easy to make mistakes with this kind of data!\n    *   **Vector Rules:** So far, it looks like a neighbor check to determine \"holes\" in the grid.\n    *   **Diagonal Paths vs. Shift:** I've had to throw out the simple idea of \"perfect diagonals\" because they don't apply, *always*.\n    *   **Overlapping Paths:** I will take into account *overlapping* path cells, just to be precise.  These will *not* be a problem though.\n\n**4.  Test Input Analysis (Most Important Part):** I'll use a test input to confirm everything. I'm going to determine \"holes\", vector rules and directions.\n\n**5.  Output Generation Process:** I\u2019ll now go through all the objects in the test input, identify the \"Hole\", the path vector (based on the neighboring cells) and generate all of the coordinates for the path. I won't *overwrite* any existing *non-8* values, which means objects *won't* have paths drawn *over* them. I'll need a *string-based* output format to represent this.\n\n**6.  Final Coordinate Generation:** I'll map all the individual coordinate points I found and I'll build the output string, which will now have the paths added.\n\nI believe this is all the logic. I can see I've double checked for all possible errors.\n\n\nThe task requires identifying \"objects\" in the grid (defined by green frames containing colored payloads) and extending \"paths\" from them. Based on the analysis of the solved examples, the rule for generating these paths is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Each object consists of a green (3) frame surrounding a 2x2 block of \"payload\" pixels (other colors like 9, 1, 4, 6, 2, 7).\n2.  **Locate \"Holes\":** Examine the 8 immediate neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) of each pixel in the 2x2 payload.\n    *   If a neighbor is a background pixel (8) (i.e., there is a gap in the green frame), it is considered a \"Hole\".\n3.  **Extend Paths:** For each payload pixel with a neighboring Hole, draw a path starting from that Hole.\n    *   **Color:** The path takes the color of the payload.\n    *   **Direction:** The direction is defined by the vector from the Payload pixel to the Hole pixel.\n        *   Example: If the Hole is directly above the Payload pixel, the path goes vertically UP.\n        *   Example: If the Hole is diagonally down-right from the Payload pixel, the path goes diagonally DOWN-RIGHT.\n    *   **Length:** The path extends in a straight line until it hits the grid boundary.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Object 1 (Red 2, Top-Left):**\n    *   Hole at `(4,4)` (Top of Payload `(5,4)`). Vector: UP. Path: Red vertical line at column 4 from row 3 to 0.\n    *   Hole at `(5,3)` (Left of Payload `(5,4)`). Vector: LEFT. Path: Red horizontal line at row 5 from column 2 to 0.\n    *   Hole at `(7,6)` (Down-Right of Payload `(6,5)`). Vector: DOWN-RIGHT. Path: Red diagonal line starting at `(8,7)`.\n\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow 4, Top-Right):**\n    *   Hole at `(5,17)` (Right of Payload `(5,16)`). Vector: RIGHT. Path: Yellow horizontal line at row 5 from column 18 to 29.\n    *   Hole at `(7,15)` (Down of Payload `(6,15)`). Vector: DOWN. Path: Yellow vertical line at column 15 from row 8 to 29.\n\n*   **Object 3 (Magenta 6, Mid-Right):**\n    *   Hole at `(13,23)` (Top of Payload `(14,23)`). Vector: UP. Path: Magenta vertical line at column 23 from row 12 to 0.\n    *   Hole at `(16,25)` (Down-Right of Payload `(15,24)`). Vector: DOWN-RIGHT. Path: Magenta diagonal line starting at `(17,26)`.\n\n*   **Object 4 (Orange 7, Bottom-Mid):**\n    *   Hole at `(20,24)` (Right of Payload `(20,23)`). Vector: RIGHT. Path: Orange horizontal line at row 20 from column 25 to 29.\n    *   Hole at `(22,24)` (Down-Right of Payload `(21,23)`). Vector: DOWN-RIGHT. Path: Orange diagonal line starting at `(23,25)`.\n\n*   **Object 5 (Maroon 9, Bottom-Left):**\n    *   Hole at `(24,2)` (Top of Payload `(25,2)`). Vector: UP. Path: Maroon vertical line at column 2 from row 23 to 0.\n    *   Hole at `(27,3)` (Down-Right of Payload `(26,2)`). Vector: DOWN-RIGHT. Path: Maroon diagonal line starting at `(28,4)`.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\nI will map these paths onto the input grid, replacing the background '8's with the corresponding colors.\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 16>\n<CANDIDATE 17>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n889888888848888888888886888888\n889888888884888888888886888888\n889888888888488888888886888888\n889828888888848888888886888888\n889323388888884333888886888888\n222222388888883444444446444444\n889322388888883443888886888888\n889333288888883433888886888888\n889888828888888488888886888888\n889888882888888488888886888886\n889888888288888488888886888868\n889888888828888488888886888688\n889888888882888488888886886888\n889888888888288488888836368888\n889888888888828488888836638888\n889888888888882488888836638888\n889888888888888488888833368888\n889888888888888428888888886888\n889888888888888482888888888688\n889888888888888488288333388868\n889888888888888488828377777777\n889888888888888488882377388888\n889888888888888488888333788888\n889888888888888488888888878888\n339388888888888488888888887888\n399388888888888488888888888788\n399388888888888488888888888878\n333988888888888488888888888887\n888898888888888488888888888888\n888889888888888488888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_5_step_5_generate_hint\">\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the pattern:\n\n1.

The user wants me to figure out a pattern from a set of solved examples to apply to a new input. It looks like we're dealing with grids of numbers that represent colored shapes. The primary goal is to predict the output grid based on the input.\n\n**Initial Observations**\n\nThe background is a teal color, and we have smaller colored structures, possibly squares or partial squares, with a central core of a different color. The key seems to be the relationship between the shapes of these colored structures in the input and the pattern of colored lines in the output. The structures have borders that contain gaps.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1.  **Structure of the Example**: Let's examine a specific example. We see a green border (color 3) surrounding a core of a different color. The gaps in these green borders seem crucial. It appears that the output lines emanate from these gaps.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis: Gap-Driven Line Generation**: Maybe the gaps in the border point to the direction of the lines. If there's no green pixel blocking a direction, a line of the core color \"shoots out\". For a 2x2 core: A core at (r,c), (r,c+1), (r+1,c), (r+1,c+1). The green pixels are at (r-1,c), (r-1,c+1), (r,c-1), (r,c+2), (r+1,c-1), (r+1,c+2), (r+2,c), (r+2,c+1). The \"gaps\" are the four corners of the border (r-1,c-1), (r-1,c+2), (r+2,c-1), (r+2,c+2). This \"gap hypothesis\" checks out for the first input. The output lines are in the diagonal direction of the gaps.\n\n3.  **Color Matters**: However, the example of a blue and maroon shape of the same geometry produces a different output. The color of the core must influence the output behavior. So, is there an odd/even correlation? Not apparent. This might mean we need a lookup table for the colors.\n\n4.  **Blue Exception**: The blue core shape with the same border geometry has vertical and horizontal output lines. Something is different with the Blue core. It might \"permeate\" the borders and be the exception. In fact, if we look at the image, Blue's corners are closed with green, while Maroon is open at the same locations. So the rule \"Shoot through Gap\" becomes \"Shoot through Wall\", so Blue and the shape produces lines perpendicular to the green pixels that close the geometry of the core.\n\n5.  **Revising the Hypothesis (Wall/Gap Shooter)**:\n    *   I'll call Blue a \"wall shooter\" (shooting through walls or green pixels) and all other cores are \"gap shooters\".\n    *   If color is blue, shoot a beam in the neighbor's location if it has a green pixel.\n    *   If color is not blue, shoot a beam in the neighbor's location if it has an empty pixel.\n\n6.  **Refinement - Granular \"Gap Shooter\"**: The initial model had gaps defined at the corner pixels. Instead, each individual pixel of the 2x2 core checks all outward-facing neighbors. For the Top-Left of Core: Up, Left, Up-Left. (and same thing with core's Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right)\n    *   **Blue cores**: The presence of green neighbors triggers beam generation. (Wall Shooter).\n    *   **Non-Blue cores**: The presence of empty neighbors triggers beam generation. (Gap Shooter).\n\n7.  **Final Model Verification**:\n    *   Using this hypothesis, apply it to the new input.\n    *   Scan the input grid for cores. The coordinates become available.\n    *   Identify the four 12 neighbors.\n    *   Apply the Blue exception. For Blue cores (color 1), a beam radiates in the direction of any green neighbor. For any other core, a beam radiates in the direction of empty space.\n    *   Draw the beams. If there is a \"collision\", overwrite (I'll assume a \"first come first serve\" rule or whatever the system's rule is for conflicts).\n\nThe final step will be to implement this approach on the example to see if all example outputs become reproducible with the proposed model.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rule is determined by the \"green casing\" (pixels of color 3) surrounding the 2x2 core of each object. The core color itself determines the color of the emitted beams, but the **direction** of the beams is determined by the **gaps** in the green casing.\n\n**Rule:**\n1.  Identify each object consisting of a 2x2 core of a unique color surrounded by green (3) pixels.\n2.  For each of the 4 pixels making up the 2x2 core, check its immediate outward-facing neighbors in the surrounding 1-pixel wide ring (orthogonal and diagonal).\n    *   **Top-Left Core Pixel**: Check Up, Left, and Up-Left neighbors.\n    *   **Top-Right Core Pixel**: Check Up, Right, and Up-Right neighbors.\n    *   **Bottom-Left Core Pixel**: Check Down, Left, and Bottom-Left neighbors.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Core Pixel**: Check Down, Right, and Bottom-Right neighbors.\n3.  If a neighbor is \"Open\" (color 8), a beam of the core's color is emitted in that direction.\n4.  The beam travels in a straight line until it hits the edge of the grid or another object.\n    *   **Exception**: If the core is Blue (1), it emits beams through the *Walls* (where the neighbor is 3) instead of gaps. However, there are no Blue cores in the test input.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Red Object (Color 2)** at R5-6, C4-5:\n    *   **Up**: The neighbor at R4, C4 is 8 (Open). **Beam Up**.\n    *   **Left**: The neighbor at R5, C3 is 8 (Open). **Beam Left**.\n    *   Other directions are blocked by 3s.\n\n2.  **Yellow Object (Color 4)** at R5-6, C15-16:\n    *   **Up-Left (NW)**: The neighbor at R4, C14 is 8 (Open). **Beam NW**.\n    *   **Right**: The neighbor at R5, C17 is 8 (Open). **Beam Right**.\n    *   **Down**: The neighbor at R7, C15 is 8 (Open). **Beam Down**.\n    *   Other directions are blocked.\n\n3.  **Magenta Object (Color 6)** at R14-15, C23-24:\n    *   **Up**: The neighbor at R13, C23 is 8 (Open). **Beam Up**.\n    *   **Up-Right (NE)**: The neighbor at R13, C25 is 8 (Open). **Beam NE**.\n    *   **Down-Right (SE)**: The neighbor at R16, C25 is 8 (Open). **Beam SE**.\n    *   Note: The SW corner at R16, C22 is 3 (Blocked).\n\n4.  **Orange Object (Color 7)** at R20-21, C22-23:\n    *   **Right**: The neighbor at R20, C24 is 8 (Open). **Beam Right**.\n    *   **Down-Right (SE)**: The neighbor at R22, C24 is 8 (Open). **Beam SE**.\n\n5.  **Maroon Object (Color 9)** at R25-26, C1-2:\n    *   **Up**: The neighbor at R24, C2 is 8 (Open). **Beam Up**.\n    *   **Down-Right (SE)**: The neighbor at R27, C3 is 8 (Open). **Beam SE**.\n\n**Generated Output:**\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,8,2,2,3,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 20>\n<CANDIDATE 21>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n888828888888888888888876888888\n888828888888888888888876888888\n888828888888888888888876888888\n888828888888888888888876888888\n888383388888888333888876888888\n222822388888883448444476444444\n888322388888883443888876888888\n888333888888883833888876888888\n888888888888888848888876888888\n888888888888888848888876888888\n888888888888888848888876888888\n888888888888888848888876888888\n888888888888888848888876888888\n666666666666666646666636636666\n666666666666666646666636636666\n888888888888888848888833388888\n888888888888888848888876888888\n888888888888888848888876888888\n888888888888888848888876888888\n888888888888888848888333388888\n888888888888888848888377877777\n888888888888888848888377388888\n888888888888888848888333888888\n888888888888888848888886888888\n338388888888888848888886888888\n399388888888888848888886888888\n399388888888888848888886888888\n333888888888888848888886888888\n888888888888888848888886888888\n888888888888888848888886888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_7_step_5_image\">\n**Deep Dive into ARC Problem-Solving**\n\nAlright, let's break down this ARC problem. I'm seeing a pattern: the grids have a teal background, and small objects are popping up, each with a colored core enclosed by a green border. My first instinct is to try and define the object's structure, focusing on a typical object. It seems the green border isn't always a complete box; there are gaps. I want to nail down how those gaps affect the solution.\n\nI'm specifically looking at the relationships between the colors. My mind keeps flipping between individual objects, considering their position, and trying to trace the lines in relation to gaps and corners. In Example 1, I find the core of each object and then analyze the color layout. I can clearly see a circular layout with gaps in certain places. From looking, a gap in the green box leads to a projection of a line, but I can also see examples where there are no gaps but there still is projection.\n\nI am reevaluating the nature of 'gaps,' and I think the concept of 'walls' might provide an important concept in understanding this puzzle. I realize the structure of these lines is important, but how it emerges is much more fascinating. Now I know that, when fully enclosed, the lines originate outwards in all directions.\n\nIn Example 2, the grid has a yellow, 2x2 structure with different border colors. There is a gap at the top and the right, which creates an obvious line. These two experiments provide a pattern for the relationship between border gaps and the outward flow of colored lines. This proves that, when there is a lack of a wall, that line extends outward.\n\nNow I am going back, reevaluating the previous example images, and noticing diagonal lines. Looking at the yellow structure, I can see the lines are vertical and horizontal. It isn't random. The images are a perfect application of what I have discovered, so far.\n\nMy new hypothesis: *Lines emerge from the core color through gaps.*\n\nI've tested this hypothesis, but I noticed something was inconsistent with previous evidence. I am noticing that when two different lines encounter each other, they stop at the boundary where they intersect.\n\nI'm not so sure. Some of the test cases aren't working as well with my rules as I had hoped. The best approach is to examine each element of the layout: 1. Find all green, 2. Identify inner colored pixels, 3. find openings, and 4. draw the lines.\n\nIn the test case, I am seeing three objects. The red core is partially enclosed; the yellow core is enclosed with gaps on the side; the magenta is fully enclosed. All of these factors will influence how the object generates lines. The lines are also able to collide. I am confident I have all the pieces I need to write my solution.\n\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying colored objects enclosed in green borders and extending lines of the object's core color outwards.\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all objects consisting of a core of a specific color (not 8 or 3) surrounded by a green (3) border or partially surrounded.\n    *   **Red Object:** Core (2) at Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5.\n    *   **Yellow Object:** Core (4) at Rows 5-6, Cols 16-17.\n    *   **Magenta Object:** Core (6) at Rows 14-15, Cols 23-24.\n    *   **Orange Object:** Core (7) at Rows 20-21, Cols 22-23.\n\n2.  **Determine Line Directions:**\n    *   **Partially Enclosed Objects:** Lines extend from the core through any **gaps** (8s) in the immediate 4-neighbor green border.\n        *   **Red Object:**\n            *   Top Side (Row 4): Pattern `3, 8` above core `2, 2` (indices 4,5). Col 4 is `8` (Gap). -> **Line Up** from Col 4.\n            *   Left Side (Col 3): Pattern `8, 3` left of core `2, 2` (rows 5,6).

Row 5 is `8` (Gap). -> **Line Right** from Row 5.\n            *   Bottom Side (Row 7): Pattern `8, 3` below core `4, 4` (indices 16,17). Col 16 is `8` (Gap). -> **Line Down** from Col 16.\n        *   **Orange Object:**\n            *   Top Side (Row 19): All `8`s. Core `7,7` (indices 22,23) is exposed. -> **Line Up** from Cols 22, 23.\n            *   Right Side (Col 24): Row 20 is `8` (Gap). -> **Line Right** from Row 20.\n    *   **Fully Enclosed Objects:** If the core is completely surrounded by green walls (no gaps), lines extend in **all 4 directions**.\n        *   **Magenta Object:** Surrounded by `3`s on all sides (Rows 13, 16 and Cols 22, 25). -> **Lines Up, Down, Left, Right**.\n            *   Up/Down from Cols 23, 24.\n            *   Left/Right from Rows 14, 15.\n\n3.  **Handle Interactions:**\n    *   Lines stop when they hit another line or object.\n    *   **Magenta Down** (Cols 23,24) meets **Orange Up** (Cols 22,23).\n        *   Col 23: Magenta moves down from Row 16. Orange moves up from Row 19. They meet at Rows 17, 18. Let's fill 17 with Magenta (6) and 18 with Orange (7).\n        *   Col 22: Orange Up fills column.\n        *   Col 24: Magenta Down fills column.\n    *   **Red** Line Up and Left extend to edges.\n    *   **Yellow** Line Right and Down extend to edges.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   **Background:** 8.\n*   **Red Lines:** Col 4 (Rows 0-3) becomes 2. Row 5 (Cols 0-2) becomes 2.\n*   **Yellow Lines:** Row 5 (Cols 19-29) becomes 4. Col 16 (Rows 8-29) becomes 4.\n*   **Magenta Lines:**\n    *   Up: Cols 23,24 (Rows 0-12) become 6.\n    *   Down: Col 24 (Rows 17-29) becomes 6. Col 23 (Row 17) becomes 6.\n    *   Left: Rows 14,15 (Cols 0-21) become 6.\n    *   Right: Rows 14,15 (Cols 26-29) become 6.\n*   **Orange Lines:**\n    *   Up: Col 22 (Rows 0-19) becomes 7. Col 23 (Row 18-19) becomes 7.\n    *   Right: Row 20 (Cols 25-29) becomes 7.\n\nNote: Where lines cross (e.g., Magenta Left crosses Red Up), usually the existing object or a dominant line logic applies. Based on Ex 1, lines stop at other colors.\n*   Magenta Left (Row 14,15) crosses Red Down (Red has no down line). It passes below Red.\n*   Magenta Left crosses Yellow Down (Col 16). Yellow is 4. Magenta is 6. They cross. In Ex 1, different colored lines crossing seemed to overwrite or stop. Let's assume they continue if perpendicular, or stop if head-on. Given the sparsity, they likely just cross (last drawn wins or logical layering). Let's assume Magenta (6) draws over empty space. The Yellow vertical line is at Col 16. Magenta Horizontal at Row 14,15. Intersection (14,16), (15,16).\n*   Magenta Up (Col 23) and Orange Up (Col 23). They are head-on. Magenta ends at 17. Orange ends at 18.\n\nCompleted Grid:\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,7,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nOne detail: Overlaps.\nAt (14,16) and (15,16), Magenta(6) crosses Yellow(4).\nI will preserve the Yellow vertical line as it is \"closer\" (in the test input structure, Yellow is left of Magenta).

Inside these borders, there's another color, which I'll call the \"core color.\" The transformation involves filling gaps in the border and extending \"beams\" of the core color outwards from these filled gaps.\n\n**My Approach:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** I'll begin by locating the rectangular objects within the grid. These are defined by the continuous lines of color 3 (teal).\n2.  **Determine Core Color:** Once I have an object, I'll extract the dominant color within the object's border. That is the color which needs to be beammed.\n3.  **Find Gaps:** The key is finding where the border (color 3) is *incomplete*. I'll compare the \"ideal\" rectangular border dimensions with the actual border. Where there is a discontinuity, I have a gap.\n4.  **Determine Beam Direction:** The beam's direction depends on the gap's position relative to the object's center. Gaps located at corners will send out diagonal beams. Side gaps radiate orthogonal beams.\n5.  **Simulate Beams:** I'll trace these beams until they hit the grid's edge or another object. The beams can block or deflect each other, which is where things get interesting. I should be able to predict the beam path based on its starting point and the directions of the other beams.\n\n**Refinements:**\n\n*   **Collisions:** When beams collide, they can deflect or merge, changing their direction based on a well defined logic. The rules depend on incoming vectors, and the beam will change accordingly.\n*   **Beam Stopping Condition:** Beams will stop either when they reach the edge of the grid or hit an object. This is a very common condition in programming, so I understand this concept very well.\n*   **Chained/Deflected Extension:** This could be the most complex condition. When a beam is deflected, it becomes the new origin for a new beam. This is a very interesting concept.\n\nI have broken down the test input and performed an iterative tracing analysis of the behavior, focusing on these points. My mental model uses vector calculations and a simulation of the beam propagation to solve the problem.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, we must simulate the propagation of \"beams\" of color from specific openings in the \"frames\" present in the grid.\n\n### Analysis of Transformation Rules\n\n1.  **Identify Objects**: Locate rectangular frames bordered by color 3 (green). Each frame encloses a specific interior color $C$.\n    *   The frame definition includes the 3-colored border and the interior region.\n    *   Gaps (color 8) on the perimeter of this frame are the \"sources\" for beams.\n\n2.  **Initialize Beams**:\n    *   Fill each gap with the interior color $C$.\n    *   Determine the beam direction from the gap position relative to the nearest interior pixel of color $C$:\n        *   **Corner Gap**: Beams emit diagonally (NW, NE, SW, SE).\n        *   **Side Gap**: Beams emit orthogonally (N, S, W, E).\n\n3.  **Propagate Beams**:\n    *   Beams travel in straight lines until they encounter an obstacle (grid edge, existing object, or another beam).\n    *   **Collisions/Interactions**:\n        *   **Beam-Beam Deflection**: If a beam hits another beam, it may deflect. \n            *   *Orthogonal hitting Orthogonal* (e.g., North beam hits West beam): The beam deflects into the diagonal sum of the vectors (e.g., N + W = NW).\n            *   *Converging Collision* (e.g., SE beam meets S beam): The beams turn to run parallel/adjacent in the dominant direction (e.g., both go South).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution for Test Input\n\n**1.

It seems like the core concept is about creating beams of color from framed regions. \n\n**First**, I have to identify these framed regions. They look like rectangles bordered by a specific color, but with gaps in the border. The color inside the rectangle is also important - that's the color that will be used for the beam. The background is a consistent color throughout.\n\n**Second**, I noticed the \"gaps\" in the frames are key. These gaps, which are actually sections of the background color within what should be a solid border, are the launch points of the beams.\n\n**Third**, I generate rules:\n1.  **Identify Frames:** It's all about rectangles with borders.\n2.  **Find the Gaps:** Look at the border and see where there are open spots (background color instead of the border).\n3.  **Fill the Gap:** I have to color the gap with the \"inner\" color of the frame.\n4.  **Project Beam:** The main move! From each filled gap, I have to draw a straight line of the inner color outwards. The direction of this beam seems to depend on the gap's location: Top gap is up, Bottom gap is down, etc. I also realized that diagonal beams are used when the gap is in a corner.\n\n**Fourth**, I had to carefully look at examples, especially when a frame's edge or corner had a gap. For example, in Example 1, the corner gaps generated diagonal beams. It was tricky to figure out the exact coordinates and what's meant by an open corner.  Example 2 was a bit easier because it was smaller. I had to pay close attention to the input grid's values!\n\n**Fifth, I considered beam collisions.** Beams seem to have their own rules. They can stop when they hit non-background color cells, existing beams, or even the grid's edge.\n\n**Sixth, I got the test input. It was bigger!** I took my rules and checked that they still work with all the shapes. I also discovered there could be multiple frames. I had to draw everything out to confirm.\n\nI then did what I needed to:\n*   I filled the gaps.\n*   Then, I drew all the beams step-by-step.\n*   I carefully check how beams meet. When the beams meet, one must yield, to avoid errors.\n\nIt takes time, but I think I have it. I need to output based on these instructions!\n\nTo solve this challenge, I will first identify the \"framed regions\" in the input grid. Each frame is bounded by color 3 (green) and contains a solid block of a specific \"inner color\". The transformation involves identifying \"gaps\" (cells of color 8) in the border of these frames, filling them with the inner color, and projecting beams of that color outwards from the gap.\n\n**1. Analyze the Input and Identify Frames:**\n\n*   **Frame 1 (Red, Color 2):**\n    *   **Location:** Rows 4-7, Columns 3-6.\n    *   **Inner Block:** Color 2 at R5-6, C4-5.\n    *   **Gaps in Border:**\n        *   **Top Edge:** R4, C4 is 8. (Action: Beam Up).\n        *   **Left Edge:** R5, C3 is 8. (Action: Beam Left).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner:** R7, C6 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Down-Right).\n\n*   **Frame 2 (Yellow, Color 4):**\n    *   **Location:** Rows 4-7, Columns 15-18.\n    *   **Inner Block:** Color 4 at R5-6, C16-17.\n    *   **Gaps in Border:**\n        *   **Right Edge:** R5, C18 is 8. (Action: Beam Right).\n        *   **Bottom Edge:** R7, C16 is 8. (Action: Beam Down).\n        *   **Top-Right Corner:** R4, C18 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Up-Right).\n\n*   **Frame 3 (Magenta, Color 6):**\n    *   **Location:** Rows 13-16, Columns 22-25.\n    *   **Inner Block:** Color 6 at R14-15, C23-24.\n    *   **Gaps in Border:**\n        *   **Top Edge:** R13, C23 is 8. (Action: Beam Up).\n        *   **Top-Right Corner:** R13, C25 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Up-Right).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner:** R16, C25 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Down-Right).\n\n*   **Frame 4 (Orange, Color 7):**\n    *   **Location:** Rows 20-23, Columns 21-24.\n    *   **Inner Block:** Color 7 at R21-22, C22-23.\n    *   **Gaps in Border:**\n        *   **Right Edge:** R21, C24 is 8. (Action: Beam Right).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner:** R23, C24 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Down-Right).\n\n*   **Frame 5 (Maroon, Color 9):**\n    *   **Location:** Rows 25-28, Columns 0-3.\n    *   **Inner Block:** Color 9 at R26-27, C1-2.\n    *   **Gaps in Border:**\n        *   **Top Edge:** R25, C2 is 8. (Action: Beam Up).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner:** R28, C3 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Down-Right).\n\n**2. Simulate Beam Projections and Resolve Collisions:**\n\nBeams stop when they hit the grid edge or a non-8 cell. Collisions are resolved based on distance from source (first arrival wins).\n\n*   **Collision 1 (R5, C2):**\n    *   **Beam A:** Frame 1 Left Beam (Color 2). Source R5, C3. Distance to C2 is 1.\n    *   **Beam B:** Frame 5 Top Beam (Color 9). Source R25, C2. Distance to R5 is 20.\n    *   **Result:** Beam A arrives first. R5, C2 becomes 2. Beam B stops at R6, C2.\n\n*   **Collision 2 (R5, C23):**\n    *   **Beam A:** Frame 2 Right Beam (Color 4). Source R5, C18. Distance to C23 is 5.\n    *   **Beam B:** Frame 3 Top Beam (Color 6). Source R13, C23. Distance to R5 is 8.\n    *   **Result:** Beam A arrives first. R5, C23 becomes 4. Beam B stops at R6, C23.\n\n*   **Collision 3 (R17, C16):**\n    *   **Beam A:** Frame 1 Diagonal Down-Right (Color 2). Source R7, C6. Distance to (17,16) is 10 steps.\n    *   **Beam B:** Frame 2 Vertical Down (Color 4). Source R7, C16. Distance to R17 is 10 steps.\n    *   **Result:** Simultaneous arrival. Based on similar structures in example solutions, Vertical beams tend to block Diagonal ones. R17, C16 becomes 4. Beam A stops at R16, C15.\n\n**3. Construct Output Grid:**\n\n*   **Background:** 8\n*   **Frame 1 (Color 2):**\n    *   Fill R4 C4. Beam Up: R0-3 C4 -> 2.\n    *   Fill R5 C3. Beam Left: R5 C0-2 -> 2.\n    *   Fill R7 C6. Beam DR: R8 C7 ... R16 C15 -> 2. (Stops at 16,15).\n*   **Frame 2 (Color 4):**\n    *   Fill R5 C18. Beam Right: R5 C19-29 -> 4. (Note: R5 C23 becomes 4).\n    *   Fill R7 C16. Beam Down: R8-29 C16 -> 4. (Note: R17 C16 becomes 4).\n    *   Fill R4 C18. Beam UR: R3 C19, R2 C20, R1 C21, R0 C22 -> 4.\n*   **Frame 3 (Color 6):**\n    *   Fill R13 C23. Beam Up: R12-6 C23 -> 6. (Stops at R6).\n    *   Fill R13 C25. Beam UR: R12 C26, R11 C27, R10 C28, R9 C29 -> 6.\n    *   Fill R16 C25.

the direction is the step from that interior cell toward the opening (one of the 8 compass directions).\n   - Extend the beam outward from the opening, coloring only **8** cells with **X**, stopping at the grid edge or just before a non-8 cell.\n5. **Beam\u2013beam collision rule (seen in Example 3)**:\n   - If two beams would occupy the same cell, that intersection cell stays **8**, both beams stop one step before it, and each continues in a **deflected direction**: rotate its direction **45\u00b0 toward** the other beam\u2019s direction (this creates the characteristic diagonal \u201cturn\u201d patterns).\n\nApplying this to the test grid yields the following output.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n```csv\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8\n2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8\n8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8\n9,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,9,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 26>\n</INPUT_DATA>\n\n<AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\nExecute this pipeline sequentially for every Candidate. You must output your thinking process inside <AUDIT_LOG> tags.\n\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\n- **Selection:** If a Candidate contains multiple <REASONING> blocks, read them all and select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation to audit.\n- **Crystallization:** Convert that text into a strict \"IF-THEN\" algorithm.\n  - *Bad:* \"The pattern involves moving blue pixels.\" (Too vague to audit)\n  - *Good:* \"IF a pixel is Blue, THEN move it 1 step Right. Else, preserve color.\"\n- *Constraint:* If the reasoning is incoherent or vague, mark the Candidate as \"INVALID - VAGUE\".\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT (CRITICAL)\n- You must \"Back-Test\" the Crystallized Rule against the {{SOLVED_EXAMPLES}}.\n- For **EACH** Solved Example pair (Input -> Output), you must strictly perform this 3-step check:\n  1. **Hypothesis:** \"If I apply the Candidate's Rule to this Input, exactly what *should* happen?\"\n  2. **Observation:** \"Look at the actual Official Output. What *actually* happened?\"\n  3. **Verdict:** \"Do they match?\"\n- **Fatal Contradictions to Watch For:**\n  * **Scope Error:** Rule applies to specific colors (e.g., \"Blue\"), but the example changes \"Red\" pixels.\n  * **Geometry Error:** Rule says \"rotate 90,\" but example shows a flip.\n  * **Object Error:** Rule treats pixels individually, but example shows objects moving as blocks.\n- *Constraint:* Record exactly how many Solved Examples the candidate PASSED vs FAILED. **Do not stop at the first failure**; check all examples to determine the severity of the failure (e.g., \"Passed 2/3 Examples\").\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n- For Candidates that survived Phase 2 (or passed at least one example):\n- Look at the {{TEST_INPUT}} and the Candidate's <PROPOSED_SOLUTION> grid.\n- Does the proposed output actually follow the Crystallized Rule?\n- *Common Hallucination:* The text says \"Move Blue,\" but the grid shows Blue staying still.

<CANDIDATE id=\"0\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, the user wants me to solve an ARC task, likely involving some sort of pattern recognition and rule application. I need to analyze a set of solved examples (4) and a single test case to figure out the underlying logic. My initial thought is to break down the task into smaller sub-problems. First, I\u2019ll look at the examples and try to identify repeating structures, patterns, and relationships between the inputs and outputs. I'll pay close attention to any visual cues like colors, shapes, and spatial arrangements. Then, I\u2019ll formalize the rules and test them against the solved cases before applying them to the new test input.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nThis looks promising. I see a 24x24 grid, with some background color (8, teal). There are a few interesting structures here: small boxes. Let's look at the first box: Rows 9-12, Col 3-6.  It has a border (green, 3) and an inner color (maroon, 9). I'll note those coordinates.  The other boxes seem similar (green border with an interior color, different positions/colors). Let's see, there is also a Box with (blue, 1), and then a box (yellow, 4).  I'll compare the input boxes and see what the output is. Ah, the output. I see diagonal lines emanating from these boxes! Not always from the boxes, but radiating outwards. Let\u2019s try to identify how these \"rays\" are generated, I see some sort of diagonal pattern emerging, I will check the position of the box and compare with the output.  The original boxes are still visible but some pixels are replaced with rays. The pixels around the box have been changed! So, the border is there. This is a crucial observation.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s get a little more specific with coordinates, let\u2019s see the maroon (9), the original box pixels are at (10,4), (10,5), (11,4), (11,5). Let\u2019s compare with the output. Hmm, the output 9s appear in diagonal lines. This suggests a direction and distance relationship.  Let\u2019s trace the diagonal lines and compare their coordinate's,  this is probably important. Let's look for a pattern in the distances. Going back to my drawing board.\n\nOkay, it seems like the rays are based on the inner colors, not the outer border.  For this specific case, the inner color (9) is \"projected\" out diagonally in two directions to create the visual rays.  It seems to be filling the background. Ah, the green borders aren\u2019t there, the boxes themselves are still visible, but the background around them has been transformed into a diagonal pattern. Let me check the next one, looking at the blue one (1),  In the output, I\u2019m seeing vertical lines of 1s instead of diagonals. So, each box seems to generate a unique ray pattern! And, it appears the 3s (green) are somewhat irrelevant now. It looks like the rays go from those boxes and stop at a vertical line! This might be a rule.\n\nAh, I think I'm starting to get it. The direction is related to the hole in the border. Let's check the Yellow one (4) and see where the pattern changes in the output to confirm my hypothesis. Here, I see the Yellow one is projected up, but shifts, with the exception of the Magenta, the shift isn't completely vertical, it seems it shifted one step and the output is just a vertical line. Let me keep analyzing the hole and the border.  The output seems to change, is the board an influence? Let's check Ex 1 and confirm, the pattern changes to up vertical at the column 18 and a 3 by side-by-side! The box color influences the shape!\n\n**Formulation of Hypothesis & Rules:**\n\nI\u2019ve got a theory! The \u201cgreen\u201d border acts as a launcher or cannon for \"rays\" of the inner color. The \"missing\" green pixels in the 3x3 box determines the direction. So, corners shoot diagonals.  The \"missing\" ones on the sides, shoot straights! I am pretty sure this is the right direction!\n\n*   Closed Border: No ray or undefined shape!\n*   Missing corner creates a diagonal ray from that corner.\n*   Missing side creates a straight ray.\n\nLet me verify this, with those new hypothesis. I\u2019m starting with the maroon example (9). The corners are missing, the output reflects diagonal projections!  For the blue box, the corners are also missing, and the rays are also diagonals (X-shaped). The yellow one (4) has top and bottom\n\nThe solution involves simulating \"light rays\" emitted from colored boxes.\n\n**Logic:**\n1.  **Sources:** The grid contains several rectangular structures (boxes) defined by green (3) borders. Each box encloses a specific inner color.\n2.  **Emitters:** The green border is not always continuous. \"Holes\" (pixels in the 4x4 perimeter that are not 3, usually 8) act as emitters.\n    -   **Top/Bottom/Left/Right Edge Holes:** Emit straight rays (Vertical/Horizontal) outwards from the hole.\n    -   **Corner Holes:** Emit diagonal rays (45 degrees) outwards from the corner.\n3.  **Beam Color:** The rays consist of the color found inside the box.\n4.  **Interactions:**\n    -   **Solid Objects:** Rays are blocked by the green borders of other boxes.\n    -   **Ray Collisions:**\n        -   **Perpendicular/Crossing:** If a Horizontal ray hits a Vertical ray, the Horizontal ray typically stops (Vertical/Diagonal blocks Horizontal).\n        -   **Diagonal vs Vertical:** If a Diagonal ray intersects a Vertical ray, the Vertical ray is \"pushed\" or shifted sideways to run parallel to the diagonal ray.\n        -   **Diagonal vs Horizontal:** The Diagonal ray blocks the Horizontal ray.\n\n**Rays in Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Red Box (Inner 2):**\n    -   Hole at Top (4,4) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Up (Col 4).\n    -   Hole at Left (5,3) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Left (Row 5).\n    -   Hole at Bottom-Right (7,6) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal BR.\n\n2.  **Yellow Box (Inner 4):**\n    -   Hole at Top-Right (4,18) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal UR.\n    -   Hole at Right (5,18) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Right (Row 5). *Interaction:* Intersection with Magenta Up Ray at Col 23. Horizontal stops. Ray ends at Col 22.\n    -   Hole at Bottom (7,16) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Down (Col 16). *Interaction:* Intersection with Red BR Diagonal Ray at Row 17. The Vertical ray is pushed right by the Diagonal ray. From Row 17 onwards, it shifts to `(r, r)` path (Col = Row).\n\n3.  **Magenta Box (Inner 6):**\n    -   Hole at Top (13,23) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Up (Col 23).\n    -   Hole at Top-Right (13,25) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal UR.\n    -   Hole at Bottom-Right (16,25) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal BR.\n\n4.  **Orange Box (Inner 7):**\n    -   Hole at Right (20,24) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Right (Row 20). *Interaction:* Intersection with Magenta BR Diagonal Ray at Col 29. Horizontal stops at 28.\n    -   Hole at Bottom-Right (22,24) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal BR.\n\n5.  **Maroon Box (Inner 9):**\n    -   Hole at Top (24,3) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Up (Col 3). *Interaction:* Blocked by the bottom of the Red Box at Row 7 (specifically Row 7 Col 3 is a 3). Ray stops at Row 8.\n    -   Hole at Right (25,4) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Right (Row 25). *Interaction:* Intersection with Red BR Diagonal Ray at Col 24. Horizontal stops at 23.\n    -   Hole at Right (26,4) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Right (Row 26). *Interaction:* Intersection with Red BR Diagonal Ray at Col 25. Horizontal stops at 24.\n    -   Hole at Bottom-Right (27,4) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal BR.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,2,4,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,2,4,8,7,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"1\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Analysis and Solution for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given examples and a test input. My job is to figure out the rule and apply it. Let's break this down.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\n*   I'm looking at grids, mainly filled with one color (like blue in the first example), with some small, organized structures embedded within them. These structures are the key.\n*   They seem to be a specific color with a green border. But the border isn't a perfect square. This is important.\n*   The output grids show diagonal lines or \"rays\" originating from these structures, with the color of the inner part of the structure.\n\n**Diving into the Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1**: The first thing I see are these structures with a green, slightly irregular border. Inside, there's a 2x2 block of a different color. My gut tells me these are \"pods\" of some kind.\n    *   I carefully examine the border shape. It looks like a square with the corners removed, which I'll call a \"damaged\" border or broken box.\n    *   The output has lines of the inner color (e.g. 9) extending out diagonally from the pods. The lines seem to follow these directions:\n        *   Each corner of each pod border is a hole.\n\n*   **Example 2**: I'm on the right track, with a smaller grid and only one pod.\n    *   There's also this damaged border with a hole (missing green).\n    *   The output shows a diagonal line, and it's starting where there is a broken border!\n        *   This seems to reinforce the idea that the direction of the lines in the output relates to the shape of the border.\n    *   A bit of further observation about the output indicates that the lines might be related to which parts of the pod is \"missing\" (not 3), and \"rays\" get launched from there, like lights from a lighthouse! The rays' directions change according to the \"missing\" border segments.\n\n*   **Hypothesis Formulation:** I'm starting to get a clear picture. Here's my working hypothesis:\n    1.  **Identify Pods:** Find a 2x2 core of a certain color ($C_{core}$) surrounded by a damaged green border (3).\n    2.  **Hole Detection:** Examine the border. The border should have a full square shape, with all the sides, except for those that have 8 or a similar non-3 value, which defines a *hole*.\n    3.  **Ray Launch:** For each hole, project a line of the inner color $C_{core}$ outwards in a specific direction determined by the position of the hole in the bounding box. Corners move diagonally.\n\n*   I'm testing this hypothesis carefully with Example 2, checking each part of the border. I see the pattern. It's the holes, which act like launch points for rays.\n    *   When the border is broken, with a pixel that is not 3, that defines a direction for the ray.\n\n**Refining the Rule:**\n\n*   I see a difference between a pod, versus a \"damaged\" border.\n    *   A perfect box boundary has corners, and these don't lead to lines, since they are not considered holes.\n\n*   I need a formal definition of a \"hole\" or \"damaged\" position:\n    *   Scan the 4x4 bounding box around the 2x2 core.\n    *   Any boundary pixel that is not a 3 is a *hole*.\n    *   For corner pixels that are non-3, diagonal lines get emitted from that location.\n*   I check my rule against the examples again to confirm. This is making sense!\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Pod Identification:** I'll scan the test input grid and look for 2x2 blocks of colors that aren't 3 or 8. These are my cores.\n2.  **Boundary & Hole Detection:** I draw the 4x4 bounding box around each core, then I'll find all the non-3 values within that border, which defines the hole.\n3.  **Ray Generation:** For each hole, the location defines the start of a ray.\n\nI'm systematically going through the test input:\n\n*   I identify five pods.\n*   For each pod, I carefully analyze the borders, identifying the positions of all the 3's and the non-3's. Non-3's means hole.\n*   The position defines the direction of the ray.\n\n**Conflict Resolution:**\n\n*   What happens when rays cross or overlap\n\nThe transformation involves identifying \"pods\" in the grid and projecting colored lines from them.\n\n**Rules inferred from examples:**\n1.  **Identify Pods:** Look for 4x4 structures that consist of a border of green (3) pixels surrounding a 2x2 core of a distinct color $C$. The border occupies the perimeter of the 4x4 area.\n2.  **Identify Holes:** Examine the 12-pixel border of each 4x4 pod. A \"Hole\" is any pixel in this border that is **not** green (3). In the examples, holes are typically background color (8) or sometimes the core color if the pod is \"damaged\".\n3.  **Project Rays:** For each Hole found:\n    *   Determine the direction of the ray based on the Hole's position relative to the pod's center:\n        *   **Top Edge (non-corner):** Project **Up** (Vertical).\n        *   **Bottom Edge (non-corner):** Project **Down** (Vertical).\n        *   **Left Edge (non-corner):** Project **Left** (Horizontal).\n        *   **Right Edge (non-corner):** Project **Right** (Horizontal).\n        *   **Top-Left Corner:** Project **Up-Left** (Diagonal).\n        *   **Top-Right Corner:** Project **Up-Right** (Diagonal).\n        *   **Bottom-Left Corner:** Project **Down-Left** (Diagonal).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner:** Project **Down-Right** (Diagonal).\n    *   The ray consists of the core color $C$.\n    *   The ray starts at the Hole pixel itself (replacing it with $C$) and continues in the determined direction until it hits the grid edge.\n4.  **Collision Resolution:** If rays from different pods overlap at the same pixel:\n    *   The ray with the **shorter distance to its source** (the hole) takes precedence (Closer wins).\n    *   If distances are equal, a consistent tie-breaking rule applies (in this solution, Vertical lines or Reading Order of the pod seems to take precedence).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nWe identified 5 pods:\n1.  **Pod A (Yellow 4):** Rows 4-7, Cols 14-17.\n    *   Hole at (4,17) [TR] $\\to$ Ray Up-Right.\n    *   Hole at (5,17) [R] $\\to$ Ray Right.\n    *   Hole at (7,15) [B] $\\to$ Ray Down.\n2.  **Pod B (Red 2):** Rows 4-7, Cols 3-6.\n    *   Hole at (4,4) [T] $\\to$ Ray Up.\n    *   Hole at (5,3) [L] $\\to$ Ray Left.\n    *   Hole at (7,6) [BR] $\\to$ Ray Down-Right.\n3.  **Pod C (Pink 6):** Rows 13-16, Cols 22-25.\n    *   Hole at (13,23) [T] $\\to$ Ray Up.\n    *   Hole at (13,25) [TR] $\\to$ Ray Up-Right.\n    *   Hole at (16,25) [BR] $\\to$ Ray Down-Right.\n4.  **Pod D (Orange 7):** Rows 19-22, Cols 21-24.\n    *   Hole at (20,24) [R] $\\to$ Ray Right.\n    *   Hole at (22,24) [BR] $\\to$ Ray Down-Right.\n5.  **Pod E (Maroon 9):** Rows 24-27, Cols 0-3.\n    *   Hole at (24,2) [T] $\\to$ Ray Up.\n    *   Hole at (27,3) [BR] $\\to$ Ray Down-Right.\n\n**Notable Conflicts:**\n*   At `(5,2)`: Ray B (Left, dist 1) vs Ray E (Up, dist 19). Ray B wins (Color 2).\n*   At `(16,15)`: Ray A (Down, dist 9) vs Ray B (Down-Right, dist 9). Ray A wins (Color 4).\n*   At `(20,29)`: Ray C (Down-Right, dist 4) vs Ray D (Right, dist 5). Ray C wins (Color 6).\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"2\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1.

The beam **paints every `8` cell it travels through** with the interior color, continuing step by step.\n\n4. **Beams do not overwrite non-background** (anything not `8`, including the original `3` frames and other colors).\n\n5. **When two beams would step into the same next cell at the same time**, they do not enter that cell.  \n   Instead, they both \u201cdeflect\u201d by updating their directions to the **sign of the sum** of their direction vectors (this produces the kind of diagonal diversion seen in Example 3), and they continue from their current positions.  \n   The contested cell remains `8`.\n\nApplying these rules to the test input yields the following output.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6  \n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8  \n2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8  \n8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8  \n9,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,9,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8\n      2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8\n      8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8\n      9,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,9,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"5\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Task Understanding and Strategy**\n\nMy primary goal is to decipher and reproduce the pattern observed in a series of solved ARC tasks involving grids of integers (0-9). The core seems to be that small shapes/objects (often colored, denoted by the integers within the grid) generate \"trails\" that extend beyond the shape itself, and I need to figure out how these trails are generated, and in a way that handles edge cases and scale variations.\n\n**Early Observations and Hypotheses**\n\n*   **Background and Objects:** The background is typically 8 (teal). The grids have distinct shapes, objects, which are made of a border and a fill. I'm noting the numbers' structure within the objects.\n*   **Initial Trail Direction:** Initial examination hints at diagonal trails (likely North-West) emanating from the shapes. The output also contains the original shapes as a given.\n*   **Edge Wrapping/Boundary Behavior:** It seems that the trails \"wrap\" or reflect when they reach the edges of the grid. But, this has the nuance that the behavior could be based on a grid composed of smaller subgrids, rather than a whole.\n*   **The notion of vertical columns**: The test example hint to vertical segments. The rule may need to be composed of two separate diagonal and vertical parts.\n\n**Refinement and Algorithm**\n\n*   **Panel/Strip Structure:** The grid is divided into vertical \"strips\" of equal width, determined by the grid size and the number and positioning of objects. The trail behavior changes depending on the strip they are in.\n*   **Diagonal Trails:**\n    *   Trails are created at each corner of the inner box.\n    *   They emanate diagonally (Up-Right/Up-Left/Down-Right/Down-Left)\n    *   Each object has an assigned \"Target Column\". When a ray hits an edge of the Panel in which the shape lives, the ray \"jumps\" to a column within another panel:\n        *   Vertical lines are created at an assigned target column which is computed from the object index and position in the Grid.\n\n**Key Components of the Solution**\n\n1.  **Strip Width and Structure:** Determine the width of the repeating panels.\n2.  **Object-Specific Target Columns**:\n    *   Each object \"projects\" to a unique target column, a vertical line in another Panel. The rule for deriving the exact column needs to be made.\n3.  **Ray Tracing (Diagonal and Vertical):**\n    *   Generate rays from each corner of the inner portion of the object.\n    *   Track the ray as they interact with panel boundaries:\n    *   Draw the initial diagonal line; also compute the vertical segment to draw in the assigned target.\n4.  **Edge Wrapping/Panel Transfer**: Identify that a panel end is a boundary to the current panel, and draw the line in the \"target\" column.\n5.  **Output Generation:** The output is constructed by a combination of the input and the generated trails of color.\n\n\nThe task requires inferring a transformation that extends patterns from \"source objects\" (colored shapes) into \"trails\" (lines of the same color). Based on the solved examples, the transformation involves projecting diagonal rays from the corners of the shapes, which then form vertical lines at specific columns.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The 30x30 grid is treated as three vertical \"panels\" or \"strips\" of width 10 (Columns 0-9, 10-19, 20-29).\n2.  **Object Identification:** There are five objects in the test input. We identify them by their unique fill colors and positions:\n    *   **Maroon (9):** Bottom-left, Panel 0 (Center X $\\approx$ 2).\n    *   **Red (2):** Top-left, Panel 0 (Center X $\\approx$ 4).\n    *   **Yellow (4):** Top-middle, Panel 1 (Center X $\\approx$ 15).\n    *   **Orange (7):** Bottom-right, Panel 2 (Center X $\\approx$ 22).\n    *   **Magenta (6):** Middle-right, Panel 2 (Center X $\\approx$ 23).\n3.  **Target Columns:** Each object projects its color to a specific \"Target Column\" where a vertical line forms. The Target Column is determined by the formula:\n    `Target = (Panel_Index + 1) * 10 + Object_Index_In_Panel`\n    *   **Maroon (9):** Panel 0, Index 0 $\\rightarrow$ Target **10**.\n    *   **Red (2):** Panel 0, Index 1 $\\rightarrow$ Target **11**.\n    *   **Yellow (4):** Panel 1, Index 0 $\\rightarrow$ Target **20**.\n    *   **Orange (7):** Panel 2, Index 0 $\\rightarrow$ Target **0** (Wrap $30 \\to 0$).\n    *   **Magenta (6):** Panel 2, Index 1 $\\rightarrow$ Target **1**.\n4.  **Ray Tracing & Vertical Lines:**\n    *   Diagonal rays extend from the four corners of each object's fill area (UL, UR, DL, DR).\n    *   These rays travel until they intersect the object's **Target Column**. The grid wraps horizontally (Column 29 connects to 0).\n    *   From the intersection point:\n        *   **Upward rays (UL, UR):** Create a vertical line from the intersection row **up to the top** (Row 0) in the Target Column.\n        *   **Downward rays (DL, DR):** Create a vertical line from the intersection row **down to the bottom** (Row 29) in the Target Column.\n    *   The diagonal rays themselves are also drawn on the grid until they hit the grid boundary or target.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Col 10 (Maroon 9):** UR ray from (25,3) hits col 10 at row 18. Vertical 0-18. UL ray hits via wrap at row 3. Vertical 0-3. **Result: 9s at 0-18.**\n*   **Col 11 (Red 2):** DR ray from (6,5) hits col 11 at row 12. Vertical 12-29. DL ray hits via wrap at 29. **Result: 2s at 12-29.**\n*   **Col 20 (Yellow 4):** UR ray from (5,16) hits col 20 at row 1. Vertical 0-1. DR ray from (6,16) hits col 20 at row 10.

I've got four examples, and the general gist seems to be about identifying \"objects\" within a grid and then transforming them. The key seems to be these \"objects\" enclosed by a border and then figuring out how to re-create or extend them in the output. I'll need to look at each example carefully, comparing input and output, identifying patterns, and formulating hypotheses. I suspect it involves shapes, colors, and possibly diagonal extensions or patterns. I'll need to carefully analyze the coordinates and numbers. Let's start with Example 1.\n\n**Example 1: Object & Diagonal Beam Identification**\n\nIn Example 1, I see what looks like a teal background, and some objects. There is green and another inside the borders. The inner ones seem to be maroon, blue, yellow, and magenta. The initial impression is that the inner color shapes are re-created in the output, maybe with some kind of modification. The first object has a 2x2 maroon block. In the output, it looks like diagonals of the same color extend from the corners. It looks like it is an \"X\" shape. The X shape appears to have been added to the corners and sides. In example 1, it appears that the corners and sometimes sides are missing in the Input. The beams seem to be in the \"open\" directions. I'll carefully check this.\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation**\n\nIt's looking like the rule is:\n\n1.  **Identify the \"inner color\" block**: It's the enclosed portion within the border.\n2.  **Check for border holes**: Look for missing border pixels on all sides and corners.\n3.  **Create \"beams\"**: Extend lines of the inner color from the border holes.\n\n**Example 2: Further Analysis**\n\nOkay, let's test it in Example 2. It has an intact border. The rule seems to hold. The corners are NOT missing.\n\n**Example 3: Intersection and Refinement**\n\nHere I have a new situation in Example 3. There is an intersection of colors. My initial strategy is to draw the beams but let them overwrite.\nExample 3, there's a red shape and a yellow shape in the middle. Beams were generated and intersected. These created additional beams. It seems like the collision rule is more complex. Beams are generated and may create new shapes. Looking closer at the example, it looks like, in addition to vertical and horizontal beams, a new diagonal beam is generated at intersection points.\nFor the new diagonal beams, it seems to have two orthogonal (horizontal + vertical) beams meeting and creating a diagonal line.\n\n**Example 4: Rule Refinement and Generalization**\n\nExample 4 doesn't have horizontal and vertical parts, but only diagonal. All the corners are not-present (broken). Therefore, if a border is broken, diagonals are generated.\n\n**Final Algorithm and Implementation**\n\n1.  **Detect Objects:** Identify inner color and border, then the 8-connected component to see inner shape\n2.  **For each object**, Check all 8 neighbors (orthogonals and diagonals). Identify shell pixels from inner pixel.\n3.  **Missing border (value != border color) generates beams** :\n    -   Shoot beam of \"inner color\" extending in the empty direction, from the empty shell pixel.\n    -   A missing corner creates a beam at 45 degrees.\n4.  **At Beams and intersections**, no occlusion occurs, just drawing. If beams overlap, the rule is to simply plot all.\n\n**Test Input Analysis and Construction**\nI will create the output for the test grid. This is just applying the rules. I will be very careful to generate beams. I'll start with the base, and then plot the coordinates. I'll finish this carefully and then produce the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify objects defined by a border color (usually 3, green) enclosing an inner color. The transformation involves projecting \"beams\" of the inner color outwards from the object. The direction of these beams is determined by gaps or \"missing pieces\" in the border of the object in the input grid.\n\n**Rules derived from examples:**\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find rectangular blocks of an inner color surrounded by a border (typically color 3).\n2.  **Check Neighbors:** For each cell of the inner block, check its neighbors in the \"border shell\" (Up, Down, Left, Right, and the 4 Diagonals).\n3.  **Project Beams:**\n    *   If an orthogonal neighbor (Up, Down, Left, Right) in the border shell is **missing** (i.e., it is the background color 8 instead of the border color), project a beam of the inner color in that direction (Vertical or Horizontal).\n    *   If a diagonal neighbor (Corner) in the border shell is **missing**, project a diagonal beam of the inner color outwards from that corner.\n4.  **Beam Propagation:** Beams travel in a straight line until the edge of the grid, overwriting the background.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n**Object 1 (Red/2):** Inner block at Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5.\n*   **Missing Top** at (4,4): Beam **UP** (Color 2) at Col 4.\n*   **Missing Top-Right Corner** at (4,6): Beam **UP-RIGHT** (Color 2) starting at (4,6).\n*   **Missing Left** at (5,3): Beam **LEFT** (Color 2) at Row 5.\n*   **Missing Bottom-Right Corner** at (7,6): Beam **DOWN-RIGHT** (Color 2) starting at (7,6).\n\n**Object 2 (Yellow/4):** Inner block at Rows 5-6, Cols 15-16.\n*   **Missing Top-Right Corner** at (4,17): Beam **UP-RIGHT** (Color 4) starting at (4,17).\n*   **Missing Right** at (5,17): Beam **RIGHT** (Color 4) at Row 5.\n*   **Missing Bottom** at (7,15): Beam **DOWN** (Color 4) at Col 15.\n\n**Object 3 (Magenta/6):** Inner block at Rows 14-15, Cols 23-24.\n*   **Missing Top** at (13,23): Beam **UP** (Color 6) at Col 23.\n*   **Missing Top-Right Corner** at (13,25): Beam **UP-RIGHT** (Color 6) starting at (13,25).\n*   **Missing Bottom-Right Corner** at (16,25): Beam **DOWN-RIGHT** (Color 6) starting at (16,25).\n\n**Object 4 (Orange/7):** Inner block at Rows 20-21, Cols 22-23.\n*   **Missing Right** at (20,24): Beam **RIGHT** (Color 7) at Row 20.\n*   **Missing Bottom-Right Corner** at (22,24): Beam **DOWN-RIGHT** (Color 7) starting at (22,24).\n\n**Object 5 (Maroon/9):** Inner block at Rows 25-26, Cols 1-2.\n*   **Missing Top** at (24,2): Beam **UP** (Color 9) at Col 2.\n*   **Missing Bottom-Right Corner** at (27,3): Beam **DOWN-RIGHT** (Color 9) starting at (27,3).\n\nI will now generate the output grid by applying these beams to the input

model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. Each shape has a 3-bordered structure with an interior color (like 9, 4, 6, 7, 2)\n2. The borders have \"gaps\" where 8 appears instead of 3\n3. From each gap, a line extends outward:\n   - Edge gaps: lines extend perpendicular to the edge (horizontal or vertical)\n   - Corner gaps: lines extend diagonally\n4. When lines from different shapes would collide, they run parallel instead of crossing\n\nFor the test input, I identified these shapes and their gaps:\n- Shape 1 (2s): gaps at (4,4)-up, (5,3)-left, (7,6)-diagonal down-right\n- Shape 2 (4s): gaps at (4,14)-diagonal up-left, (5,17)-right, (7,15)-down\n- Shape 3 (6s): gaps at (13,23)-up, (13,25)-diagonal up-right, (16,25)-diagonal down-right\n- Shape 4 (7s): gaps at (20,24)-right, (22,24)-diagonal down-right\n- Shape 5 (9s): gaps at (24,2)-up, (27,3)-diagonal down-right\n\nThe lines extend from these gaps, with shape 1's diagonal becoming parallel to shape 2's vertical when they meet.\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n

  <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred rule from the examples\n\n- **8** is the background.\n- **3** forms a (usually incomplete) **rectangular frame** around a small **interior block** of some other color (the \u201cpayload\u201d color).\n\nFor **each framed object**:\n\n1. **Find the object\u2019s bounding box** (using all non-background cells of that object: the 3\u2019s plus the interior color cells).\n2. Look at the **perimeter cells** of that bounding box. Any perimeter cell that is still **background (8)** is an **opening (a \u201cgap\u201d)** in the frame.\n3. Each gap emits a **ray** of the interior color:\n   - If the gap is on the **top edge**, the ray goes **up**.\n   - **Bottom edge** \u2192 **down**.\n   - **Left edge** \u2192 **left**.\n   - **Right edge** \u2192 **right**.\n   - If the gap is at a **corner**, the ray goes **diagonally outward** from that corner.\n4. The ray **colors the gap cell itself** and then continues cell-by-cell in its direction, **coloring only background (8)** cells, stopping when it would leave the grid or hit a cell that was **already non-background in the original input** (frames/interiors act as blockers).\n5. If two rays claim the same background cell, the cell takes the color of the ray whose **gap is closest (fewest steps along that ray)**; ties are broken by the gap that appears first in reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n\nApplying that to the test input yields the following output grid.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"9\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_3_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nAll examples have:\n- **Background color = 8**\n- **Frame / boundary color = 3**\n- One or more **\u201ccore\u201d colors** (anything that is **not 8 and not 3**, e.g. 2,4,6,7,9).\n\nThe transformation is a **ray-casting / \u201cleaking paint\u201d** rule:\n\n1. **Keep the input exactly as-is** (all 3\u2019s and all core-colored pixels stay).\n2.

When two rays would paint the same background cell, the practical way to match the behavior is:\n   - **Never overwrite a non-8 already painted cell** (so earlier rays keep their color).  \n   (This only matters when rays overlap; most training examples don\u2019t overlap, but the test does.)\n\nThis exactly explains the added straight lines/diagonals in the examples: rays only emerge where a core pixel has a neighboring 8 (a \u201cgap\u201d in the 3-frame), and they travel in that direction until blocked.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid for the test input\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,9,8,8,8  \n8,2,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,9,8,8,8,8  \n2,8,2,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,2,9,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,9,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,4,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,9,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,7  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,7,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,7,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6  \n8,4,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n4,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,9,8,8,8\n      8,2,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,9,8,8,8,8\n      2,8,2,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,2,9,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,9,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,4,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,9,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,7\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,7,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,7,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n      8,4,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"10\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**1. Initial Assessment and Pattern Identification**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at an ARC task, likely involving some kind of transformation on an input grid to produce an output grid. My initial thought process involves breaking down Example 1 to identify patterns. I see that there's a background color (8), and some distinct shapes within it, each with a core color (9, 1, 4, 6) and a border of 3s. The shapes seem to be 4x4 or 4x5 blocks, and I'm noting the positions of these cores in the input relative to the grid. I'm focusing on the input grid's structure.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what each shape is doing. I can see these core colors are inside a ring of 3s, which leaves the corners of the box as 8s.\n\nI notice that the output shows those cores, but there are also what look like diagonal lines emanating from them. And also the corners of the 4x4 or 5 boxes change to the core color.\n\n**2. Refining the Transformation Rule**\n\nAlright, it looks like there's a specific set of rules.\n\nIt appears the process is:\n\n**A. Identify the object:** It's a structure with a 2x2 core of color C, surrounded by a border of 3s. There are missing corners.\n**B. Fill the corners:** Take the corners of the shape, which are usually 8s, and fill them with the core color.\n**C. Emit the beam:** The next step is diagonal projections from the filled corners.\n**D. Interact with the environment:** Diagonal lines that go out from the core's bounding box that intersect grid lines or other shapes.\n\nI start testing to see the behaviour in several shapes of the grid. It looks as though the beam interaction is important.\n\n**3. Applying to the Test Input and Handling Beams and Interactions**\n\nOkay, now let's apply these rules to a new test case. I need to find these shapes first, especially when they overlap. I'll identify the bounding box and the core within it. In my mind, I'm imagining how these lines are going to work based on the rules. I'm imagining them going out, and what will happen when they hit walls or other beams.\n\nI'm imagining where the shapes are. I'll follow the same procedure as before.\n\n**4. Generating the Final Output Grid**\n\nSo, with all the rules sorted out, I feel confident about generating the output grid. I am checking collisions again. I am imagining where all the lines are. I am noting how the lines will go, what color they will be, and where they will stop. I will generate an outline for each section and build up the output grid.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I will apply a transformation rule based on the analysis of the provided examples (1 through 4).\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The grid contains several \"core-border\" shapes. Each shape consists of a 2x2 \"core\" of a specific color $C$, surrounded by a border of color 3 (green). The corners of the shape's rectangular bounding box are initially the background color (8).\n2.  **Fill Corners:** For each identified shape, the four corners of its bounding box are filled with the shape's core color $C$.\n3.  **Emit Diagonal Beams:** From these newly filled corners, beams of color $C$ are emitted outwards into the background.\n    *   **Direction:**\n        *   Shapes in the **top half** of the grid emit beams **upwards** (Up-Left and Up-Right).\n        *   Shapes in the **bottom half** of the grid emit beams **downwards** (Down-Left and Down-Right).\n        *   Shapes in the **middle** of the grid (like the Magenta one in the test input) emit beams in **all four diagonal directions**.\n    *   **Reflection:** If a beam hits the vertical grid boundaries (left or right walls), it reflects at a 90-degree angle (like a billiard ball).\n    *   **Interaction/Termination:**\n        *   If a beam encounters another shape, it connects to it and stops.\n        *   If two beams of different colors are on a collision course to land on the same pixel (head-on collision), they stop one step early and turn vertical (or simply stop), preserving the gap between them. In Example 1, beams 9 and 1 became adjacent and turned vertical. Here, the Red (2) and Yellow (4) top beams would collide at (0,10).

The goal is to figure out the rules that govern the formation of \"beams\" emanating from colored shapes, given a grid with these shapes and an expected output grid. Let's break it down:\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics:** The user wants me to solve this. I see distinct objects in the input. Each object has a core color and a border color (usually teal or a background color). Each object in the input has a central color and a surrounding ring. I'm looking for how this shape maps to \"beams\" on the output grid.\n2.  **Initial Hypothesis:** I start by looking at a number of examples. I see lines with the colors from the object in specific directions. I notice the shapes of the objects vary. They usually have a colored center and border 3 (or the same color of the background).\n3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** My initial intuition is that the direction of the beam is influenced by the shape of the border. I see that border pixel has \"gaps.\"\n4.  **The \"Nozzle\" Hypothesis:** The direction of the beam depends on which parts of the border are open and which parts are closed. Imagine each of the 3s as walls, and gaps are the openings the \"light\" shoots through. If a border pixel is part of the border, the beam is blocked. If an input grid value is the background, it means there is a gap that allows the beam to pass.\n5.  **Examine Corner Cases:** I look at various combinations of shapes. The beams shoot in orthogonal directions and diagonal directions. I look at each example very carefully to build a model that explains where the beams come from based on border geometry.\n6.  **Edge Analysis:** I think of a perimeter or \"border\" for the central core of pixels. This border has orthogonal edge pieces, and 4 corners. Border pixels can be open, closed, or part of a side. Beams can come from gaps or corners.\n7.  **Finalize the Model:** Each object has a specific pattern of open and closed sections that direct the beams. I formalize the rules: open is 8 (background color), a corner is open to diagonal.\n    *   I see a relationship: orthogonal directions come from border pixels, diagonal directions come from corner pixels, where pixels are background pixels.\n8.  **Test and Verify:** I run this model with all examples. It works!\n9.  **Execution Plan:** I map each shape from the initial grid input to its specific beam-launching configuration.\n10. **Test Data Application:** I take the test input, analyze the structure of each object, and create the projected output based on the model.\n11. **Grid Implementation:** I'm careful to address issues such as beam collisions. If overlapping occurs, the earlier beam overwrites the latest beam (or the latest one overrides, based on a pattern or object order, or maybe the source color).\n12. **Final Touches:** I generate the final output and check one last time.\n\nIn essence, it's about carefully interpreting geometric cues to decode the beam directionality rule.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I analyzed the provided examples to understand the relationship between the objects (colored cores surrounded by `3`-colored borders) and the beams of light they emit.\n\n**1. Object Structure:**\nEach object consists of a 2x2 core of a specific color `C`, surrounded by a ring of 12 pixels. The ring is primarily color `3` (green), acting as a \"nozzle\" or \"shield\". The pixels in this ring can be `3` (Closed) or `8` (Open/Background).\n\n**2. Transformation Rule:**\nThe beams emerge from the `Open` pixels (gaps) in the `3`-border. The direction of the beam depends on the position of the gap relative to the 2x2 core.\nMapping the 12 border positions (relative to a 4x4 box where the core is central):\n*   **Corners (TL, TR, BL, BR):** A gap in a corner emits a **Diagonal** beam in that direction.\n    *   Example: Top-Left Corner Gap -> Beam Up-Left.\n*   **Sides (Top, Bottom, Left, Right):** Each side has 2 pixels (e.g., Top-Left side `T1` and Top-Right side `T2`).\n    *   **Right-Half of an Edge (T2, R2, B2, L2):** Emits an **Orthogonal** beam (Up, Right, Down, Left).\n        *   Gap at Top-Right side (`T2`) -> Beam Up.\n        *   Gap at Right-Bottom side (`R2`) -> Beam Right.\n    *   **Left-Half of an Edge (T1, R1, B1, L1):** Emits a **Diagonal** beam or Horizontal/Vertical beam skewed to that side. Based on Examples 3 and 4, these produce beams consistent with the \"Propeller\" or specific diagonal logic:\n        *   Gap at Top-Left side (`T1`) -> Beam **Up-Left**.\n        *   Gap at Right-Top side (`R1`) -> Beam **Up-Right**.\n        *   Gap at Left-Top side (`L1`) -> Beam **Left** (Horizontal).\n        *   Gap at Left-Bottom side (`L2`) -> Beam **Down-Left**.\n\n**3. Applying to Test Input:**\nI identified 4 objects in the test input and applied the logic:\n\n*   **Object 1 (Red `2`, Top-Left):**\n    *   **Gap at T1** (Top edge, left pixel): Emits **Up-Left Diagonal**.\n    *   **Gap at L1** (Left edge, top pixel): Emits **Left Horizontal**.\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow `4`, Top-Right):**\n    *   **Gap at R1** (Right edge, top pixel): Emits **Up-Right Diagonal**.\n    *   **Gap at BL** (Bottom-Left Corner): Emits **Down-Left Diagonal**.\n*   **Object 3 (Green `7`, Middle-Right):**\n    *   **Gap at R1** (Right edge, top pixel): Emits **Up-Right

with intentional gaps and a 2x2 colored interior**\n2. **From each gap, a line extends outward in the interior color:**\n   - Corner gaps \u2192 diagonal lines in that corner's direction\n   - Edge gaps (middle of edge) \u2192 straight lines perpendicular to that edge\n3. **When lines from different shapes would intersect, the intersection cell becomes 8 (empty), but both lines continue past it**\n\nFor the test input, I identified 5 shapes:\n- Shape 1 (2s): gaps at (4,4)\u2192vertical up, (5,3)\u2192horizontal left, (7,6)\u2192diagonal down-right\n- Shape 2 (4s): gaps at (4,14)\u2192diagonal up-left, (5,17)\u2192horizontal right, (7,15)\u2192vertical down\n- Shape 3 (6s): gaps at (13,23)\u2192vertical up, (13,25)\u2192diagonal up-right, (16,25)\u2192diagonal down-right\n- Shape 4 (7s): gaps at (20,24)\u2192horizontal right, (22,24)\u2192diagonal down-right\n- Shape 5 (9s): gaps at (24,2)\u2192vertical up, (27,3)\u2192diagonal down-right\n\nKey intersections create gaps at (5,2), (5,23), (16,15), and (20,29).\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8\n```\n

This ARC task is really about these \"paths\" or \"rays\" that are emitted from the corners of these colorful objects within a grid. My first thought is to understand how these rays are created and how they interact.\n\nI see that the color of these rays seems to depend on the color of the payload within each object. For example, a Maroon object emits Maroon rays. The shapes of these objects don't seem super important, but let's make a mental note about the green frames, like bounding boxes. The key seems to be the color and position of the object, plus how the rays interact.\n\nOkay, in example 1, it looks like rays shoot from the corners and when they meet, something happens. It also seems that there are 4 rays in total, from each corner. It is useful that the rays that emerge from neighboring frames are the same color. And they seem to be diagonal, but if they meet, they bend? Yes, it is the case.\n\nI'm starting to think about this in terms of \"interaction rules\" or \"collision rules.\" When rays from objects *come close*, they modify themselves. They also stop at the border of the grid. It's like a geometric problem. And the problem is about connecting the colored rectangles/objects with these colored rays and how they meet.\n\nThe examples are key. In example 1, I see that lines going to the sides meet, and then go up. And if the objects are close, they meet. If the objects are far, they go to the border, like two diagonal lines.\n\nAlso, the \"staircase\" hint is weird, but it seems that the rays that go diagonal, actually go a diagonal step then horizontal, almost like two rays. Sometimes they meet. The staircase hint must mean something.\n\nLet's look at it from a different angle.\n\nWhat's the relationship between the objects in the example output? Are the rays *connecting* anything? It looks like it.\n\nA more clear rule is coming into focus. Rays will be emitted from the *corners* of a simplified shape such as a bounding box. Then, when the rays meet, a rule applies. Also, the rays are only diagonal.\n\nOkay, if two rays come close, then vertical lines form. If the rays are more separated, they just go diagonally.\n\nLet's look at more examples. The behavior of the rays seems pretty consistent. When rays of the same color are next to one another, they combine.\n\nLet's summarize.\nFor now, the rules are:\n1.  From the objects, rays extend to the border of the image, the color of which matches the center object.\n2.  If two rays meet, they turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n\nIt seems to be all about the edges and corners of the objects and how they interact. If the objects don't interact, the lines will go to the side.\n\nOkay, let's look at example 2, 3 and 4 again.\n\nThis \"Test Input\" is helpful. I see how all the rays interact in different parts of the graph. Horizontal rays interact to make a straight horizontal line, vertical rays combine to make a straight horizontal line and diagonal rays continue without intersection to the border.\n\nNow, I think I have enough information to solve this and make a proper summary.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I identified the following rules based on the examples:\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The input contains objects defined by green (`3`) frames enclosing a core of a different color (the \"payload\"). The green frame marks the object's boundary.\n2.  **Ray Emission**: Each of the four corners of an object's bounding box emits a diagonal ray in the color of the payload.\n    *   Top-Left (TL) corner emits a ray Up-Left.\n    *   Top-Right (TR) corner emits a ray Up-Right.\n    *   Bottom-Left (BL) corner emits a ray Down-Left.\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR) corner emits a ray Down-Right.\n3.  **Ray Propagation & Interaction**:\n    *   Rays travel diagonally until they hit the grid border or interact with another ray.\n    *   **Horizontal Interaction**: If two objects are horizontally aligned (or close), their facing rays (e.g., UR of the left object and UL of the right object) converge. When they meet or become adjacent, they turn **vertical**.\n        *   Top rays turn Vertical Up.\n        *   Bottom rays turn Vertical Down.\n        *   The vertical lines run parallel if the gap allows, effectively extending from the convergence point to the grid edge.\n    *   **Vertical Interaction**: If two objects are vertically aligned, their facing rays (e.g., DL of the top object and UL of the bottom object) converge. When they meet or become adjacent, they turn **horizontal**.\n        *   Left-side rays turn Horizontal Left.\n        *   Right-side rays turn Horizontal Right.\n4.  **No Interaction**: Rays that do not encounter a matching ray from another object continue straight diagonally to the grid border.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Object 1 (Red, 2)**: Top-Left region (Row 4-7, Col 3-6).\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow, 4)**: Top-Right region (Row 4-7, Col 14-17).\n    *   **Interaction**: These form a horizontal pair.\n    *   **Top**: Red UR and Yellow UL converge at the top border (Col 10). Diagonal lines drawn to meet there.\n    *   **Bottom**: Red DR and Yellow DL converge below the objects. They turn vertical downwards at Row 10, running down Columns 9 and 11 respectively.\n*   **Object 3 (Magenta, 6)**: Middle-Right (Row 13-16, Col 22-25).\n*   **Object 4 (Orange, 7)**: Bottom-Right (Row 19-22, Col 21-24).\n    *   **Interaction**: These form a vertical pair.\n    *   **Left**: Magenta DL and Orange UL converge between the objects (Row 17/18). They turn Horizontal Left. Magenta's ray runs Left on Row 17. Orange's ray runs Left on Row 18.\n    *   **Right**: Magenta DR and Orange UR converge. They turn Horizontal Right on Row 17 (Magenta) and Row 18 (Orange).\n*   **Object 5 (Maroon, 9)**: Bottom-Left (Row 24-27, Col 0-3).\n    *   **Isolated**: No nearby objects for interaction. All 4 rays travel diagonally to the borders.\n\n**Generated Output Grid:**\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,2,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,2,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,6,0,0,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,6,0,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,6,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,3,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,3,7,7,8,8,7,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,7,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,7,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n3,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,9,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,7,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,9,8,8,2,8,4,8,7,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,9,8,2,8,4,7,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      8,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      8,8,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,2,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      8,8,8,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      8,8,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,2,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,6,0,0,0\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,6,0,0\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,6,0\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,3,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,3,7,7,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,7,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,7,8\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      3,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,9,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,7,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,9,8,8,2,8,4,8,7,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,8,8,8,8,9,8,2,8,4,7,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"16\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Detailed Pathfinding Logic for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out.  The goal is to analyze these ARC tasks, figure out how they work and then generate the correct output.  I'll break this down:\n\n**1.  Initial Observations & Goal:** The user wants me to solve these ARC puzzles based on examples. I need to analyze how the *inputs* (cyan background, green \"frame-like\" objects with color payloads) translate into the *outputs* (which have paths drawn).\n\n**2.  Pattern Recognition:** I\u2019m noticing there's a specific pattern:\n\n    *   **Frame Structure:** The green frames mark the area where the path should emerge, but the actual path *doesn't* use green.\n    *   **Payload Colors:** There's a color \u201cpayload\u201d *inside* the green frame and that dictates the color of the path drawn.\n    *   **Hole Detection:** Where the frame is not *completely* closed - usually at corners/gaps - determines how the path starts and its initial direction! I kept thinking it was the entire shape of the green frame, but that's not it. It's about where the frame *stops*.\n    *   **Line Extension:** Once a *hole* is detected, the path \u201cleaks\u201d out. The direction the path goes appears to correspond to the *neighboring* cells of the payload. It\u2019s a neighbor \u201ccheck\u201d.\n    *   **Grid Boundaries:** The paths extend to the borders of the grid.  Sometimes these go through a \u201cstaircase\u201d diagonal.\n\n**3.  Important Insights:**\n\n    *   **Coordinate system/Indices:** I re-read carefully, because it's easy to make mistakes with this kind of data!\n    *   **Vector Rules:** So far, it looks like a neighbor check to determine \"holes\" in the grid.\n    *   **Diagonal Paths vs. Shift:** I've had to throw out the simple idea of \"perfect diagonals\" because they don't apply, *always*.\n    *   **Overlapping Paths:** I will take into account *overlapping* path cells, just to be precise.  These will *not* be a problem though.\n\n**4.  Test Input Analysis (Most Important Part):** I'll use a test input to confirm everything. I'm going to determine \"holes\", vector rules and directions.\n\n**5.  Output Generation Process:** I\u2019ll now go through all the objects in the test input, identify the \"Hole\", the path vector (based on the neighboring cells) and generate all of the coordinates for the path. I won't *overwrite* any existing *non-8* values, which means objects *won't* have paths drawn *over* them. I'll need a *string-based* output format to represent this.\n\n**6.  Final Coordinate Generation:** I'll map all the individual coordinate points I found and I'll build the output string, which will now have the paths added.\n\nI believe this is all the logic. I can see I've double checked for all possible errors.\n\n\nThe task requires identifying \"objects\" in the grid (defined by green frames containing colored payloads) and extending \"paths\" from them. Based on the analysis of the solved examples, the rule for generating these paths is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Each object consists of a green (3) frame surrounding a 2x2 block of \"payload\" pixels (other colors like 9, 1, 4, 6, 2, 7).\n2.  **Locate \"Holes\":** Examine the 8 immediate neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) of each pixel in the 2x2 payload.\n    *   If a neighbor is a background pixel (8) (i.e., there is a gap in the green frame), it is considered a \"Hole\".\n3.  **Extend Paths:** For each payload pixel with a neighboring Hole, draw a path starting from that Hole.\n    *   **Color:** The path takes the color of the payload.\n    *   **Direction:** The direction is defined by the vector from the Payload pixel to the Hole pixel.\n        *   Example: If the Hole is directly above the Payload pixel, the path goes vertically UP.\n        *   Example: If the Hole is diagonally down-right from the Payload pixel, the path goes diagonally DOWN-RIGHT.\n    *   **Length:** The path extends in a straight line until it hits the grid boundary.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Object 1 (Red 2, Top-Left):**\n    *   Hole at `(4,4)` (Top of Payload `(5,4)`). Vector: UP. Path: Red vertical line at column 4 from row 3 to 0.\n    *   Hole at `(5,3)` (Left of Payload `(5,4)`). Vector: LEFT. Path: Red horizontal line at row 5 from column 2 to 0.\n    *   Hole at `(7,6)` (Down-Right of Payload `(6,5)`). Vector: DOWN-RIGHT. Path: Red diagonal line starting at `(8,7)`.\n\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow 4, Top-Right):**\n    *   Hole at `(5,17)` (Right of Payload `(5,16)`). Vector: RIGHT. Path: Yellow horizontal line at row 5 from column 18 to 29.\n    *   Hole at `(7,15)` (Down of Payload `(6,15)`). Vector: DOWN.

Each input contains \"frame\" objects made of 3s (green) with a colored \"payload\" inside\n2. Gaps in the frames indicate where paths should emanate from\n3. Paths are drawn using the payload color:\n   - Top edge gaps \u2192 paths go upward\n   - Bottom edge gaps \u2192 paths go downward  \n   - Left edge gaps \u2192 paths go leftward\n   - Right edge gaps \u2192 paths go rightward\n   - Corner gaps \u2192 diagonal paths in that direction\n4. Paths extend to grid boundaries\n5. Original frames and payloads are preserved\n\n**Analyzing the test input frames:**\n\n- **Frame 1** (rows 4-7, cols 3-6, payload=2): Gaps at (4,4) top, (5,3) left, (7,6) bottom-right corner\n- **Frame 2** (rows 4-7, cols 14-17, payload=4): Gaps at (4,14) top-left corner, (5,17) right, (7,15) bottom\n- **Frame 3** (rows 13-16, cols 22-25, payload=6): Gaps at (13,23) top, (13,25) & (16,25) corners\n- **Frame 4** (rows 19-22, cols 21-24, payload=7): Gaps at (20,24) & (22,24) right side\n- **Frame 5** (rows 24-27, cols 0-3, payload=9): Gaps at (24,2) top, (27,3) bottom-right corner\n\n**Drawing paths from each gap:**\n- 9 (Frame 5): vertical up col 2, diagonal down-right from (27,3)\n- 2 (Frame 1): vertical up col 4, horizontal left row 5, diagonal down-right from (7,6)\n- 4 (Frame 2):

\u201cframes\u201d**, each enclosing a small solid **payload** of some other color (not 3 and not 8).\n\nFor each framed object:\n\n1. **Find the payload**: the non-(8,3) cells inside the green frame (typically a 2\u00d72 block).\n2. **Find \u201cexits\u201d around the payload**:  \n   For every payload cell, look at its **8 neighboring cells**.  \n   Any neighbor that is **background (8)** is an exit, and it defines a direction from the payload cell to that neighbor (one of the 8 compass directions).\n3. **Draw a thin ray/path in the payload color** starting from that neighboring background cell and continuing step-by-step in the same direction:\n   - Paint only on background (8).\n   - Stop when the next step would leave the grid or hit a non-background cell (including green frames, payloads, or already-drawn paths).\n4. Keep all original cells unchanged; only add these new colored paths.\n\n(When multiple objects exist, earlier-drawn paths can block later ones; this naturally creates endpoints/junctions.)\n\n---\n\n### Completed output grid\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"19\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Identify each \u201csource object\u201d**  \n   The input uses:\n   -

Continue until you would leave the grid **or** the next cell is **not background 8** (do not overwrite existing non-8 cells; stopping here creates \u201cjunctions\u201d).\n\n4. **Keep all original pixels** (frames and payloads) unchanged; only add new path pixels.\n\nApplied to the test grid, this produces paths for the payload colors **2, 4, 6, 7, 9** from their respective frame openings.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_8_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the examples)\n\n**Background** is color **8**.

On the **border of that bounding box**, locate every cell that is **background (8)**.  \n   These are the device\u2019s **exits/openings**.\n3. For each opening, determine the **shoot direction** from its position on the bounding box border:\n   - top edge \u2192 shoot **up**\n   - bottom edge \u2192 shoot **down**\n   - left edge \u2192 shoot **left**\n   - right edge \u2192 shoot **right**\n   - corners shoot diagonally outward (e.g. top-left \u2192 up-left, bottom-right \u2192 down-right, etc.)\n4. **Draw a ray** of the device\u2019s core color starting at the opening cell and continuing step-by-step in that direction:\n   - paint cells while they are **still background (8)**\n   - **stop** just before the ray would enter a non\u20118 cell (original structure or previously drawn ray)\n5. To match interactions seen in the examples, process devices in **increasing core color** order; earlier rays block later ones.\n\nApplying this to the test grid yields the following output.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_7_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nEach \u201cobject\u201d has:\n- a **background** color (here `8`),\n- a **frame/border** color (`3`), and\n- a **solid 2\u00d72 core** of some other color (e.g. `2,4,6,7,9`).\n\nFor **each object**, the output draws **straight \u201crays\u201d** of the core color out into the background:\n\n1. **Find the core**: a connected component of some color `c != 8` and `c != 3` (in these tasks it is a 2\u00d72 block).\n2. **Find \u201cexits\u201d**: look at all cells in the **8-neighborhood** of the core. Any neighbor cell that is still **background `8`** is an exit.\n3. **Determine the ray direction** for each exit:\n   - Choose an adjacent core cell that touches the exit with **minimum Manhattan distance** (so orthogonal adjacency is preferred over diagonal if both exist).\n   - The direction is the step `(dr, dc)` from that core cell to the exit cell (one of the 8 directions).\n4. **Draw the ray**: starting at the exit cell, repeatedly step by `(dr,dc)` and recolor background `8` cells to the core color until you would leave the grid or hit a non-`8` cell (frames/cores/previous rays block further extension).\n\nApply this to all objects in the grid.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"D\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_6_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n1.

The user wants me to figure out a pattern from a set of solved examples to apply to a new input. It looks like we're dealing with grids of numbers that represent colored shapes. The primary goal is to predict the output grid based on the input.\n\n**Initial Observations**\n\nThe background is a teal color, and we have smaller colored structures, possibly squares or partial squares, with a central core of a different color. The key seems to be the relationship between the shapes of these colored structures in the input and the pattern of colored lines in the output. The structures have borders that contain gaps.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1.  **Structure of the Example**: Let's examine a specific example. We see a green border (color 3) surrounding a core of a different color. The gaps in these green borders seem crucial. It appears that the output lines emanate from these gaps.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis: Gap-Driven Line Generation**: Maybe the gaps in the border point to the direction of the lines. If there's no green pixel blocking a direction, a line of the core color \"shoots out\". For a 2x2 core: A core at (r,c), (r,c+1), (r+1,c), (r+1,c+1). The green pixels are at (r-1,c), (r-1,c+1), (r,c-1), (r,c+2), (r+1,c-1), (r+1,c+2), (r+2,c), (r+2,c+1). The \"gaps\" are the four corners of the border (r-1,c-1), (r-1,c+2), (r+2,c-1), (r+2,c+2). This \"gap hypothesis\" checks out for the first input. The output lines are in the diagonal direction of the gaps.\n\n3.  **Color Matters**: However, the example of a blue and maroon shape of the same geometry produces a different output. The color of the core must influence the output behavior. So, is there an odd/even correlation? Not apparent. This might mean we need a lookup table for the colors.\n\n4.  **Blue Exception**: The blue core shape with the same border geometry has vertical and horizontal output lines. Something is different with the Blue core. It might \"permeate\" the borders and be the exception. In fact, if we look at the image, Blue's corners are closed with green, while Maroon is open at the same locations. So the rule \"Shoot through Gap\" becomes \"Shoot through Wall\", so Blue and the shape produces lines perpendicular to the green pixels that close the geometry of the core.\n\n5.  **Revising the Hypothesis (Wall/Gap Shooter)**:\n    *   I'll call Blue a \"wall shooter\" (shooting through walls or green pixels) and all other cores are \"gap shooters\".\n    *   If color is blue, shoot a beam in the neighbor's location if it has a green pixel.\n    *   If color is not blue, shoot a beam in the neighbor's location if it has an empty pixel.\n\n6.  **Refinement - Granular \"Gap Shooter\"**: The initial model had gaps defined at the corner pixels. Instead, each individual pixel of the 2x2 core checks all outward-facing neighbors. For the Top-Left of Core: Up, Left, Up-Left. (and same thing with core's Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right)\n    *   **Blue cores**: The presence of green neighbors triggers beam generation. (Wall Shooter).\n    *   **Non-Blue cores**: The presence of empty neighbors triggers beam generation. (Gap Shooter).\n\n7.  **Final Model Verification**:\n    *   Using this hypothesis, apply it to the new input.\n    *   Scan the input grid for cores. The coordinates become available.\n    *   Identify the four 12 neighbors.\n    *   Apply the Blue exception. For Blue cores (color 1), a beam radiates in the direction of any green neighbor. For any other core, a beam radiates in the direction of empty space.\n    *   Draw the beams. If there is a \"collision\", overwrite (I'll assume a \"first come first serve\" rule or whatever the system's rule is for conflicts).\n\nThe final step will be to implement this approach on the example to see if all example outputs become reproducible with the proposed model.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rule is determined by the \"green casing\" (pixels of color 3) surrounding the 2x2 core of each object. The core color itself determines the color of the emitted beams, but the **direction** of the beams is determined by the **gaps** in the green casing.\n\n**Rule:**\n1.  Identify each object consisting of a 2x2 core of a unique color surrounded by green (3) pixels.\n2.  For each of the 4 pixels making up the 2x2 core, check its immediate outward-facing neighbors in the surrounding 1-pixel wide ring (orthogonal and diagonal).\n    *   **Top-Left Core Pixel**: Check Up, Left, and Up-Left neighbors.\n    *   **Top-Right Core Pixel**: Check Up, Right, and Up-Right neighbors.\n    *   **Bottom-Left Core Pixel**: Check Down, Left, and Bottom-Left neighbors.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Core Pixel**: Check Down, Right, and Bottom-Right neighbors.\n3.  If a neighbor is \"Open\" (color 8), a beam of the core's color is emitted in that direction.\n4.  The beam travels in a straight line until it hits the edge of the grid or another object.\n    *   **Exception**: If the core is Blue (1), it emits beams through the *Walls* (where the neighbor is 3) instead of gaps. However, there are no Blue cores in the test input.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Red Object (Color 2)** at R5-6, C4-5:\n    *   **Up**: The neighbor at R4, C4 is 8 (Open). **Beam Up**.\n    *   **Left**: The neighbor at R5, C3 is 8 (Open). **Beam Left**.\n    *   Other directions are blocked by 3s.\n\n2.  **Yellow Object (Color 4)** at R5-6, C15-16:\n    *   **Up-Left (NW)**: The neighbor at R4, C14 is 8 (Open). **Beam NW**.\n    *   **Right**: The neighbor at R5, C17 is 8 (Open). **Beam Right**.\n    *   **Down**: The neighbor at R7, C15 is 8 (Open). **Beam Down**.\n    *   Other directions are blocked.\n\n3.  **Magenta Object (Color 6)** at R14-15, C23-24:\n    *   **Up**: The neighbor at R13, C23 is 8 (Open). **Beam Up**.\n    *   **Up-Right (NE)**: The neighbor at R13, C25 is 8 (Open). **Beam NE**.\n    *   **Down-Right (SE)**: The neighbor at R16, C25 is 8 (Open). **Beam SE**.\n    *   Note: The SW corner at R16, C22 is 3 (Blocked).\n\n4.  **Orange Object (Color 7)** at R20-21, C22-23:\n    *   **Right**: The neighbor at R20, C24 is 8 (Open). **Beam Right**.\n    *   **Down-Right (SE)**: The neighbor at R22, C24 is 8 (Open). **Beam SE**.\n\n5.  **Maroon Object (Color 9)** at R25-26, C1-2:\n    *   **Up**: The neighbor at R24, C2 is 8 (Open). **Beam Up**.\n    *   **Down-Right (SE)**: The neighbor at R27, C3 is 8 (Open). **Beam

I'm seeing a pattern: the grids have a teal background, and small objects are popping up, each with a colored core enclosed by a green border. My first instinct is to try and define the object's structure, focusing on a typical object. It seems the green border isn't always a complete box; there are gaps. I want to nail down how those gaps affect the solution.\n\nI'm specifically looking at the relationships between the colors. My mind keeps flipping between individual objects, considering their position, and trying to trace the lines in relation to gaps and corners. In Example 1, I find the core of each object and then analyze the color layout. I can clearly see a circular layout with gaps in certain places. From looking, a gap in the green box leads to a projection of a line, but I can also see examples where there are no gaps but there still is projection.\n\nI am reevaluating the nature of 'gaps,' and I think the concept of 'walls' might provide an important concept in understanding this puzzle. I realize the structure of these lines is important, but how it emerges is much more fascinating. Now I know that, when fully enclosed, the lines originate outwards in all directions.\n\nIn Example 2, the grid has a yellow, 2x2 structure with different border colors. There is a gap at the top and the right, which creates an obvious line. These two experiments provide a pattern for the relationship between border gaps and the outward flow of colored lines. This proves that, when there is a lack of a wall, that line extends outward.\n\nNow I am going back, reevaluating the previous example images, and noticing diagonal lines. Looking at the yellow structure, I can see the lines are vertical and horizontal. It isn't random. The images are a perfect application of what I have discovered, so far.\n\nMy new hypothesis: *Lines emerge from the core color through gaps.*\n\nI've tested this hypothesis, but I noticed something was inconsistent with previous evidence. I am noticing that when two different lines encounter each other, they stop at the boundary where they intersect.\n\nI'm not so sure. Some of the test cases aren't working as well with my rules as I had hoped. The best approach is to examine each element of the layout: 1. Find all green, 2. Identify inner colored pixels, 3. find openings, and 4. draw the lines.\n\nIn the test case, I am seeing three objects. The red core is partially enclosed; the yellow core is enclosed with gaps on the side; the magenta is fully enclosed. All of these factors will influence how the object generates lines. The lines are also able to collide. I am confident I have all the pieces I need to write my solution.\n\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying colored objects enclosed in green borders and extending lines of the object's core color outwards.\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all objects consisting of a core of a specific color (not 8 or 3) surrounded by a green (3) border or partially surrounded.\n    *   **Red Object:** Core (2) at Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5.\n    *   **Yellow Object:** Core (4) at Rows 5-6, Cols 16-17.\n    *   **Magenta Object:** Core (6) at Rows 14-15, Cols 23-24.\n    *   **Orange Object:** Core (7) at Rows 20-21, Cols 22-23.\n\n2.  **Determine Line Directions:**\n    *   **Partially Enclosed Objects:** Lines extend from the core through any **gaps** (8s) in the immediate 4-neighbor green border.\n        *   **Red Object:**\n            *   Top Side (Row 4): Pattern `3, 8` above core `2, 2` (indices 4,5). Col 4 is `8` (Gap). -> **Line Up** from Col 4.\n            *   Left Side (Col 3): Pattern `8, 3` left of core `2, 2` (rows 5,6). Row 5 is `8` (Gap). -> **Line Left** from Row 5.\n        *   **Yellow Object:**\n            *   Right Side (Col 18): Pattern `8, 3` right of core `4, 4` (rows 5,6). Row 5 is `8` (Gap). -> **Line Right** from Row 5.\n            *   Bottom Side (Row 7): Pattern `8, 3` below core `4, 4` (indices 16,17). Col 16 is `8` (Gap). -> **Line Down** from Col 16.\n        *   **Orange Object:**\n            *   Top Side (Row 19): All `8`s. Core `7,7` (indices 22,23) is exposed. -> **Line Up** from Cols 22, 23.\n            *   Right Side (Col 24): Row 20 is `8` (Gap). -> **Line Right** from Row 20.\n    *   **Fully Enclosed Objects:** If the core is completely surrounded by green walls (no gaps), lines extend in **all 4 directions**.\n        *   **Magenta Object:** Surrounded by `3`s on all sides (Rows 13, 16 and Cols 22, 25). -> **Lines Up, Down, Left, Right**.\n            *   Up/Down from Cols 23, 24.\n            *   Left/Right from Rows 14, 15.\n\n3.  **Handle Interactions:**\n    *   Lines stop when they hit another line or object.\n    *   **Magenta Down** (Cols 23,24) meets **Orange Up** (Cols 22,23).\n        *   Col 23: Magenta moves down from Row 16. Orange moves up from Row 19. They meet at Rows 17, 18. Let's fill 17 with Magenta (6) and 18 with Orange (7).\n        *   Col 22: Orange Up fills column.\n        *   Col 24: Magenta Down fills column.\n    *   **Red** Line Up and Left extend to edges.\n    *   **Yellow** Line Right and Down extend to edges.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   **Background:** 8.\n*   **Red Lines:** Col 4 (Rows 0-3) becomes 2. Row 5 (Cols 0-2) becomes 2.\n*   **Yellow Lines:** Row 5 (Cols 19-29) becomes 4. Col 16 (Rows 8-29) becomes 4.\n*   **Magenta Lines:**\n    *   Up: Cols 23,24 (Rows 0-12) become 6.\n    *   Down: Col 24 (Rows 17-29) becomes 6. Col 23 (Row 17) becomes 6.\n    *   Left: Rows 14,15 (Cols 0-21) become 6.\n    *   Right: Rows 14,15 (Cols 26-29) become 6.\n*   **Orange Lines:**\n    *   Up: Col 22 (Rows 0-19) becomes 7. Col 23 (Row 18-19) becomes 7.\n    *   Right: Row 20 (Cols 25-29) becomes 7.\n\nNote: Where lines cross (e.g., Magenta Left crosses Red Up), usually the existing object or a dominant line logic applies. Based on Ex 1, lines stop at other colors.\n*   Magenta Left (Row 14,15) crosses Red Down (Red has no down line). It passes below Red.\n*   Magenta Left crosses Yellow Down (Col 16). Yellow is 4. Magenta is 6. They cross. In Ex 1, different colored lines crossing seemed to overwrite or stop. Let's assume they continue if perpendicular, or stop if head-on. Given the sparsity, they likely just cross (last drawn wins or logical layering). Let's assume Magenta (6) draws over empty space. The Yellow vertical line is at Col 16.

Inside these borders, there's another color, which I'll call the \"core color.\" The transformation involves filling gaps in the border and extending \"beams\" of the core color outwards from these filled gaps.\n\n**My Approach:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** I'll begin by locating the rectangular objects within the grid. These are defined by the continuous lines of color 3 (teal).\n2.  **Determine Core Color:** Once I have an object, I'll extract the dominant color within the object's border. That is the color which needs to be beammed.\n3.  **Find Gaps:** The key is finding where the border (color 3) is *incomplete*. I'll compare the \"ideal\" rectangular border dimensions with the actual border. Where there is a discontinuity, I have a gap.\n4.  **Determine Beam Direction:** The beam's direction depends on the gap's position relative to the object's center. Gaps located at corners will send out diagonal beams. Side gaps radiate orthogonal beams.\n5.  **Simulate Beams:** I'll trace these beams until they hit the grid's edge or another object. The beams can block or deflect each other, which is where things get interesting. I should be able to predict the beam path based on its starting point and the directions of the other beams.\n\n**Refinements:**\n\n*   **Collisions:** When beams collide, they can deflect or merge, changing their direction based on a well defined logic. The rules depend on incoming vectors, and the beam will change accordingly.\n*   **Beam Stopping Condition:** Beams will stop either when they reach the edge of the grid or hit an object. This is a very common condition in programming, so I understand this concept very well.\n*   **Chained/Deflected Extension:** This could be the most complex condition. When a beam is deflected, it becomes the new origin for a new beam. This is a very interesting concept.\n\nI have broken down the test input and performed an iterative tracing analysis of the behavior, focusing on these points. My mental model uses vector calculations and a simulation of the beam propagation to solve the problem.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, we must simulate the propagation of \"beams\" of color from specific openings in the \"frames\" present in the grid.\n\n### Analysis of Transformation Rules\n\n1.  **Identify Objects**: Locate rectangular frames bordered by color 3 (green). Each frame encloses a specific interior color $C$.\n    *   The frame definition includes the 3-colored border and the interior region.\n    *   Gaps (color 8) on the perimeter of this frame are the \"sources\" for beams.\n\n2.  **Initialize Beams**:\n    *   Fill each gap with the interior color $C$.\n    *   Determine the beam direction from the gap position relative to the nearest interior pixel of color $C$:\n        *   **Corner Gap**: Beams emit diagonally (NW, NE, SW, SE).\n        *   **Side Gap**: Beams emit orthogonally (N, S, W, E).\n\n3.  **Propagate Beams**:\n    *   Beams travel in straight lines until they encounter an obstacle (grid edge, existing object, or another beam).\n    *   **Collisions/Interactions**:\n        *   **Beam-Beam Deflection**: If a beam hits another beam, it may deflect. \n            *   *Orthogonal hitting Orthogonal* (e.g., North beam hits West beam): The beam deflects into the diagonal sum of the vectors (e.g., N + W = NW).\n            *   *Converging Collision* (e.g., SE beam meets S beam): The beams turn to run parallel/adjacent in the dominant direction (e.g., both go South).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution for Test Input\n\n**1.

It seems like the core concept is about creating beams of color from framed regions. \n\n**First**, I have to identify these framed regions. They look like rectangles bordered by a specific color, but with gaps in the border. The color inside the rectangle is also important - that's the color that will be used for the beam. The background is a consistent color throughout.\n\n**Second**, I noticed the \"gaps\" in the frames are key. These gaps, which are actually sections of the background color within what should be a solid border, are the launch points of the beams.\n\n**Third**, I generate rules:\n1.  **Identify Frames:** It's all about rectangles with borders.\n2.  **Find the Gaps:** Look at the border and see where there are open spots (background color instead of the border).\n3.  **Fill the Gap:** I have to color the gap with the \"inner\" color of the frame.\n4.  **Project Beam:** The main move! From each filled gap, I have to draw a straight line of the inner color outwards. The direction of this beam seems to depend on the gap's location: Top gap is up, Bottom gap is down, etc. I also realized that diagonal beams are used when the gap is in a corner.\n\n**Fourth**, I had to carefully look at examples, especially when a frame's edge or corner had a gap. For example, in Example 1, the corner gaps generated diagonal beams. It was tricky to figure out the exact coordinates and what's meant by an open corner.  Example 2 was a bit easier because it was smaller. I had to pay close attention to the input grid's values!\n\n**Fifth, I considered beam collisions.** Beams seem to have their own rules. They can stop when they hit non-background color cells, existing beams, or even the grid's edge.\n\n**Sixth, I got the test input. It was bigger!** I took my rules and checked that they still work with all the shapes. I also discovered there could be multiple frames. I had to draw everything out to confirm.\n\nI then did what I needed to:\n*   I filled the gaps.\n*   Then, I drew all the beams step-by-step.\n*   I carefully check how beams meet. When the beams meet, one must yield, to avoid errors.\n\nIt takes time, but I think I have it. I need to output based on these instructions!\n\nTo solve this challenge, I will first identify the \"framed regions\" in the input grid. Each frame is bounded by color 3 (green) and contains a solid block of a specific \"inner color\". The transformation involves identifying \"gaps\" (cells of color 8) in the border of these frames, filling them with the inner color, and projecting beams of that color outwards from the gap.\n\n**1. Analyze the Input and Identify Frames:**\n\n*   **Frame 1 (Red, Color 2):**\n    *   **Location:** Rows 4-7, Columns 3-6.\n    *   **Inner Block:** Color 2 at R5-6, C4-5.\n    *   **Gaps in Border:**\n        *   **Top Edge:** R4, C4 is 8. (Action: Beam Up).\n        *   **Left Edge:** R5, C3 is 8. (Action: Beam Left).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner:** R7, C6 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Down-Right).\n\n*   **Frame 2 (Yellow, Color 4):**\n    *   **Location:** Rows 4-7, Columns 15-18.\n    *   **Inner Block:** Color 4 at R5-6, C16-17.\n    *   **Gaps in Border:**\n        *   **Right Edge:** R5, C18 is 8. (Action: Beam Right).\n        *   **Bottom Edge:** R7, C16 is 8. (Action: Beam Down).\n        *   **Top-Right Corner:** R4, C18 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Up-Right).\n\n*   **Frame 3 (Magenta, Color 6):**\n    *   **Location:** Rows 13-16, Columns 22-25.\n    *   **Inner Block:** Color 6 at R14-15, C23-24.\n    *   **Gaps in Border:**\n        *   **Top Edge:** R13, C23 is 8. (Action: Beam Up).\n        *   **Top-Right Corner:** R13, C25 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Up-Right).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner:** R16, C25 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Down-Right).\n\n*   **Frame 4 (Orange, Color 7):**\n    *   **Location:** Rows 20-23, Columns 21-24.\n    *   **Inner Block:** Color 7 at R21-22, C22-23.\n    *   **Gaps in Border:**\n        *   **Right Edge:** R21, C24 is 8. (Action: Beam Right).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner:** R23, C24 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Down-Right).\n\n*   **Frame 5 (Maroon, Color 9):**\n    *   **Location:** Rows 25-28, Columns 0-3.\n    *   **Inner Block:** Color 9 at R26-27, C1-2.\n    *   **Gaps in Border:**\n        *   **Top Edge:** R25, C2 is 8. (Action: Beam Up).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner:** R28, C3 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Down-Right).\n\n**2. Simulate Beam Projections and Resolve Collisions:**\n\nBeams stop when they hit the grid edge or a non-8 cell. Collisions are resolved based on distance from source (first arrival wins).\n\n*   **Collision 1 (R5, C2):**\n    *   **Beam A:** Frame 1 Left Beam (Color 2). Source R5, C3. Distance to C2 is 1.\n    *   **Beam B:** Frame 5 Top Beam (Color 9). Source R25, C2. Distance to R5 is 20.\n    *   **Result:** Beam A arrives first. R5, C2 becomes 2. Beam B stops at R6, C2.\n\n*   **Collision 2 (R5, C23):**\n    *   **Beam A:** Frame 2 Right Beam (Color 4). Source R5, C18. Distance to C23 is 5.\n    *   **Beam B:** Frame 3 Top Beam (Color 6). Source R13, C23. Distance to R5 is 8.\n    *   **Result:** Beam A arrives first. R5, C23 becomes 4. Beam B stops at R6, C23.\n\n*   **Collision 3 (R17, C16):**\n    *   **Beam A:** Frame 1 Diagonal Down-Right (Color 2). Source R7, C6. Distance to (17,16) is 10 steps.\n    *   **Beam B:** Frame 2 Vertical Down (Color 4). Source R7, C16. Distance to R17 is 10 steps.\n    *   **Result:** Simultaneous arrival. Based on similar structures in example solutions, Vertical beams tend to block Diagonal ones. R17, C16 becomes 4. Beam A stops at R16, C15.\n\n**3. Construct Output Grid:**\n\n*   **Background:** 8\n*   **Frame 1 (Color 2):**\n    *   Fill R4 C4. Beam Up: R0-3 C4 -> 2.\n    *   Fill R5 C3. Beam Left: R5 C0-2 -> 2.\n    *   Fill R7 C6.

Beams **do not overwrite** non-background cells, so previously painted content blocks later beam propagation.\n\nApplying that to the test grid yields:\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"26\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_11_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find each framed region**: a \u201cframe\u201d is a connected border of color **3** forming a rectangle; inside it is a solid interior color **X** (here X \u2208 {2,4,6,7,9}).\n2. **Locate openings**: along that frame\u2019s rectangle perimeter, any cell that is **8** (instead of 3) is an opening.\n3. **Fill openings**: change each opening cell **8 \u2192 X**.\n4. **Emit a beam from each opening**:\n   - Determine the beam direction by looking at the **nearest interior X cell** to that opening; the direction is the step from that interior cell toward the opening (one of the 8 compass directions).\n   -

If two beams would occupy the same cell, that intersection cell stays **8**, both beams stop one step before it, and each continues in a **deflected direction**: rotate its direction **45\u00b0 toward** the other beam\u2019s direction (this creates the characteristic diagonal \u201cturn\u201d patterns).\n\nApplying this to the test grid yields the following output.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n```csv\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8\n2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8\n8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8\n9,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,9,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8\n      2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8\n      8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8\n      9,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,9,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,7\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- SELECT THE BEST RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1. It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
