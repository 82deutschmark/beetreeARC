I need to transform these messy input grids into cleaner, nested rectangular structures. My core idea is to first analyze the input to figure out the nesting and then build a clean, layered output.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic parameters: the input dimensions, the background color, and the foreground color. Then, I will carefully examine the examples to identify patterns. The hints are crucial! They point toward \"jagged\" shapes becoming rectangles and \"nested levels\" transforming into concentric shapes. I will look for any small, compact foreground areas and make a note to keep them relatively unchanged.\n\nHere's my approach:\n\n1.  **Parse the input**: I need to examine the grid and identify the foreground color's connected components. I'll need to develop a systematic way to represent the nesting, perhaps by assigning \"depth\" to each pixel based on its relationship to the background.\n2.  **Define and Rank the Pixels**: I'm going to determine a way of ranking the pixels. I\u2019ll make a \"Flood Fill\" approach starting from the border or from any pixels connected to the border and marking them, which defines a hierarchy of shells. This approach should help me identify the nesting levels within the shapes. I will have a rank system of the foreground pixels. Odd-ranked ones are shells and even-ranked ones are spaces, etc.\n3.  **Construct Output Rectangles**: Based on the identified shells, I'll then construct the rectangular output. Each shell gets represented by a rectangular border.\n4.  **Geometry**: Inside each frame, there will be the next shell (if there is one). This is where I have to deal with the spatial relationship between components: Where do I place each rectangle inside another one? What if there are multiple objects at the same level? How do I set the width of the gap between the frames?\n\nI\u2019m particularly focused on how \"deep\" the nesting goes (how many levels of foreground and background). The core idea is that the output size is driven by the depth and by the smallest element. The smallest unit is 1x1.\n\n5.  **Small blocks**: The \"persistence\" hint is intriguing. It sounds like small, compact foreground blocks from the input will remain mostly unchanged in the output. I need to test this theory and determine if they become 1x1, or if they scale with layers.\n\nI'll iterate and refine this approach as I go, checking each step against the examples to make sure my logic is sound.\n\nThe Test Input is a great chance to apply this plan in a systematic way. Time to begin.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I analyzed the input to understand the topological structure of the foreground shapes (color 6) against the background (color 8).\n\n1.  **Identify Global Structure**: The input contains a large outer frame of color 6. This corresponds to the outermost nesting level, which will form the border of the output grid.\n2.  **Analyze Inner Components**: Inside this outer frame (in the \"gap\" of color 8), there are distinct connected components of color 6.\n    *   **Left Component**: Located around columns 2-4 and rows 9-11. This is a compact, solid-looking block of 6s. According to the problem logic (and \"persistence\" hint), solid blocks at the deepest level are represented as 1x1 dots.\n    *   **Middle Component**: Located around columns 8-15 and rows 7-14. This is a large, complex shape.\n        *   It has an outer boundary (roughly columns 8 and 14/15).\n        *   Inside this boundary, there is a region of background 8s (a \"hole\").\n        *   Inside the hole, there is another structure of 6s (centered around columns 10-12).\n        *   This inner structure itself appears to contain 8s (e.g., row 11, col 10), implying it is a ring or a frame enclosing a core. However, careful inspection of the \"core\" suggests it resolves to a single point or solid block at the center.\n        *   Topologically, this structure is a \"Frame\" containing a \"Frame\" containing a \"Center\". This nesting depth (Outer Border -> Gap -> Inner Border -> Gap -> Core) corresponds to a 5x5 nested box pattern in the output (Border, Gap, Center Dot).\n    *   **Connectivity**: The \"Right Object\" (column 15) appears fused to the Middle Component in row 8 (`6,6` at cols 14-15), so it is treated as part of the Middle Component rather than a separate object. The Left Component is separated by a gap of 8s.\n\n3.  **Determine Output Layout**:\n    *   The output will capture the \"clean\" rectangular topology of these components.\n    *   **Left Object**: A 1x1 dot.\n    *   **Middle Object**: A 5x5 nested box (Outer Ring + Center Dot).\n    *   **Arrangement**: The Left Object is to the left of the Middle Object.\n    *   **Spacing**:\n        *   Left Object width: 1.\n        *   Gap between objects: 1.\n        *   Middle Object width: 5.\n        *   Total Content Width: $1 + 1 + 5 = 7$.\n    *   **Margins**: The main frame adds a 1-pixel border and a 1-pixel gap on all sides.\n        *   Total Output Width = $7 + 2(\\text{gap}) + 2(\\text{border}) = 11$.\n        *   Total Output Height = $5(\\text{Middle Height}) + 4 = 9$.\n\n4.  **Construct Output Grid**:\n    *   Grid size: 11x9.\n    *   Fill with background (8).\n    *   Draw Main Frame (6) on the border.\n    *   Place content in the center area (rows 2-6, cols 2-8).\n    *   **Left Dot**: At Row 4, Column 2.\n    *   **Middle Box**: Spans Rows 2-6 and Columns 4-8.\n        *   Draw Border (6) for the 5x5 box.\n        *   Draw Center Dot (6) at the middle of the box (Row 4, Column 6).\n\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,6\n6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,6\n6,8,6,8,6,8,6,8,6,8,6\n6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,6\n6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,6\n6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\nOkay, here's my thought process as I tackle this ARC task. The user wants me to solve this based on given examples, so I'm diving in!\n\n**Analyzing and Decomposing the Problem**\n\nFirst, I'm trying to figure out what's going on. The examples are key. I notice a pattern: there's an input grid, and the output is like a cleaned-up, simplified version. The hint mentions \"jagged outlines are replaced by clean... rectangular frames,\" and \"multiple levels become nested rectangles.\" It seems I need to count the *levels* of things in the input.\n\nExample 1: I see a messy shape in the input, filled with color `4`, against a background of `3`.  The output is a set of nested rectangles of the foreground color, `4`. I look closely at the output, the first thing is 9 x 11. It seems that inner rectangles are created, by a gap of 1 unit. There's an outer frame and two nested frames, each smaller. This is like nested Russian dolls! What determines their sizes and nesting? And more importantly, what determines the ratio?\n\nExample 2: A different color, but the same idea. There's a shape of `4` and the output is a smaller rectangle with an internal hole. Maybe the number of distinct components = number of rectangles to construct? I see two levels of nesting: an outer boundary and an inner blob. The output has an outer square and a central `4` pixel. Maybe the structure is encoded in the pixel structure? And not the shape?\n\nI start to formulate a hypothesis. It's about finding the *depth* of the foreground components. Basically, I have to figure out how many \"loops\" surround a given point. Each level becomes a rectangle in the output, maybe with a 1-unit gap.\n\nI see that the output \"encodes\" the nesting, not the precise geometry. I think \"persist with little/no modification\" - This is for single-pixel \"leaves\". I see a connection to the bounding box: Maybe I should look at the outermost boundaries of the components in the input and output? I am curious if the ratios are the same. Or the transformation function is just \"reduce everything\".\n\nIn Example 3, background is `4` and the foreground are `9`s. The input is something that looks like 2 blobs. The output is a big rectangle with two little dots. Then it's not a simplification of the structure. I have to count the separated \"objects\" inside the container. So the algorithm should be: Extract background and foreground, locate any nesting. For a leaf, it will be a 1x1 dot, or a small dot or short line. For a loop it should become a \"frame\" in the output. Maybe the frame size is determined by the max-min coordinates of the input, plus a buffer of 1 unit?\n\n**Building the Strategy**\n\nThe core idea is:\n1.  **Extract the components:** Identify the background color and the foreground shapes.\n2.  **Determine the Nesting:** It involves traversing the adjacency graph and determining the inclusion relationships to construct the levels.\n3.  **Construct Output:** Create rectangles corresponding to each level, and adjust the bounding box depending on the nesting. If a block is small/dot like, keep it a dot (1x1).\n\n**Tackling the Test Input**\n\nFor the test input, background is `8` and foreground is `6`. I see a large structure that appears to contain an inner shape, which in turn seems to have another inner shape. This looks similar to the prior examples.\n\n*   I start scanning for the `6`s to map the nesting levels. I will create a topology map.\n*   Level 1: Outer `6`s form the outer boundary.\n*   Level 2:  Inside, there is a region of `8` and `6` objects.\n*   Level 3: There are nested `6`s inside.\n\nI identify two distinct parts:\n1.  A compact block of `6` (Object A).\n2.  A loop of `6` (Object B) containing a smaller block of `6` (Object C)\n\nThen I work on bounding box for `6`:\n- Leaf Node (small block in input) = `6`\n- Large node (box)= frame\n\nNow, about sizes. The leaf nodes should be simplified based on \"persist\". I guess if the block is small in input (3 pixels or less), reduce it to one pixel. I decide to reduce them to 1x1 pixels to get a concise representation.\n\nBased on the structure and 1x1 leaves, the content inside this 11x9 grid:\n\n-   Draw a frame or a loop\n\nThe task requires transforming a complex, messy input grid into a clean, schematic output grid. Based on the solved examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n1.  **Identify Hierarchy:** The input image is parsed into a hierarchy of nested shapes formed by the foreground color (in the test case, `6`) and the background color (`8`).\n    *   **Level 1 (Root):** The outermost boundary or \"hull\" of the foreground color.\n    *   **Level 2:** The objects found directly inside the main loop of the Level 1 shape.\n    *   **Level 3:** The objects found inside any Level 2 loops, and so on.\n2.  **Simplify Shapes:**\n    *   **Containers/Loops:** Any structure that encloses a distinct inner region (a loop) is transformed into a clean, axis-aligned rectangular frame.\n    *   **Solid Blocks/Leaves:** Small, solid, compact blocks of foreground color (which do not contain holes) are simplified to single 1x1 pixels (dots).\n3.  **Construct Layout:**\n    *   The output grid is constructed by nesting these rectangular frames and dots, preserving their topological hierarchy (parent-child relationships) and relative spatial order (left/right, top/bottom).\n    *   Spacing is standardized: A 1-pixel gap of background color separates a frame from its contents or adjacent objects. Frames are 1 pixel thick.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Background:** `8`. **Foreground:** `6`.\n*   **Topology Analysis:**\n    *   **Outer Hull:** There is a large outer boundary of `6`s surrounding the entire relevant area. This becomes the **Outer Frame**.\n    *   **Inner Contents:** Inside this outer hull, there are two distinct structures located in a \"sea\" of background `8`:\n        1.  **Left Object:** Located roughly at columns 2-4 and rows 9-11. It is a solid 3x3 block of `6`s. This is a \"Leaf\" node and becomes a **Dot (1x1)**.\n        2.  **Right Object:** Located roughly at columns 8-15 and rows 7-14. It consists of a boundary of `6`s enclosing an inner region. This is a \"Loop\" node and becomes an **Inner Frame**.\n    *   **Inside Right Object:** Inside the Right Object's loop, there is another solid 3x3 block of `6`s (roughly columns 10-12). This is a \"Leaf\" node inside the Inner Frame and becomes a **Dot (1x1)**.\n*   **Layout & Dimensions:**\n    *   **Right Item (Frame + Dot):** The inner dot is 1x1. The frame surrounding it requires a 1-pixel gap and a 1-pixel wall.\n        *   Size = (1 pixel dot) + (2 * 1 pixel gap) + (2 * 1 pixel wall) = **5x5**.\n    *   **Left Item (Dot):** Size = **1x1**.\n    *   **Arrangement:** The Left Item and Right Item are side-by-side (Left then Right).\n        *   Width = 1 (Left) + 1 (Gap) + 5 (Right) = **7**.\n        *   Height = Max(1, 5) = **5**.\n    *   **Outer Frame:** Encloses the 7x5 content area with a 1-pixel gap and 1-pixel wall.\n        *   Width = 7 + 2(gap) + 2(wall) = **11**.\n        *   Height = 5 + 2(gap) + 2(wall) = **9**.\n\n**Output Grid Construction (11x9):**\n*   **Outer Frame:** A box of `6`s covering the grid border.\n*   **Interior:** Filled with `8`.\n*   **Content:** Placed in the 7x5 inner area (Rows 2-6, Cols 2-8).\n    *   **Left Dot:** At (Row 4, Col 2). (Centered vertically).\n    *   **Right Box:** Spans Rows 2-6, Cols 4-8.\n        *   Frame of `6`s.\n        *   Center Dot of `6` at (Row 4, Col 6).\n\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,6\n6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,6\n6,8,6,8,6,8,6,8,6,8,6\n6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,6\n6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,6\n6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n</CANDIDATE 9>\n</INPUT_DATA>\n\n<AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\nExecute this pipeline sequentially for every Candidate.

I need to transform these messy input grids into cleaner, nested rectangular structures. My core idea is to first analyze the input to figure out the nesting and then build a clean, layered output.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic parameters: the input dimensions, the background color, and the foreground color. Then, I will carefully examine the examples to identify patterns. The hints are crucial! They point toward \"jagged\" shapes becoming rectangles and \"nested levels\" transforming into concentric shapes. I will look for any small, compact foreground areas and make a note to keep them relatively unchanged.\n\nHere's my approach:\n\n1.  **Parse the input**: I need to examine the grid and identify the foreground color's connected components. I'll need to develop a systematic way to represent the nesting, perhaps by assigning \"depth\" to each pixel based on its relationship to the background.\n2.  **Define and Rank the Pixels**: I'm going to determine a way of ranking the pixels. I\u2019ll make a \"Flood Fill\" approach starting from the border or from any pixels connected to the border and marking them, which defines a hierarchy of shells. This approach should help me identify the nesting levels within the shapes. I will have a rank system of the foreground pixels. Odd-ranked ones are shells and even-ranked ones are spaces, etc.\n3.  **Construct Output Rectangles**: Based on the identified shells, I'll then construct the rectangular output. Each shell gets represented by a rectangular border.\n4.  **Geometry**: Inside each frame, there will be the next shell (if there is one). This is where I have to deal with the spatial relationship between components: Where do I place each rectangle inside another one? What if there are multiple objects at the same level? How do I set the width of the gap between the frames?\n\nI\u2019m particularly focused on how \"deep\" the nesting goes (how many levels of foreground and background). The core idea is that the output size is driven by the depth and by the smallest element. The smallest unit is 1x1.\n\n5.  **Small blocks**: The \"persistence\" hint is intriguing. It sounds like small, compact foreground blocks from the input will remain mostly unchanged in the output. I need to test this theory and determine if they become 1x1, or if they scale with layers.\n\nI'll iterate and refine this approach as I go, checking each step against the examples to make sure my logic is sound.\n\nThe Test Input is a great chance to apply this plan in a systematic way. Time to begin.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I analyzed the input to understand the topological structure of the foreground shapes (color 6) against the background (color 8).\n\n1.  **Identify Global Structure**: The input contains a large outer frame of color 6. This corresponds to the outermost nesting level, which will form the border of the output grid.\n2.  **Analyze Inner Components**: Inside this outer frame (in the \"gap\" of color 8), there are distinct connected components of color 6.\n    *   **Left Component**: Located around columns 2-4 and rows 9-11. This is a compact, solid-looking block of 6s. According to the problem logic (and \"persistence\" hint), solid blocks at the deepest level are represented as 1x1 dots.\n    *   **Middle Component**: Located around columns 8-15 and rows 7-14. This is a large, complex shape.\n        *   It has an outer boundary (roughly columns 8 and 14/15).\n        *   Inside this boundary, there is a region of background 8s (a \"hole\").\n        *   Inside the hole, there is another structure of 6s (centered around columns 10-12).\n        *   This inner structure itself appears to contain 8s (e.g., row 11, col 10), implying it is a ring or a frame enclosing a core. However, careful inspection of the \"core\" suggests it resolves to a single point or solid block at the center.\n        *   Topologically, this structure is a \"Frame\" containing a \"Frame\" containing a \"Center\". This nesting depth (Outer Border -> Gap -> Inner Border -> Gap -> Core) corresponds to a 5x5 nested box pattern in the output (Border, Gap, Center Dot).\n    *   **Connectivity**: The \"Right Object\" (column 15) appears fused to the Middle Component in row 8 (`6,6` at cols 14-15), so it is treated as part of the Middle Component rather than a separate object. The Left Component is separated by a gap of 8s.\n\n3.  **Determine Output Layout**:\n    *   The output will capture the \"clean\" rectangular topology of these components.\n    *   **Left Object**: A 1x1 dot.\n    *   **Middle Object**: A 5x5 nested box (Outer Ring + Center Dot).\n    *   **Arrangement**: The Left Object is to the left of the Middle Object.\n    *   **Spacing**:\n        *   Left Object width: 1.\n        *   Gap between objects: 1.\n        *   Middle Object width: 5.\n        *   Total Content Width: $1 + 1 + 5 = 7$.\n    *   **Margins**: The main frame adds a 1-pixel border and a 1-pixel gap on all sides.\n        *   Total Output Width = $7 + 2(\\text{gap}) + 2(\\text{border}) = 11$.\n        *   Total Output Height = $5(\\text{Middle Height}) + 4 = 9$.\n\n4.  **Construct Output Grid**:\n    *   Grid size: 11x9.\n    *   Fill with background (8).\n    *   Draw Main Frame (6) on the border.\n    *   Place content in the center area (rows 2-6, cols 2-8).\n    *   **Left Dot**: At Row 4, Column 2.\n    *   **Middle Box**: Spans Rows 2-6 and Columns 4-8.\n        *   Draw Border (6) for the 5x5 box.\n        *   Draw Center Dot (6) at the middle of the box (Row 4, Column 6).\n\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,6\n6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,6\n6,8,6,8,6,8,6,8,6,8,6\n6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,6\n6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,6\n6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,6\n      6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,6\n      6,8,6,8,6,8,6,8,6,8,6\n      6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,6\n      6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,6\n      6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nOkay, here's my thought process as I tackle this ARC task. The user wants me to solve this based on given examples, so I'm diving in!\n\n**Analyzing and Decomposing the Problem**\n\nFirst, I'm trying to figure out what's going on. The examples are key. I notice a pattern: there's an input grid, and the output is like a cleaned-up, simplified version. The hint mentions \"jagged outlines are replaced by clean... rectangular frames,\" and \"multiple levels become nested rectangles.\" It seems I need to count the *levels* of things in the input.\n\nExample 1: I see a messy shape in the input, filled with color `4`, against a background of `3`.  The output is a set of nested rectangles of the foreground color, `4`. I look closely at the output, the first thing is 9 x 11. It seems that inner rectangles are created, by a gap of 1 unit. There's an outer frame and two nested frames, each smaller. This is like nested Russian dolls! What determines their sizes and nesting? And more importantly, what determines the ratio?\n\nExample 2: A different color, but the same idea. There's a shape of `4` and the output is a smaller rectangle with an internal hole. Maybe the number of distinct components = number of rectangles to construct? I see two levels of nesting: an outer boundary and an inner blob. The output has an outer square and a central `4` pixel. Maybe the structure is encoded in the pixel structure? And not the shape?\n\nI start to formulate a hypothesis. It's about finding the *depth* of the foreground components. Basically, I have to figure out how many \"loops\" surround a given point. Each level becomes a rectangle in the output, maybe with a 1-unit gap.\n\nI see that the output \"encodes\" the nesting, not the precise geometry. I think \"persist with little/no modification\" - This is for single-pixel \"leaves\". I see a connection to the bounding box: Maybe I should look at the outermost boundaries of the components in the input and output? I am curious if the ratios are the same. Or the transformation function is just \"reduce everything\".\n\nIn Example 3, background is `4` and the foreground are `9`s. The input is something that looks like 2 blobs. The output is a big rectangle with two little dots. Then it's not a simplification of the structure. I have to count the separated \"objects\" inside the container. So the algorithm should be: Extract background and foreground, locate any nesting. For a leaf, it will be a 1x1 dot, or a small dot or short line. For a loop it should become a \"frame\" in the output. Maybe the frame size is determined by the max-min coordinates of the input, plus a buffer of 1 unit?\n\n**Building the Strategy**\n\nThe core idea is:\n1.  **Extract the components:** Identify the background color and the foreground shapes.\n2.  **Determine the Nesting:** It involves traversing the adjacency graph and determining the inclusion relationships to construct the levels.\n3.  **Construct Output:** Create rectangles corresponding to each level, and adjust the bounding box depending on the nesting. If a block is small/dot like, keep it a dot (1x1).\n\n**Tackling the Test Input**\n\nFor the test input, background is `8` and foreground is `6`. I see a large structure that appears to contain an inner shape, which in turn seems to have another inner shape. This looks similar to the prior examples.\n\n*   I start scanning for the `6`s to map the nesting levels. I will create a topology map.\n*   Level 1: Outer `6`s form the outer boundary.\n*   Level 2:  Inside, there is a region of `8` and `6` objects.\n*   Level 3: There are nested `6`s inside.\n\nI identify two distinct parts:\n1.  A compact block of `6` (Object A).\n2.  A loop of `6` (Object B) containing a smaller block of `6` (Object C)\n\nThen I work on bounding box for `6`:\n- Leaf Node (small block in input) = `6`\n- Large node (box)= frame\n\nNow, about sizes. The leaf nodes should be simplified based on \"persist\". I guess if the block is small in input (3 pixels or less), reduce it to one pixel. I decide to reduce them to 1x1 pixels to get a concise representation.\n\nBased on the structure and 1x1 leaves, the content inside this 11x9 grid:\n\n-   Draw a frame or a loop\n\nThe task requires transforming a complex, messy input grid into a clean, schematic output grid. Based on the solved examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n1.  **Identify Hierarchy:** The input image is parsed into a hierarchy of nested shapes formed by the foreground color (in the test case, `6`) and the background color (`8`).\n    *   **Level 1 (Root):** The outermost boundary or \"hull\" of the foreground color.\n    *   **Level 2:** The objects found directly inside the main loop of the Level 1 shape.\n    *   **Level 3:** The objects found inside any Level 2 loops, and so on.\n2.  **Simplify Shapes:**\n    *   **Containers/Loops:** Any structure that encloses a distinct inner region (a loop) is transformed into a clean, axis-aligned rectangular frame.\n    *   **Solid Blocks/Leaves:** Small, solid, compact blocks of foreground color (which do not contain holes) are simplified to single 1x1 pixels (dots).\n3.  **Construct Layout:**\n    *   The output grid is constructed by nesting these rectangular frames and dots, preserving their topological hierarchy (parent-child relationships) and relative spatial order (left/right, top/bottom).\n    *   Spacing is standardized: A 1-pixel gap of background color separates a frame from its contents or adjacent objects. Frames are 1 pixel thick.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Background:** `8`. **Foreground:** `6`.\n*   **Topology Analysis:**\n    *   **Outer Hull:** There is a large outer boundary of `6`s surrounding the entire relevant area. This becomes the **Outer Frame**.\n    *   **Inner Contents:** Inside this outer hull, there are two distinct structures located in a \"sea\" of background `8`:\n        1.  **Left Object:** Located roughly at columns 2-4 and rows 9-11. It is a solid 3x3 block of `6`s. This is a \"Leaf\" node and becomes a **Dot (1x1)**.\n        2.  **Right Object:** Located roughly at columns 8-15 and rows 7-14. It consists of a boundary of `6`s enclosing an inner region. This is a \"Loop\" node and becomes an **Inner Frame**.\n    *   **Inside Right Object:** Inside the Right Object's loop, there is another solid 3x3 block of `6`s (roughly columns 10-12).

It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
