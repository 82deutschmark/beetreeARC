            "Full raw LLM response": "**Solution Synthesis for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this ARC task. The goal is to figure out the pattern transformation from input to output, and I've got a pretty solid handle on it now.  The core idea is that the output grid is a modified version of a standard pattern, and the input object's color and shape control this modification.\n\nThe output is always a 16x16 grid, which I'm viewing as a 5x5 grid of 3x3 \"tiles\" separated by single-pixel black lines.  The key is the background pattern within these tiles. This background pattern can be one of four distinct types.\n\nBased on the three provided examples, I've deduced that the *color* of the shape in the input is the key.  Each color corresponds to a specific background pattern:\n\n*   **Green (3):** The base grid is black, and each cell gets filled with orange (7). Imagine it's highlighting a \"filled\" version of each cell.\n*   **Blue (1):**  The base grid is black, and only the *vertical* separating lines are orange.\n*   **Magenta (6):** The base grid is black, but the *horizontal and vertical* separating lines are orange, creating a standard grid structure.\n*   **Red (2) [Hypothesis]:** Based on the preceding and what I've seen with the Test input, Red (2) will generate a pattern consisting of only *the intersection points* in the grid colored orange.\n\nThe trick is, for each of these base patterns, a region of the grid is then \"highlighted\" by changing the \"inactive\" parts of the pattern to maroon (9) and keeping the \"active\" parts. The highlighted region always corresponds to the center \"cell\" in the 5x5 grid, plus the adjacent lines.\n\nThe *shape* of the object gives you a visual cue on what gets \"highlighted.\"  For example, with the green \"plus\" shape (cell), a rectangle shape in the output's central area also results. In the Test input, the object consists of four isolated points that form the corners of a square (color 2), and my hypothesis is that this isolates four points also as the pattern in the \"highlight\".\n\nLet me quickly summarize my code construction steps to generate the proper 16x16 output:\n\n1.  **Construct Base Grid:** Build a 16x16 grid. In the Test Input case, because we assume Red (2) implies \"Intersections\", fill all intersection points (where grid lines cross) to 7 (orange) and other pixels to 0 (black).\n2.  **Locate Highlight Region:** Identify the \"target\" central 6x6 pixel section within the grid, where this area will be modified, it goes from rows and cols 5 to 10.\n3.  **Modify Target Region:**  Iterate through the target region's pixels. Those whose original color should be \"inactive\" (black) will now become maroon (9). Those that are meant to stay \"active\" (7) stay as 7.\n\nAnd I've double checked all of the examples against this logic so that I can provide with confidence the Test's output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid.\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Output Structure**: The 16x16 output grid represents a 5x5 array of 2x2 \"cells\" separated by 1-pixel wide grid lines.\n    *   **Intersection Points**: Indices $(3r, 3c)$ for $r,c \\in 0..5$.\n    *   **Horizontal Segments**: Indices $(3r, 3c+1..3c+2)$.\n    *   **Vertical Segments**: Indices $(3r+1..3r+2, 3c)$.\n    *   **Cell Interiors**: Indices $(3r+1..3r+2, 3c+1..3c+2)$.\n\n2.  **Background Pattern Generation**: The specific colored shape in the input determines the background pattern of the output grid. The pattern consists of assigning the input's background color (7) to specific structural components (Active) and leaving others as Black (0) (Inactive).\n    *   **Example 1 (Green '3' Shape - Plus)**: Maps to **Filled Cells**. The Cell Interiors are 7; Grid Lines/Intersections are 0.\n    *   **Example 2 (Blue '1' Shape - Vertical lines)**: Maps to **Vertical Grid**. The Vertical Segments are 7; H-Segments, Intersections, and Cells are 0.\n    *   **Example 3 (Magenta '6' Shape - Cross/Network)**: Maps to **Connected Grid**. Both Vertical and Horizontal Segments are 7; Intersections and Cells are 0.\n    *   **Test Input (Red '2' Shape - Four Corners)**: The shape consists of four points arranged in a square. Geometrically, this corresponds to the **Intersections** of the grid. Thus, the pattern is: **Intersection Points are 7**; Segments and Cells are 0.\n\n3.  **Focus Region Highlight**: A specific 6x6 region in the output grid, corresponding to the central tile and its boundaries (Indices: **Rows 5-10, Cols 5-10**), is highlighted.\n    *   In this region, **Active** pixels (those that are 7 in the background pattern) remain **7**.\n    *   **Inactive** pixels (those that are 0 in the background pattern) are changed to Maroon (**9**).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Background Pattern**: Intersections (Indices where row % 3 == 0 and col % 3 == 0) are 7. All other pixels are 0.\n*   **Modification in Region [5..10, 5..10]**:\n    *   The Intersection points in this region are at **(6,6), (6,9), (9,6), (9,9)**. These remain **7**.\n    *   All other pixels in this 6x6 area (Segments and Cells) are Inactive (0), so they become **9**.\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid:**\n*   **Standard Rows (0-4, 11-15)**: Follow the Intersection pattern (7 at cols 0,3,6,9,12,15 for rows 0,3,12,15; all 0 for others).\n*   **Modified Rows (5-10)**:\n    *   **Rows 5, 7, 8, 10** (Cell/Segment rows): Originally all 0. Inside the region (cols 5-10), they become 9. Result: `...0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0...`\n    *   **Rows 6, 9** (Intersection rows): Originally 7 at intersections, 0 elsewhere. Inside the region (cols 5-10):\n        *   Cols 5, 7, 8, 10 (Segments) -> 0 becomes 9.\n        *   Cols 6, 9 (Intersections) -> 7 remains 7.\n        *   Result: `...0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0...` (combined with the outer pattern).\n\noutput:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**I've got this!** I'm tasked with solving an ARC problem using a pattern-based approach, given solved examples and a test input. Here's my thought process:\n\n**First, I need to analyze the input grids.**  They're all 6x6, featuring a background color and a smaller 3x3 pattern in a distinct color.  The challenge seems to be about translating this pattern into a larger, patterned output. Let's look at the patterns in the inputs.\n\nI noticed three key elements: a background color (orange/7), a pattern color (varies by example), and a recurring, distinct 3x3 pattern. Example 1 is a cross shape of green pixels (3). Example 2 is a \"H\" or box shape with blue pixels (1). Example 3 is an \"X\" shape with magenta pixels (6).  The test input uses a pattern of red pixels (2).\n\n**Second, I'll examine the output grids.** They're 16x16, larger and more complex.  There's a repeating 2x2 grid structure, separated by 1-pixel borders. The content within these 2x2 blocks seems related to the input pattern, but not a direct copy. The most striking thing is that the grid structure itself appears constant across the examples. Additionally, there's a unique \"maroon box\" (color 9) at the center.\n\n**My hypothesis: The output is a zoomed-in representation of a 5x5 subgrid of the input, but the input values are mapped to new pixel values based on the shapes involved.**  \n* I noticed that the input size of 6x6 does not evenly divide into a tile-able pattern for the output of 16x16.\n* All output grids are 16x16 and have a 5x5 grid structure, which is separated by a 1-pixel border.\n\nThe critical observation is that the output *doesn't* contain the *color* of the input pattern (3, 1, 6). Instead, it uses 0, 7, and 9.  My insight is that 0 and 7 seem to be used to display a shape.\n\n**I have determined that the transformation is about the *structure/shape* of the pattern, rendered in the 0/7/9 color palette.** So let's look at the output examples again. I can infer the values in the 2x2 \"cell\" of the output by looking at the input, but the value is always mapped to 0 or 7. I found that the Maroon Box is a square ring and always located at the 5-10 index.\n\nI can make a basic model:\n*   Use Input(0,0), Input(0,1), Input(1,0) to determine 3 output values\n*   Cell, V, and H colors\n*   Cell Color = value based on Input(0,0). (Pattern = 0)\n*   V-Seg Color = value based on Input(0,1). (Background = 7, Pattern = 0)\n*   H-Seg Color = If Input(0,0) = 0 and Input(1,0) = 0 , 0, otherwise 7\n    *   H-Seg color = If both corners are pat and Row 0 sides are Pat then 0 else 7\n\nThen, construct the Output:\n- Horizontal Border = Output[0], Output[3] etc, always follows H-Seg rule\n- Vertical Border = Output[1], Output[4] etc, always follows V-Seg rule\n- Cell in the middle always uses the cell rule\n- All remaining pixels outside the Maroon Ring are generated using the above rules\n- Pixels inside the Maroon Ring always use value 9 (maroon) except for V and H Borders\n\nTherefore, I have a method to transform any 6x6 image to a 16x16 image!\n\n\nThe transformation maps a 3x3 pattern found in the input 6x6 grid to a 16x16 output grid. The output grid is composed of 5x5 cells (2x2 pixels each) separated by 1-pixel borders. The colors in the output are restricted to 0 (black), 7 (orange), and 9 (maroon), regardless of the pattern color in the input.\n\nThe 16x16 output is generated in two steps:\n1.  **Generate a Base Grid:** The base grid's texture depends on the specific pixels of the 3x3 input pattern. Let the 3x3 pattern be $P$, where pixels are either 'Pattern Color' (Pat) or 'Background Color' (Bg/7).\n    *   **Cell Color (2x2 blocks):** Determined by $P(0,0)$ (Top-Left pixel). If $P(0,0)$ is Pat, Cell Color is 0. If Bg, Cell Color is 7.\n    *   **Vertical Border Color (columns 0, 3, 6...):** Determined by $P(0,1)$ (Top-Middle pixel). If $P(0,1)$ is Pat, Border is 0. If Bg, Border is 7.\n    *   **Horizontal Border Segments (rows 0, 3, 6...):** Determined by $P(0,0)$ and $P(1,0)$. If ($P(0,0)$ is Pat AND $P(1,0)$ is Pat), Segment is 0. Else, Segment is 7. Note: Intersections of borders (pixels at border row/col crossings) are always 0.\n\n2.  **Apply Maroon Overlay:** A 6x6 square region of color 9 (maroon) is overlaid on the center of the grid (indices 5-10 for both row and column). The overlay follows a priority rule:\n    *   Existing 7s are preserved (7 > 9).\n    *   Existing 0s are overwritten by 9 (9 > 0).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Input Pattern:** The 3x3 pattern is formed by Red (2) pixels on Orange (7).\n    *   Row 0: `2 7 2`\n    *   Row 1: `7 7 7`\n    *   Row 2: `2 7 2`\n*   **Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   $P(0,0)$ is 2 (Pat). -> **Cell Color = 0**.\n    *   $P(0,1)$ is 7 (Bg). -> **Vertical Border = 7**.\n    *   $P(1,0)$ is 7 (Bg). The condition (Pat AND Pat) is false. -> **Horizontal Border Segment = 7**.\n*   **Base Grid Construction:**\n    *   Horizontal Border Rows (0, 3, 6...): `0` (intersect) `7 7` (segment) `0` ... -> Pattern `0 7 7`.\n    *   Cell Rows (1, 2, 4, 5...): `7` (vert border) `0 0` (cell) `7` ... -> Pattern `7 0 0`.\n*   **Overlay:**\n    *   Apply to central square (rows 5-10, cols 5-10).\n    *   In this region, 7s remain 7, 0s become 9.\n\n**Resulting Grid:**\n*   Rows 0, 3, 12, 15: `0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n*   Rows 1, 2, 4, 11, 13, 14: `7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n*   Rows 5, 7, 8, 10 (Cell Rows in Overlay): `7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7`\n*   Rows 6, 9 (Border Rows in Overlay): `0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break down this ARC task!** I'm given three solved examples and a new test case, all involving 6x6 input grids that get transformed into 16x16 output grids. The core challenge is figuring out the mapping and the visual rules.\n\nFirst, I examined the inputs. They all have a background color (orange, coded as 7) and a shape (green, blue, magenta, red) overlaid. The outputs are always 16x16, with colors 0 (black), 7 (orange), and 9 (maroon/red). My initial thought was a simple zoom, but 16 isn't divisible by 6, which throws that out the window.  Then, I focused on the repeated structure of 0, 7, 7, 0, which suggests a grid-like organization in the output. The outputs seem to divide into a 5x5 grid of blocks separated by black lines, with each block 2x2.\n\nThis suggests a connection between the 6x6 input and the 5x5 blocks in the output. I realized it's not a direct cell-to-block mapping, but maybe a mapping of coordinates. I looked at the color values and thought they represent \"intersections\". In Example 1, I noticed that the red color (9) appears around a green cross. This lead me to believe that a center of the object creates the output highlight. I noticed in Examples 2 and 3 that the highlight had a different \"style\", but with the core concept of highlighting the \"area\" around the shape.\n\nThe next step was to find the shapes' center, because the visual transformation seems to be centered around the non-background cells. With the coordinates of a \"center\", I began mapping it to coordinates of the output. The highlight also helped me identify important things about the shapes.  In the final model, there are black lines and orange grid blocks that indicate the input shape.\n\nThe highlight rule became clear. The 3x3 block is Red. If a point is on an orange vertical line (col 6 or 9) AND not on a horizontal line, then the Red becomes Orange.\n\nThe test input showed four red dots in the corners of a square (0,2, 0,4, 2,2, 2,4). The model is:\n\n1. Create a 16x16 grid.\n2. Base Grid is black lines and Orange blocks\n3. The 3x3 Zone of interest is from rows 5 to 10. Columns 5 to 10.\n4. Overwrite elements in the area:\n   - Horizontal lines: 9\n   - Blocks: 9\n   - The Vertical lines in blocks stay Orange.\n   - Every other pixel is Orange.\n\nThis produces an output identical to Example 2.\n\n\nThe task involves transforming a 6x6 input grid containing a pattern into a 16x16 output grid that visualizes the pattern in a specific stylized format.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Object Detection:**\n    *   The input contains a background color (7, Orange) and a shape made of a different color.\n    *   We determine the \"bounding box\" or \"center\" of the shape.\n    *   Example 1 (Cross): Center is at (4,4). The shape spans a 3x3 area.\n    *   Example 2 (H-shape): Center is at (2,2). The shape spans a 3x3 area.\n    *   Example 3 (X-shape): Center is at (2,2). The shape spans a 3x3 area.\n    *   **Test Input:** The shape consists of Red (2) dots at (0,2), (0,4), (2,2), (2,4). The center of these coordinates is row 1, column 3. The shape defines the corners of a 3x3 area centered at (1,3).\n\n2.  **Output Grid Structure:**\n    *   The output is a 16x16 grid representing a 5x5 layout of blocks.\n    *   There are two main styles observed:\n        *   *Style A (Example 1):* Orange blocks separated by Black lines. Used for the \"Cross\" shape.\n        *   *Style B (Examples 2 & 3):* Black blocks separated by Orange vertical lines and Black horizontal lines. Used for \"Box-like\" or 3x3 distributed shapes.\n    *   The Test Input shape (corners of a square) is a 3x3 distributed pattern, similar to the \"H\" and \"X\" in Examples 2 and 3. Therefore, we use **Style B**.\n    *   **Base Pattern for Style B:**\n        *   Horizontal lines (Rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15) are Black (0).\n        *   Vertical lines (Cols 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15) are Orange (7), except where they intersect horizontal lines (become 0).\n        *   Blocks (2x2 areas between lines) are Black (0).\n\n3.  **Highlighting (The Red Zone):**\n    *   A \"Highlight Zone\" is applied to the output grid corresponding to the 3x3 area of the shape.\n    *   The zone covers the central 3x3 blocks of the 5x5 output grid structure.\n    *   In the output grid coordinates (0-15), the 3x3 block area spans from the middle of Block Row 1 to the middle of Block Row 3.\n    *   **Coordinates:** Rows 5 to 10 and Columns 5 to 10.\n    *   **Highlight Logic:**\n        *   Pixels in this zone are set to Maroon/Red (9).\n        *   *Exception:* Pixels that are part of the vertical grid lines (Cols 6 and 9) are preserved as Orange (7) *unless* they are part of a horizontal grid line (Rows 6 and 9). The horizontal grid lines in the zone become Red (9).\n        *   This creates a pattern of Red blocks and Red horizontal separators, with Orange vertical separators running through them.\n\n4.  **Applying to Test Input:**\n    *   Base Grid: Same as Example 2 (Black blocks, Orange vertical lines).\n    *   Highlight Zone: Same as Example 2 (Central 3x3 area).\n    *   The resulting grid is identical to the output of Example 2.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**I've got this!**  Let me break down the process I've been through to tackle this task.  My initial thought was, \"Okay, ARC problem - let's find the rule!\"  I immediately noticed the size difference: small input (6x6) expanding to a larger output (16x16).  The colors were a clue, too, especially the dominant orange and how maroon (or dark red) showed up differently in the outputs compared to the inputs.  I started by looking for scaling or tiling patterns, trying to connect input pixels to output blocks, but that didn't quite click.\n\nThen I squinted at the output structure. It had repeating black lines, which made me realize I was looking at a grid of data \"cells\" separated by lines.  I tried to figure out the cell size and spacing. After analyzing some examples, I guessed that each \"cell\" might represent some information from the original 6x6 input, but in the output's 5x5 grid.\n\nThat got me thinking about the input pattern and how it related to the output grid's structure. Then it all clicked: a solid \"background\" and a special overlay pattern. The grid style changes depending on the original shape.\n\nI spent a lot of time mapping the locations of the new maroon color (color 9). The main goal of my plan was to identify a rule. Now, I thought it might be the tile and grout in the output. The maroon areas, or the \"hashes,\" were like a visual \"highlight\" of the original input shape, but the pattern was shifted and \"bleeding\".\n\nI worked on figuring out the components.\n*   **Tile style.** Did my logic apply to all example types?\n\n*   **Maroon overlay pattern.** Was this related to connectivity? Did the maroon highlight the input pixels?\n\nI considered the input as a \"pattern\" (3x3), which was then used to make the maroon shape in the center of the grid.\nNext, I determined if the background shape depends on the 3x3 input.\nEx.\n*   If the corners (0,0) of the input are all the same - the grid is the same.\n*   The edges make a different style.\n\nHowever, the \"maroon\" pattern turned out to be the rule. If a separator in the base grid is black, and the original input is colored, then maroon is needed. If the base separator is already orange, we keep the original.\n\nSo, the test input has *active* corners and *inactive* center/edges. Active corners generate a specific tiled grid, and inactive middle prevents maroon blocks. Now I can predict a grid of black squares outlined by orange lines and make the output for the test input.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid.\nBased on the examples, we can identify the following rules:\n\n1.  **Output Grid Structure**: The 16x16 output is a 5x5 grid of 2x2 \"tiles\" separated by 1-pixel wide \"separators\" (lines).\n    *   Separator rows are at indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n    *   Separator columns are at indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n    *   Tile rows are at indices 1-2, 4-5, 7-8, 10-11, 13-14.\n    *   Tile columns are at indices 1-2, 4-5, 7-8, 10-11, 13-14.\n\n2.  **Base Grid Style**: The pattern of the \"Background\" (Tiles and Separators) is determined by the **corners** of the 3x3 non-background shape in the input.\n    *   In the examples, the input contains a 3x3 pattern of a specific color (Active) on a background of orange (7).\n    *   If the **corners** of this 3x3 pattern are **Inactive** (background color 7), as in Example 1:\n        *   Tiles are filled with Orange (7).\n        *   Separators are Black (0).\n    *   If the **corners** of this 3x3 pattern are **Active** (non-7), as in Examples 2 and 3:\n        *   Tiles are empty/Black (0).\n        *   Separators are Orange (7).\n    *   *Refinement for Separators*: In Example 2, horizontal separators were 0. This correlates with the \"Side Edges\" of the input pattern being active. In Example 3 and the Test Input, the Side Edges are inactive (background color), so the separators form a complete grid (Orange).\n\n3.  **Maroon Overlay**: A maroon (9) overlay is applied to the **central 3x3 block** of the output grid (centered at tile T(2,2)) based on the **cross** (center + 4 neighbors) of the input pattern.\n    *   The corners of the input pattern do not generate maroon tiles (seen in Examples 2 and 3).\n    *   The maroon color appears when a component (Center Tile or surrounding Separator) corresponds to an **Active** pixel in the input cross, and the base color of that component is Black (0).\n    *   In the **Test Input**, the 3x3 pattern has **Active** corners (Color 2) but an **Inactive** center and cross (Color 7).\n        *   Pattern: `2 7 2` / `7 7 7` / `2 7 2`.\n        *   Since the Cross is entirely inactive, **no maroon overlay** will be generated.\n\n**Application to Test Input**:\n*   **Base Grid**: The corners are active (2), so the Tiles are Black (0) and Separators are Orange (7). Side edges are inactive, so the grid is complete (boxed).\n*   **Overlay**: The center and neighbors are inactive (7), so no pixels change to 9.\n\nThe resulting grid is a pattern of empty black boxes surrounded by orange lines.\n\n**Output Grid Construction**:\n*   **Separator Rows** (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15): `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n*   **Tile Rows** (1, 2, 4, 5, etc.): `7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7`\n\noutput:\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

A **fixed centered 6\u00d76 window** (rows 6\u201311 and cols 6\u201311, 1-indexed) where every **0** in that window is recolored to **9** (leaving 7 unchanged).  \n   This is why the \u201cred\u201d area always appears in the same place and looks like the base pattern but with 0\u21929 inside that window.\n\n### How to choose the base pattern (from the input symbol)\n\nLook at the 3\u00d73 bounding box of the non-7 pixels and check the **edge-centers** of that 3\u00d73 (top-middle, left-middle, right-middle, bottom-middle):\n\n- **4 edge-centers present** (a \u201c+\u201d): base is a grid of 7 \u201ccells\u201d separated by 0 lines (Example 1).\n- **2 edge-centers present** (left & right only, like an \u201cH\u201d spine): base has vertical 7 stripes on a 0 field (Example 2).\n- **0 edge-centers present** (only corners/diagonal structure): base is the cross-hatch/checker pattern (Example 3).\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\nTest input has 2\u2019s only at the **four corners** of a 3\u00d73 box, so **no edge-centers are occupied** \u21d2 choose the **cross-hatch/checker** base pattern (same category as Example 3).  \nThen recolor **0\u21929** inside the centered 6\u00d76 window.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid (16\u00d716)\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "### Observations from the solved examples\n\n1. **All outputs are always 16\u00d716** and use only colors **0, 7, 9**.\n2. Each output is made of two layers:\n   - **A repeating 0/7 background template** with period 3 (so rows/cols with index \u2261 1 mod 3 behave like \u201cgrid lines\u201d).\n   - A **fixed centered 6\u00d76 square** (rows 6\u201311, cols 6\u201311 in 1-based indexing) where **every background-0 cell is changed to 9** (background-7 cells stay 7).  \n     This explains why the red (9) area looks different depending on the template: it is simply \u201c0\u21929\u201d inside that central square.\n\n3. There are **three possible 0/7 templates** (the only difference between example outputs is which template is chosen):\n   - **Template A (example 1):** 0 on every \u201cgridline row or column\u201d (r\u22611 mod3 OR c\u22611 mod3), 7 elsewhere.\n   - **Template B (example 2):** vertical stripes: 7 only on \u201cgridline columns\u201d but not on \u201cgridline rows\u201d.\n   - **Template C (example 3):** checker weave:  \n     `7` exactly when *(r\u22611 mod3) XOR (c\u22611 mod3)*, else `0`.\n\n4. **How the template is selected:**  \n   Compare the foreground (non\u20117) pixels in the input:\n   - If the foreground has **no orthogonal adjacency** (pixels are isolated/only diagonally related), the output matches **Template C** (example 3).\n   - (Other cases match the other templates, but for this test we only need this branch.)\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\nThe test input has four `2` pixels, and **none of them touch orthogonally** (all are separated by at least one cell).  \nSo we choose **Template C** (same template as example 3), then apply the fixed central 6\u00d76 \u201c0\u21929\u201d replacement.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid (16\u00d716)\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Test Input Solution for ARC Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break down this ARC problem. The goal is to figure out the pattern transformation from a 6x6 input grid to a 16x16 output grid, given three examples. I'm focusing on the Test Input now.\n\n**Analysis**\nAll the inputs have a background color (orange) and a foreground shape made of another color. The main structure of the output seems to be a grid of cells. The size of the output is fixed at 16x16. Also, a specific background grid appears (Dashed or Solid).\n\nThe challenge is how the foreground shape translates into the output. From the given examples, it seems the foreground shape is \"repositioned toward the center\" and the foreground's color becomes \"red\". I need to identify which grid pattern is created by the Test Input.\n\n**Test Input**\nInput has a shape that is just 4 corners: 2 . 2 / . . . / 2 . 2.  There are a few key points:\n- the background is all the cells that aren't the shape\n- the shape is in the $3 \\times 3$ area in the center\n\n**Output Structure**\n\nThe output is always a $5 \\times 5$ grid of \"blocks.\" Each block is 2x2, separated by a 1-pixel-wide border. The border is either black or orange depending on the lattice. Each $2 \\times 2$ block represents a region in the input where the shape exists. These are described in block form by the $5 \\times 5$ output.\n\n**Lattice**\n\nThe \"orange lattice on black\" refers to the border and block interior colors.  The background lattice type changes with input shape. I hypothesize that the background lattice is related to the connectivity of the input shape.\n\n* The Test Input has the characteristic that it's disconnected, i.e., corners only.\n* Thus, the background structure (lattice) would have a dashed orange grid where the vertical and horizontal separators between the $2 \\times 2$ blocks have grid lines with 7s between intersections and 0s at the intersections. The blocks are always set to a color 0.\n\n**Foreground Transformation (Red)**\n\nIn each Example, the shape color, or the \"foreground\", is transformed to red in the output. The key part is that the output has a specific \"red\" pattern. The red color only appears in a specific pattern within the output blocks/intersections.\n\n* Because the Test input shape is made of corner elements only. And the pattern is $2 . 2$.\n* When a 2 is present, there is a red segment for each corner of the block towards the center.\n*  Middle $2 \\times 2$ blocks remain empty.\n* Based on the pattern, I predict the red portions on the blocks correspond to an inverted or filled pattern with the corners of a rectangle.\n\n**Final Algorithm**\n1.  **Read input**\n2.  **Reposition** The input has a shape in the $6 \\times 6$. The $5 \\times 5$ blocks of the output will represent the shape in the middle. The plan is the shape is mapped directly to the center of the $5 \\times 5$ output.\n3.  **Output Background** Based on the examples and the shape type:\n    *   Set all of the background of the 2x2 blocks to a value 0 (Black).\n    *   Set the vertical and horizontal separators between these blocks.\n    *   Intersections between the $2 \\times 2$ blocks are filled with a 0.\n    *   All vertical and horizontal separators that touch each block are set to 7 (Orange).\n4. **Foreground** The original color of the shape will be translated to red.\n    * Based on the shape and existing logic, 0s are at B(2,2).\n    * Set the bottom, the center, and the top most block rows of the blocks to include 9 (Red) to produce the pattern `...0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0...`\n5. **Output** Return the generated $16 \\times 16$ output grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a $6 \\times 6$ input grid into a $16 \\times 16$ output grid.\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation involves the following logic:\n\n1.  **Output Structure**: The output is a $5 \\times 5$ grid of $2 \\times 2$ \"macro-blocks\" separated by 1-pixel borders (grid lines). This accounts for the size: $5 \\times 2$ (blocks) $+ 6 \\times 1$ (borders) $= 16$ pixels.\n2.  **Background Lattice**: The style of the background (blocks and borders) depends on the properties of the foreground shape in the input.\n    *   **Example 1**: Solid orange (7) blocks with black (0) borders. (Input shape: Cross).\n    *   **Example 2**: Black (0) blocks with solid orange (7) borders. (Input shape: Square/H with filled corners).\n    *   **Example 3**: Black (0) blocks with \"dashed\" orange (7) borders (intersections are black). (Input shape: X with filled corners, but no side adjacencies).\n    *   **Test Input**: The shape consists of 4 disjoint points (corners of a $3 \\times 3$ square). Like Ex 2 and 3, the corners are filled, and sides are empty. Thus, it follows the **Example 3 background style** (Dashed Orange Grid).\n        *   Separator Rows: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, ...`\n        *   Content Rows: `7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, ...`\n\n3.  **Foreground (Red Shape)**: The input shape is repositioned to the center of the grid and recolored red (9). The \"Red\" pattern seems to be a specific overlay applied to the $3 \\times 3$ center area of the output blocks.\n    *   The shape is effectively a $3 \\times 3$ boolean grid.\n    *   The corresponding output rows show a \"filled\" representation where a row like `X 0 X` (gap in middle) results in a specific red pattern: `0 9` in the left block, `9 9` in the center block, and `9 0` in the right block. This fills the gap.\n    *   **Ex 2 and Ex 3** both produce this pattern for their top and bottom rows (`1 0 1` and `6 0 6`). The Test Input's top and bottom rows are `2 0 2`, which is structurally identical.\n    *   **Middle Row**: In Ex 2 (`1 1 1`) and Ex 3 (`0 6 0`), there is content connecting the top and bottom, leading to red in the middle rows and separators. In the **Test Input**, the middle row is `0 0 0` (empty). Therefore, the middle block row (Blocks 7,8) and the surrounding separator rows (Rows 6, 9) will likely remain \"clean\" (background only), creating two distinct horizontal bars of red.\n\n**Predicted Output Construction:**\n*   **Background**: Dashed Orange Grid (like Ex 3).\n*   **Top Bar (Row 5)**: Applies the red pattern `0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0` to the content row.\n*   **Bottom Bar (Row 10)**: Applies the same red pattern.\n*   **Middle (Row 6-9)**: Remains background pattern (empty middle).\n\nOutput Grid:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nWait, checking the row indices carefully.\nRow 0: Separator (Sep 0).\nRows 1-2: Block Row 0.\nRow 3: Sep 1.\nRows 4-5: Block Row 1.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's what I've figured out about this ARC problem. It looks like we're dealing with three examples of an image transformation, along with a new test case. The goal is to deduce the rules of this transformation. I'm going to break it down, step by step.**\n\nThe initial data shows a grid transformation from a smaller input (6x6) to a bigger output (16x16). I've got to analyze how the colors and shapes get repositioned and changed. The \"hints\" mention things about how the background should be a \u201clattice\u201d - and that the foreground pixels get replaced. Let's dig deeper:\n\n*   **Grid Structure:** The first thing I noticed is that the output grid isn't just a simple zoom. It looks like each input pixel is being stretched out or tiled. I deduced a conceptual 5x5 grid structure within the 16x16 output: where a 3x3 block is created for each 2x2 section of the original grid, with a one-pixel border between these blocks. I suspect there's also some shifting and mirroring depending on the pattern.\n*   **Foreground and Background:** The color change is a central piece. The shapes and colors of the input images get switched up in the output. Based on this, there are probably three different patterns for what makes the background, and based on the shapes, there should be a rule for changing the background pattern.\n*   **The \"Lattice\" Pattern:** I had to really understand the \"orange lattice on black\" hint. This means orange blocks separated by black lines, but I realized that it can be applied to many different patterns. In one example the orange lines are vertical, but it makes no difference to the output.\n*   **The Mysterious \"9\":** There is a unique color appearing in the output - a maroon-like color called \"9\". It seems to form a frame or border around a central area, and based on the input shapes, it looks like it gets \"drawn\" around, but not actually created by the initial data. This rule is applied on the conceptual grid that I defined previously.\n*   **Shape Analysis:** I've noticed a recurring pattern in the shapes of the example inputs - they are all roughly 3x3 pixel areas. Also, they all have a \"center pixel\" and also some edge pixels and corners. I think the shape affects what background design is made.\n*   **Background Patterns:** Looking at the three example inputs, there seem to be three patterns - Orange Squares, Vertical Orange Lines and, well, Orange outlines around black shapes. There is a method to figuring this out: based on the image's overall shape.\n\n**The Background Pattern Derivation**:\n\nBased on my analysis of the backgrounds, here is what I found.\n\n*   The Background Pattern depends on the number of \"walls\" on each input shape.\n*   The Background is based on 3 shapes, based on which pattern to apply.\n\nThe background pattern is made in the output, and is modified by an overlay.\n\n**The \"9\" Overlay Rule**:\n\nNow, about this maroon \"9\" and how it gets placed:\n\n*   The '9's are a result of applying an overlay.\n*   This overlay is applied to the 5x5 section of the 16x16 grid, which is 6 rows, 6 columns.\n\n**Putting It Together**\n\nHere's my general understanding:\n\n1.  Construct a 16x16 grid.\n2.  Based on the input image's shape and color, choose the proper background pattern.\n3.  Then, in the 5x5 conceptual section (indices 5-10 for rows and columns), convert any black pixels to the color \"9\".\n\n**Now, For The Test Input:**\n\n1.  The test input's shape is just four corners of a 3x3 pixel area. Color 2.\n2.  Based on this input shape, the appropriate background is derived - which will be horizontal lines.\n3.  Next, based on the process above - apply the rule in the 5x5 area and change black areas to color 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBased on the information above, I predict the output image.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid.\nBased on the solved examples and hints, we can deduce the following logic:\n\n1.  **Output Structure:** The 16x16 output grid conceptually represents a 5x5 grid of 2x2 cells separated by 1-pixel borders.\n    -   Pixel coordinates $(y, x)$ in the output map to grid coordinates:\n        -   $y = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15$ are **Horizontal Border Rows**.\n        -   $y = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8...$ are **Cell Rows**.\n        -   Similarly for columns.\n\n2.  **Background Pattern Generation:** The background pattern depends on the color of the foreground shape in the input.\n    -   **Input Color 3 (Green) [Ex 1]:** Filled Orange Cells.\n        -   Cells (y%3!=0, x%3!=0) are Orange (7).\n        -   Borders are Black (0).\n    -   **Input Color 1 (Blue) [Ex 2]:** Vertical Orange Lines.\n        -   Vertical Borders (x%3==0, except intersections) are Orange (7).\n        -   Horizontal Borders and Cells are Black (0).\n    -   **Input Color 6 (Magenta) [Ex 3]:** Grid Lines (Vertical + Horizontal).\n        -   All Borders (x%3==0 or y%3==0, except intersections) are Orange (7).\n        -   Cells are Black (0).\n    -   **Test Input Color 2 (Red):** Based on Color Arithmetic (Red + Blue = Magenta $\\rightarrow$ Horizontal + Vertical = Grid), Color 2 corresponds to **Horizontal Orange Lines**.\n        -   Horizontal Borders (y%3==0, except intersections) are Orange (7).\n        -   Vertical Borders and Cells are Black (0).\n\n    **Background Pattern for Test Input (Horizontal Lines):**\n    -   **Rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 (Border Rows):** `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`. (0 at intersections, 7 on line segments).\n    -   **All other rows (Cell Rows):** `0, 0, 0...` (All Black).\n\n3.  **Foreground Overlay:** A \"Maroon (9)\" overlay is applied to the background in a specific central region, representing the transformed shape.\n    -   The input shape is ignored except for its color (used above) and potentially its existence which triggers the overlay.\n    -   The overlay region is always the 6x6 area covering the \"borders\" around the central cell (2,2) of the 5x5 grid.\n    -   **Region:** Rows 5 through 10, Columns 5 through 10.\n    -   **Rule:** Inside this region, change any **Black (0)** pixel to **Maroon (9)**. Leave **Orange (7)** pixels unchanged.\n\n4.  **Applying Logic to Test Input:**\n    -   **Color:** 2 (Red) $\\rightarrow$ Background is Horizontal Orange Lines.\n    -   **Background Construction:**\n        -   Rows 0, 3, 12, 15 are `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`.\n        -   Rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14 are all `0`.\n        -   Rows 6, 9 are Border Rows (like Row 0).\n    -   **Overlay Application (Rows 5-10, Cols 5-10):**\n        -   **Rows 5, 7, 8, 10:** Background is all `0`. In cols 5-10, `0` becomes `9`.\n            -   Result: `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`.\n        -   **Rows 6, 9:** Background is `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0...`.\n            -   Columns 5-10 values: `7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7` (Indices: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).\n            -   Apply 0->9: `7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7`.\n            -   Result: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`.\n\nThis yields the final grid.\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation from the examples:\n\n1. **Background pattern**: The output creates a 16x16 lattice with separators at every 3rd row/column. The specific pattern of 0s and 7s depends on whether the input shape has a \"full middle row\" or \"full middle column\":\n   - If both \u2192 separators are 0, cells are 7 (Example 1)\n   - If neither \u2192 pattern alternates where separator positions XOR determines the value (Example 3)\n\n2. **Foreground transformation**: The non-orange shape becomes red (9), is repositioned to center, and marks boundaries/connections between filled cells.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\nThe shape (2s) is at positions (0,2), (0,4), (2,2), (2,4) - forming four corners:\n```\nX . X\n. . .\nX . X\n```\n\nThis has NO full middle row (row 1 is empty) and NO full middle column (col 1 is empty), so it follows Example 3's lattice pattern.\n\n**Determining the 9 positions:**\n- Filled cells: (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3) in the 5x5 cell grid\n- \"Between\" cells (connecting filled cells): (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)\n- Cell (2,2) is NOT between any filled cells in the same row/column\n\nFor each cell with 9s:\n- Corner cells (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3): 9 at inner corner\n- Edge cells (1,2), (3,2): 9 spanning full row (bottom/top)\n- Edge cells (2,1), (2,3): 9 at inner column only\n\nSince (2,2) has no 9s, separator intersections (6,6), (6,9), (9,6), (9,9) remain background.\n\n**Final output:**\n\n```\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,0,0,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,0,0,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\nThe image shows **three** input\u2192output pairs.\n\n### Inputs (all three)\n* Each input is a **square grid** whose **dominant/background color is orange**.\n* Each input contains a **single foreground color** (non-orange) forming a simple blocky shape:\n  * **Input 1:** a **green** orthogonal \u201cplus/cross\u201d-like connected shape, located toward the **lower-right** area.\n  * **Input 2:** a **blue** shape resembling an **\u201cH\u201d** (two vertical bars connected by a middle bar), roughly **centered**.\n  * **Input 3:** several **magenta/pink** small blocks arranged in a **symmetric cluster** near the **center** (appearing as multiple small squares with gaps between them rather than one large solid block).\n\n### Outputs (all three)\n* Each output is a **square grid** dominated by **black**.\n* Across the output, there is a **regular repeating pattern** of **orange** blocks/cells (looks like an evenly spaced lattice of orange separated by black).\n* Each output contains a **red** shape near the **center**:\n  * Output 1: red **plus/cross**-like shape.\n  * Output 2: red **H**-like shape.\n  * Output 3: a small red cluster near the center (shape corresponds to the input\u2019s magenta arrangement, though fine details are hard to read).\n\n### What changes from input \u2192 output\n* The **foreground shape color** changes (green/blue/magenta \u2192 **red**).\n* The **background** changes from **solid orange** to a **black field** with a **regular orange grid/lattice**.\n* The **foreground position** changes at least in Pair 1 (from **lower-right** \u2192 **center** in the output).\n\n### What stays the same\n* The **basic geometry/type** of the foreground shape appears preserved (plus stays plus; H stays H).\n* The outputs consistently use the same **three main colors**: **black + orange pattern + red foreground**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n* **Object movement:** **present** (Pair 1 clearly shifts the object to center)\n* **Object recoloring:** **present** (foreground becomes red; background treatment changes)\n* **Bordering / outlining:** **maybe** (black looks like \u201cgridlines\u201d/separators around orange cells)\n* **Filling holes or cavities:** **maybe** (unclear whether any cavities are filled vs. just hard to see)\n* **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** **maybe** (only the main foreground structure is represented; no obvious noise examples)\n* **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** **present** (foreground seems extracted and re-placed)\n* **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center):** **maybe** (centering behavior suggested)\n* **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** **maybe** (orange is dominant in inputs; foreground is rare)\n* **Size-based filtering or selection:** **maybe** (likely only the main/only foreground is used)\n* **Symmetry or reflection operations:** **absent**\n* **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** **maybe** (output rendering could imply resampling/upscaling)\n* **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** **maybe** (shape looks preserved, but rendered into a stylized/patterned \u201cboard\u201d)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **Foreground color is discarded:** the input\u2019s non-orange color varies (green/blue/magenta) but the output foreground is **always red**, implying \u201cforeground = any non-background.\u201d\n2. **Foreground location is not preserved:** at least one example shows the shape being **recentered** rather than kept where it was found.\n3. **Background is converted into a structured texture:** the uniform orange field becomes a **regular orange-on-black lattice**, suggesting the output canvas is produced by a **systematic resampling / inserting black separators**, not by copying the background directly.\n4. **The orange lattice seems shape-independent:** the same kind of orange/black pattern appears in every output regardless of which foreground shape is present.\n5. **Multiple pieces likely move together:** the input 3 foreground looks like multiple small components; the output shows a central red cluster rather than scattering them, suggesting components are treated as a **group** (one composite foreground).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nMost likely: identify the **background color** (orange) and treat **all other colors as foreground**. Create a new output canvas with a **black grid-like separator pattern** and **orange \u201ccells\u201d** at regular positions, then **recolor the extracted foreground to red** and **place it centered** on this patterned canvas (preserving its shape/relative layout).\n\nAlternate close family: the task may **upsample** the scene by inserting black rows/columns (and possibly a border), then **translate** the foreground to the center while rendering the background only at the \u201ccell centers\u201d (producing the orange lattice).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks you would perform when solving\n\n1. **Dimension/parity check:** test if output size relates to input as `2n\u00b11` and whether orange appears only on coordinates of a single parity class (e.g., odd/odd), indicating inserted separator rows/cols.\n2. **Foreground extraction check:** verify that \u201cforeground = all non-background cells\u201d and that all such cells become **red** in the output.\n3. **Centering check:** compute the foreground bounding box in input vs output; verify the output foreground bbox is centered (and whether centering is by bbox-center, centroid, or aligning to a fixed anchor).\n4. **Background pattern check:** confirm the orange/black lattice is constant across examples and determine whether it depends only on output dimensions (not on the input shape).\n5. **Multi-component preservation:** if input foreground has multiple disconnected components, verify whether their **relative offsets** are preserved when placed in the output.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* Treat the input as **orange background + non-orange foreground**; the foreground\u2019s original color is **ignored** and becomes **red**.\n* The foreground shape is **repositioned toward the center** (not kept at its original location).\n* The output background is a **regular orange lattice on black**, suggesting **inserted separators / resampling** rather than a solid fill.\n* If the foreground has multiple parts, they likely move as **one grouped arrangement** and keep their relative layout.\nHINT_END",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The ARC Challenge: Deciphering the Pattern**\n\nAlright, here's the deal. I'm looking at these examples, trying to wrap my head around this ARC task. They give me some grids, and I've got to figure out a pattern that transforms the input to the output.\n\nFirst, I examined Example 1: a 6x6 grid with a green cross in the corner. The output's a 16x16 grid with a repeating tile. I quickly realized there's a 3x3 pattern at play. It's built up of 0s and 7s. In the example, the cross shape affects the center and creates 9s in a central 6x6 block (rows 6-11, cols 6-11). I spent time verifying these index ranges. From observing, the 3x3 pattern is `0 0 0`, `0 7 7`, `0 7 7`. If we had to label a 0-based index. These are rows 0, 1, and 2.\n\nNext, Example 2: a blue diamond, same game. I noticed a distinct pattern, `0 0 0`, `7 0 0`, `7 0 0`. Also, I'm watching the numbers, but I quickly realized that is not the determining pattern.\n\nWith Example 3, a magenta X, it's a bit of a twist, `0 7 7`, `7 0 0`, `7 0 0`. The patterns are starting to look like they're related to bitwise operations.\n\nThen, there's a test case, red with 4 corners. Here, it seems a pattern is built for the specific color.\n\nThe main clue is that the color and the shape are linked. I started to make observations of bits. This is because 1, 3, 6, looked like a representation of a digit in binary.\n\nSo it all boiled down to this: The template's the key. Each color corresponds to its own set of bits.\n\nThe key to the solution is the 3x3 pattern I mentioned.\nA pattern of a color N is XOR'd together (bits as binary 1s/0s). This makes each pattern unique.\n\n*   1 (001): `0 0 0`, `7 0 0`, `7 0 0`\n*   3 (011): `0 0 0`, `0 7 7`, `0 7 7`\n*   6 (110): `0 7 7`, `7 0 0`, `7 0 0`\n\nThese 3 patterns help.\nAnd the color code, with bits, makes sense now.\n\nHere's the pattern:\nThe color translates to bit operations and each of these bits results in a new pattern.\n\nI had to decipher the pattern for color 2:\n\n2 (010).  So, I had to work out how to use the above base patterns to get this pattern. The basis of 1, 3, 6 led me to believe I could XOR or use the properties of this space.\n\nBecause 3 = 1 XOR 2. Then P(3) = P(1) XOR P(2). So P(2) is, therefore, P(1) XOR P(3).\n\nSo to find P(2), the test color pattern.\nP(2): 0 XOR 0, 1 XOR 6, 1 XOR 6, gave me `0 0 0`, `7 7 7`, `7 7 7`.\n\nNow to build the 16x16:\nI knew 0 is the top, 7 is the rest. In a grid, I start at the top, fill this in and replace the central block.\n\nGrid is 0, 7, 7 vertically for the whole grid, repeated, then in a central block change the 0's to 9's: So rows 6-10 cols 6-10.\n\n*   Build the 16x16 by tiling the 3x3 pattern: 0 0 0, 7 7 7, 7 7 7.\n*   In the center block (rows 5 to 10 and cols 5 to 10), change all 0s to 9s.\n\nAnd that's it!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid. The transformation involves creating a background pattern based on the input's foreground object and then applying a specific modification to a central 6x6 area.\n\n### 1. Analyzing the Input and Pattern Generation\nThe core of the transformation is the generation of a 3x3 \"lattice template\" or base pattern, which is then repeated to fill the 16x16 grid. The choice of this pattern depends on the color of the single non-7 (non-background) object in the input.\n\nLet's deduce the mapping from the input color to the 3x3 pattern by examining the solved examples. We can interpret the rows of the 3x3 pattern as 3-bit numbers (where 0 is bit 0 and 7 is bit 1). Let's read these rows as Little Endian values (column 0 is the least significant bit, column 2 is the most significant).\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input Color:** 3 (Green)\n    *   **Output Pattern:**\n        *   Row 0: `0 0 0` -> Value 0\n        *   Row 1: `0 7 7` -> Binary `0 1 1` (Little Endian) -> Value 6\n        *   Row 2: `0 7 7` -> Binary `0 1 1` (Little Endian) -> Value 6\n    *   **Vector:** `[0, 6, 6]`\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input Color:** 1 (Blue)\n    *   **Output Pattern:**\n        *   Row 0: `0 0 0` -> Value 0\n        *   Row 1: `7 0 0` -> Binary `1 0 0` (Little Endian) -> Value 1\n        *   Row 2: `7 0 0` -> Binary `1 0 0` (Little Endian) -> Value 1\n    *   **Vector:** `[0, 1, 1]`\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input Color:** 6 (Magenta)\n    *   **Output Pattern:**\n        *   Row 0: `0 7 7` -> Value 6\n        *   Row 1: `7 0 0` -> Value 1\n        *   Row 2: `7 0 0` -> Value 1\n    *   **Vector:** `[6, 1, 1]`\n\n**Hypothesis:** The pattern vector $P(N)$ for a color $N$ behaves linearly with respect to the bitwise XOR operation. That is, $P(A \\oplus B) = P(A) \\oplus P(B)$.\n\nLet's test this with the known values:\n$P(3) = P(1 \\oplus 2) = P(1) \\oplus P(2)$\nWe know $P(3) = [0, 6, 6]$ and $P(1) = [0, 1, 1]$.\nWe can solve for $P(2)$:\n$P(2) = P(3) \\oplus P(1)$\nRow 0: $0 \\oplus 0 = 0$\nRow 1: $6 \\oplus 1 = 7$ (Binary `110` XOR `001` = `111`)\nRow 2: $6 \\oplus 1 = 7$\n\nSo, the pattern vector for Color 2 should be `[0, 7, 7]`.\nConverting these values back to rows:\n*   Row 0 (Value 0): `0 0 0`\n*   Row 1 (Value 7, `111` binary): `7 7 7`\n*   Row 2 (Value 7, `111` binary): `7 7 7`\n\nThe resulting 3x3 base pattern for the **Test Input (Color 2)** is:\n```\n0, 0, 0\n7, 7, 7\n7, 7, 7\n```\n\n### 2. Constructing the Grid\n**Step 1: Background Tiling**\nWe fill the 16x16 grid by repeating the 3x3 pattern derived above.\n*   Rows where `row_index % 3 == 0` will correspond to pattern row 0: `0, 0, 0, ...` (All 0s).\n*   Rows where `row_index % 3 == 1` will correspond to pattern row 1: `7, 7, 7, ...` (All 7s).\n*   Rows where `row_index % 3 == 2` will correspond to pattern row 2: `7, 7, 7, ...` (All 7s).\n\nThis creates horizontal stripes: one row of 0s followed by two rows of 7s.\n\n**Step 2: Central Modification**\nThe problem specifies a \"fixed central 6x6 block\" (rows 6-11, cols 6-11 in 1-based indexing, which corresponds to indices 5-10 in 0-based indexing).\nIn this region (rows 5-10, cols 5-10):\n*   Change every `0` to `9`.\n*   Leave every `7` as `7`.\n\nLet's apply this to the relevant rows (indices 5 to 10):\n*   **Row 5** (`index % 3 = 2`): All 7s. No changes.\n*   **Row 6** (`index % 3 = 0`): All 0s. The segment in cols 5-10 becomes `9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9`. The rest remains `0`.\n*   **Row 7** (`index % 3 = 1`): All 7s. No changes.\n*   **Row 8** (`index % 3 = 2`): All 7s. No changes.\n*   **Row 9** (`index % 3 = 0`): All 0s. The segment in cols 5-10 becomes `9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9`.\n*   **Row 10** (`index % 3 = 1`): All 7s. No changes.\n\n### Final Grid Structure\n*   **Rows 0, 3, 12, 15:** All `0`.\n*   **Rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14:** All `7`.\n*   **Rows 6, 9:** `0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0`.\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's the breakdown of my thought process for solving this ARC task:**\n\nI'm given three examples and a test input for an ARC task, and I need to figure out the pattern to generate the output from the input. My focus is on understanding the input/output relationships and identifying the underlying rules.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Hypothesis Generation:**\n\n*   I start by analyzing the example inputs and outputs, paying attention to grid sizes, colors used, and any patterns in the pixel arrangement.\n*   I notice that the output grids are always 16x16, with some central modification. The key seems to be a repeating \"tile\" pattern.\n*   I hypothesize that a 3x3 \"tile\" is repeated across the grid, and then a 6x6 central area is modified. This is consistent across Example 1, 2, 3.\n\n**Tile Pattern Inference and Refinement:**\n\n*   I look at the tile patterns in each example, trying to understand how the tile is derived from the input.\n*   I carefully examine the relationship between the colors in the input (background and foreground) and the colors in the output tile (0, 7, and 9).\n*   I test out several ideas to encode the color and shapes into the Tile by looking at their Binary representations in LE.\n*   I initially think the tile is a simple transformation or \"mask\" of the input shape, but I then explore the possibility of a direct numerical relationship between the input color value and the tile structure.\n\n**Formalizing the Rule:**\n\n*   I test several hypotheses relating to color values: if tiles are a direct mapping of the input shape? And if the Tile is a mask related to the Foreground color?\n\n*   I discover a rule:\n    *   Row 0 of Tile: If input color (C) is even, value = C. If C is odd, value = 0.\n    *   Rows 1 and 2 of Tile: If C is odd or zero, value is a constant 1. Else, this is 6.\n\n**Application and Verification:**\n\n*   I apply the extracted rule to the test input (color 2), predicting a tile pattern.\n*   I generate the 16x16 grid based on the tile and apply the central modification (replace 0 with 9 in the 6x6 central area).\n*   I carefully check this against the prompt that describes the central modification on Row and Column 5-10.\n*   I've gone through all the steps to encode the pattern: *Create tile* then *fill the pattern*.\n\nThis whole process is a loop of hypothesis generation, testing, refinement, and verification. I try to be methodical and rigorous, constantly checking my assumptions and making sure my rules are consistent across all examples. This leads me to a workable solution.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we need to infer the rules for generating a 16x16 output grid from a 6x6 input grid.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Input Identification:**\n    The input grids contain a specific foreground object on a background of color 7. The foreground object has a specific color (1, 2, 3, 6, etc.) and shape (cross, diamond, etc.).\n    *   Example 1: Color 3 (Green), Shape Cross.\n    *   Example 2: Color 1 (Blue), Shape Diamond/Square-like.\n    *   Example 3: Color 6 (Magenta), Shape X.\n    *   Test Input: Color 2 (Red), Shape 3x3 Rectangular corners.\n\n2.  **Output Structure:**\n    The output is a 16x16 grid. It consists of a base pattern repeated across the grid, with a specific modification in the center.\n    *   **Base Pattern:** A 3x3 tile is repeated to fill the grid (16x16). The tile consists of the background color 7 and color 0.\n    *   **Central Modification:** A fixed 6x6 region in the center of the grid (Rows 5-10, Columns 5-10, using 0-based indexing) has its 0s replaced by 9s. The 7s remain unchanged.\n\n3.  **Determining the 3x3 Tile:**\n    We need to deduce the 3x3 tile pattern from the input foreground object. Let's analyze the rows of the tiles in the examples, interpreting them as 3-bit Little Endian binary numbers (where `7` represents a bit set to 1, and `0` represents 0).\n    *   **Example 1 (Color 3):**\n        Tile Rows: `0 0 0`, `0 7 7`, `0 7 7`.\n        Binary (LE): `000` (0), `011` (6), `011` (6).\n        Input Color: 3 (Odd).\n    *   **Example 2 (Color 1):**\n        Tile Rows: `0 0 0`, `7 0 0`, `7 0 0`.\n        Binary (LE): `000` (0), `1 0 0` (1), `1 0 0` (1).\n        Input Color: 1 (Odd).\n    *   **Example 3 (Color 6):**\n        Tile Rows: `0 7 7`, `7 0 0`, `7 0 0`.\n        Binary (LE): `0 1 1` (6), `1 0 0` (1), `1 0 0` (1).\n        Input Color: 6 (Even).\n\n    **Rule for Tile Generation:**\n    Based on the input foreground color $C$:\n    *   **Row 0:** If $C$ is **Even**, Row 0 represents $C$ (in Little Endian binary). If $C$ is **Odd**, Row 0 is 0.\n        *   Ex 3 ($C=6$, Even) -> Row 0 is 6 (`0 7 7`). Matches.\n        *   Ex 1 ($C=3$, Odd) -> Row 0 is 0 (`0 0 0`). Matches.\n        *   Ex 2 ($C=1$, Odd) -> Row 0 is 0 (`0 0 0`). Matches.\n    *   **Rows 1 & 2:** The value depends on $C$.\n        *   If $C=1$, Value is 1 (`7 0 0`).\n        *   If $C=6$, Value is 1 (`7 0 0`).\n        *   If $C=3$, Value is 6 (`0 7 7`).\n        *   Observation: For the majority (1 and 6), the value is 1. For 3, it is 6. The logic seems to be a specific mapping or toggle. Given the data, we assume the default pattern is 1 (`7 0 0`) unless $C=3$.\n\n    **Applying to Test Input (Color 2):**\n    *   Input Color $C = 2$ (Red).\n    *   **Row 0:** 2 is **Even**. Value = 2.\n        *   Binary 2 (Little Endian `010`) -> `0 7 0`.\n    *   **Rows 1 & 2:** Following the pattern of 1 and 6, we use Value = 1.\n        *   Binary 1 (Little Endian `100`) -> `7 0 0`.\n\n    **Resulting Tile for Test Input:**\n    Row 0: `0, 7, 0`\n    Row 1: `7, 0, 0`\n    Row 2: `7, 0, 0`\n\n4.  **Constructing the Grid:**\n    *   Fill 16x16 with the derived tile.\n    *   **Central 6x6 Block (Rows 5-10, Cols 5-10):**\n        Replace every `0` with `9`. Keep `7` as `7`.\n\n    **Grid Construction Details:**\n    *   **Rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15** follow Tile Row 0 (`0,7,0`).\n    *   **Rows 1, 4, 7, 10, 13** follow Tile Row 1 (`7,0,0`).\n    *   **Rows 2, 5, 8, 11, 14** follow Tile Row 2 (`7,0,0`).\n\n    **Applying Modification to Rows 5-10:**\n    *   **Row 5 (Tile Row 2 Pattern `7,0,0`...):**\n        Cols 0-15 base: `7,0,0, 7,0,0, 7,0,0, 7,0,0, 7,0,0, 7`\n        Cols 5-10 mod:\n        Col 5 (0->9), Col 6 (7->7), Col 7 (0->9), Col 8 (0->9), Col 9 (7->7), Col 10 (0->9).\n        Result: `7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7`\n    \n    *   **Row 6 (Tile Row 0 Pattern `0,7,0`...):**\n        Cols 0-15 base: `0,7,0, 0,7,0, 0,7,0, 0,7,0, 0,7,0, 0`\n        Cols 5-10 mod:\n        Col 5 (0->9), Col 6 (0->9), Col 7 (7->7), Col 8 (0->9), Col 9 (0->9), Col 10 (7->7).\n        Result: `0,7,0,0,7,9,9,7,9,9,7,0,0,7,0,0`\n\n    *   **Row 7 (Tile Row 1 Pattern `7,0,0`...):**\n        Same logic as Row 5.\n        Result: `7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7`\n\n    *   **Row 8 (Tile Row 2 Pattern `7,0,0`...):**\n        Same as Row 5/7.\n\n    *   **Row 9 (Tile Row 0 Pattern `0,7,0`...):**\n        Same as Row 6.\n\n    *   **Row 10 (Tile Row 1 Pattern `7,0,0`...):**\n        Same as Row 5/7.\n\n    The rest of the rows remain as the pure repeated tile.\n\n0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,0,0,7,9,9,7,9,9,7,0,0,7,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,0,0,7,9,9,7,9,9,7,0,0,7,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0",

Then, in the fixed central 6\u00d76 block (rows 6\u201311, cols 6\u201311), recolor every 0 to 9 while leaving 7 unchanged. The original input foreground pixels are not copied; only 0,7,9 remain.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1. **Output structure**: All outputs are 16\u00d716 grids with a repeating 3\u00d73 lattice pattern of 0s and 7s.\n\n2. **Central modification**: In all examples, there's a central 6\u00d76 region (rows 5-10, cols 5-10) where all 0s are replaced with 9s, while 7s remain unchanged.\n\n3. **Template selection**: The 3\u00d73 template varies based on the input shape:\n   - Example 1 (Cross/+ shape, color 3): Template `0,0,0 / 0,7,7 / 0,7,7`\n   - Example 2 (H shape, color 1): Template `0,0,0 / 7,0,0 / 7,0,0`  \n   - Example 3 (X/diamond shape, color 6): Template `0,7,7 / 7,0,0 / 7,0,0`\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\nThe test input shows color 2 at positions forming four corners:\n```\n..X.X.\n......\n..X.X.\n```\nThis creates a square/corners pattern - similar to the X shape but without the center cell.\n\n**Template Selection for Test:**\nSince the corners-only pattern is most structurally similar to the X shape (both emphasize diagonal/corner positions rather than orthogonal connections), I'll use Template 3:\n```\n0 7 7\n7 0 0\n7 0 0\n```\n\n**Building the Output:**\n1. Tile the 16\u00d716 grid with Template 3\n2.

Then, in the fixed central 6\u00d76 block (rows 6\u201311, cols 6\u201311), recolor every 0 to 9 while leaving 7 unchanged. The original input foreground pixels are not copied; only 0,7,9 remain.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n1. **All outputs are always 16\u00d716** and are made by **tiling a 3\u00d73 pattern** (period 3 in both directions).  \n2. After that tiling, a **fixed central 6\u00d76 area** (rows 5\u201310 and cols 5\u201310 in 0-based indexing) is modified:  \n   - **every 0 inside that 6\u00d76 becomes 9**\n   - **7 stays 7**\n3. The only thing that varies between examples is **which 3\u00d73 tile (made of 0/7) is chosen**. From the examples, the possible tiles are:\n\n- Tile A (example 1):  \n  \\[\n  \\begin{matrix}\n  0&0&0\\\\\n  0&7&7\\\\\n  0&7&7\n  \\end{matrix}\n  \\]\n- Tile B (example 2):  \n  \\[\n  \\begin{matrix}\n  0&0&0\\\\\n  7&0&0\\\\\n  7&0&0\n  \\end{matrix}\n  \\]\n- Tile C (example 3):  \n  \\[\n  \\begin{matrix}\n  0&7&7\\\\\n  7&0&0\\\\\n  7&0&0\n  \\end{matrix}\n  \\]\n\nA reliable way to pick the tile from the input shape (matching all three examples) is to look at the foreground shape\u2019s **3\u00d73 bounding box** and check two edge-center cells:\n- If the **top-middle** of that 3\u00d73 box is filled \u2192 Tile A  \n- else if the **left-middle** is filled \u2192 Tile B  \n- else \u2192 Tile C\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\nThe color-2 pixels form only the **four corners** of their 3\u00d73 bounding box, so:\n- top-middle is **not** filled\n- left-middle is **not** filled  \n\u21d2 choose **Tile C**.\n\nNow:\n1. Tile **Tile C** across a 16\u00d716 grid.\n2. In rows 5\u201310 and cols 5\u201310, turn **0 \u2192 9**.\n\n### Output grid\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0",

Then, in the fixed central 6\u00d76 block (rows 6\u201311, cols 6\u201311), recolor every 0 to 9 while leaving 7 unchanged.

                "response": "**My Thinking Process: Grids and Objects**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking, based on this task. My goal is to describe what's *in* the grids, nothing more. I need to focus on what I *see*, not what I *think* is going on. I'm avoiding making any assumptions about rules or transformations. I'm strictly sticking to object types and their attributes. And numbers only! No naming colours, just the numeric values. Alright, let's see these grids...\n\nFirst, I notice patterns. There are backgrounds, and then objects on top. In the bigger grids, the backgrounds are interesting. They're built out of colours 0 and 7. They look like a lattice or a grid itself. Sometimes it's 7 as the lines and 0 as the spaces. Sometimes it's flipped. This lattice background is only in the larger examples, though. In a few of the smaller grids, there's just a solid colour 7 background.\n\nThen there are objects placed on top of these backgrounds. The larger grids have a big colour 9 rectangle right in the middle. It's almost like it's covering up the background pattern. In the smaller grids, the objects are different. They're simple shapes made of colours 1, 2, 3, or 6. They look like crosses, diamonds, or maybe an \"X\" or a five-dot pattern. Those are all in the bottom right in the smaller grids.\n\nI can organize this: backgrounds and foreground shapes. The backgrounds use colours 0 and 7 and the foreground shapes are colours 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9. The backgrounds are either a regular pattern or a solid colour. The foreground objects are shapes, either big rectangles or small simple forms. That seems to cover it all.\n\nOkay, here's the description, keeping it general, with no specifics about each grid:\n\nThe grids feature two primary categories of objects: background fields and foreground shapes. The background fields are composed of color 0 and color 7. In larger grids, these form repetitive lattice or mesh-like patterns. In smaller grids, color 7 acts as a solid background. Foreground objects appear as distinct geometric entities. One prominent object is a large rectangular block of color 9 found in the center of the larger grids. Other foreground objects are smaller, simple geometric figures found in the smaller grids. These are colored 1, 2, 3, or 6 and form shapes like crosses, plus signs, diamonds, or quincunxes (five-point arrangements).\n\n`<objects_summary> types: Background structures, Foreground shapes attributes: geometric, repetitive, singular, numeric colors background_colors: 0, 7 foreground_colors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 shapes: lattice, rectangle, cross, diamond, X-shape </objects_summary>`\n\n\nBased on the provided grids, the objects can be categorized into background structures and distinct foreground shapes.\n\n**Background Structures**\nThe most prevalent object type is a background field or pattern.\n*   **Composition:** These are primarily composed of color 0 and color 7.\n*   **Pattern:** In the larger grids, colors 0 and 7 form repetitive, lattice-like, or checkerboard structures. The arrangement varies between grids (e.g., color 7 forming the lines vs. color 0 forming the lines). In the smaller grids, the background appears as a solid field of color 7.\n\n**Foreground Shapes**\nDistinct geometric shapes appear overlaid on or embedded within the background structures. These can be divided into two sub-types based on size and color:\n1.  **Large Rectangular Overlay:**\n    *   **Color:** Color 9.\n    *   **Attributes:** This object appears as a large, central block in the larger grids. It forms a rectangular region that overrides the underlying background pattern. It is solid but spans a significant portion of the grid height and width.\n2.  **Small Geometric Glyphs:**\n    *   **Colors:** Colors 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   **Attributes:** These distinct shapes appear in the smaller grids against a solid background of color 7. They form compact, symmetrical geometric figures such as:\n        *   A cross or plus sign (color 3).\n        *   A diamond shape (color 1).\n        *   An \"X\" or 5-point arrangement (color 6).\n        *   A dispersed cross or dot pattern (color 2).\n\n<objects_summary>\n*   **Background Structures**: Repetitive lattice, mesh, or solid fields composed of colors 0 and 7.\n*   **Foreground Overlay**: Large, central rectangular blocks composed of color 9.\n*   **Small Glyphs**: Compact, symmetrical geometric shapes (crosses, diamonds, X-shapes) composed of colors 1, 2, 3, or 6.\n</objects_summary>",

Then, in the fixed central 6\u00d76 block (rows 6\u201311, cols 6\u201311), recolor every 0 to 9 while leaving 7 unchanged. The original input foreground pixels are not copied; only 0,7,9 remain.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
