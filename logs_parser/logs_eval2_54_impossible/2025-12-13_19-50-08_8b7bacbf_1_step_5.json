            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Solution to the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to tackle this ARC problem. Let me break down my thought process:\n\n**1. Analyze the Examples:**\n\n*   **Initial Impressions:** The core seems to be about identifying a \"special color\" and filling in some shapes with it. I notice a pattern: there are input grids, and the output grids have some internal zeros replaced with another color.\n*   **Deconstructing Example 1:** I carefully study Example 1 to see how this filling happens. There's a \"special color\" (7 in this case), and there are structures made up of other colors like 2, 3, 5, 1. The key is in areas inside the 2 and 3 shapes, the spaces (zeros) have been filled with the special color (7). And there is a small shape with 5s, the same phenomenon.\n    *   **\"Tagging\" of regions:** I look closely at the arrangement of other colors. There's also the presence of '1's in the input, which are placed near the edges of shapes. In Example 1, the areas that are being filled are always close to the '1's.\n    *   **Isolating the Fill Color:** It seems the special \"fill color\" is related to a unique pixel or arrangement of pixels in the input, a unique pixel of color '7'. Is it always the unique pixel?\n*   **Further Validation:** I look at Example 2. In Example 2, the unique color is `4`, so it is the fill color. The area to be filled is a shape made of the color `2`. So the unique pixel determines the color to fill. It appears this \"fill color\" often appears near the edge/corner.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** The basic rule seems to be: Identify a unique color, and fill the closed shape with this unique color if the edge of this shape touches the activator '1'.\n*   **Exploring Edge Cases:** I look at Example 3. I see it uses unique color `4`. The areas inside the closed shape are filled. But I see the shape `3` is not filled, because it is not touching '1'.\n    *   **Activator Verification:** It looks like color '1' always is connected to the area which is to be filled. I see color `1` at the edges of shapes. It appears to always be the \"activator\". I need to think in terms of connectivity, are adjacent shapes affected by '1'?\n\n**2. Refining the hypothesis**\n\n*   **Summarizing the rule:**\n    1.  The special color, `C`, to fill is the unique pixel present in the grid.\n    2.  The \"activator\" color is 1.\n    3.  Find all connected \"Target Shapes\" that are NOT background color. These are all the connected groups of pixels that are of the same non-background color.\n    4.  If a target shape has any pixels that are *adjacent* to an activator '1', then the closed region inside that \"target shape\" is filled by the \"special color\".\n*   **Testing my assumptions:** I looked back at the examples and made sure the rule explained all the changes. It seemed to. But I need a more precise definition of what \"touched by '1'\" means.\n\n**3. Investigating \"Touch\" or \"Adjacency\"**\n\n*   **Exploring Edge Cases:** Example 4 gave me a hiccup. The color 2 was being filled, even though there was a small space between the color 2 and the activator '1'. Does the \"0\" matter?\n    *   **Possible \"Line-of-Sight\" Rule:** I wonder if the \"activator\" color can cast a ray. Does this mean the activators '1' influence shapes that it can \"see\"? The rule looks like this: if you can draw a straight line from color 1 to a target shape, then it is touched.\n\n**4. The 'Test' Input and Revised Understanding**\n\n*   **Test Case Analysis:** Now, I'm working with a new input (30x30). I start identifying all the colors and special colors. The \"fill color\" (called 'Seed') is a unique color in the grid, color `8`. There are activator `1` and a `3`. I will also call `3` the \"pipe\" for now. The \"background color\" looks to be `5` based on pixel count. The user provided hints in earlier discussion.\n    *   **Identifying \"Holes\":** If `5` is background, then any `5` pixels *inside* of other shapes would be considered \"holes\" to be filled.\n    *   **New hypothesis\n\nThe problem asks us to identify a transformation rule based on solved examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Object Identification:** The grids contain background fields (usually `0` or the most frequent color) and foreground objects (connected shapes of other colors).\n2.  **Special Colors:**\n    *   **Activator:** In all examples, the color `1` (blue) appears to act as a \"pointer\" or \"activator\". Shapes adjacent to `1`s are subject to change.\n    *   **Seed/Fill Color:** Each example contains exactly one unique pixel of a specific color (or a distinct seed) that serves as the \"source\" of the fill color.\n        *   Example 1: Unique pixel `7`. Regions inside activator-touched shapes are filled with `7`.\n        *   Example 2: Unique pixel `4`. Regions inside activator-touched shapes are filled with `4`.\n        *   Example 3: Unique pixel `4`. Only shapes touching `1` are filled. Shapes touching `3` (but not `1`) are *not* filled.\n        *   Example 4: Unique pixel `4`. The shape `2` is filled. Although separated by a single `0`, the `1`s are aligned with the shape, or the gap is negligible in the specific logic (or it's considered \"pointed at\").\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Identify the **Background Color** (the dominant field color).\n    *   Identify the **Fill Color** (the unique or \"seed\" color in the grid).\n    *   Identify **Target Shapes** (connected components of non-background, non-activator colors).\n    *   **Condition:** If a Target Shape is adjacent to (or touched by) the **Activator Color (`1`)**, its enclosed \"holes\" (regions of background color strictly inside the shape) are filled with the **Fill Color**.\n    *   Shapes not touching `1` are left unchanged. Open regions (not fully enclosed) are not filled.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Background:** The grid is dominated by `5` (gray). This is the background.\n2.  **Fill Color:** The color `8` (teal) appears exactly once at `(0, 29)`. This is the fill color.\n3.  **Activator:** The color `1` (blue).\n4.  **Target Shapes:** The shapes are primarily formed by `9` (maroon). There are also `3`s, but `3`s are adjacent to the seed `8` and do not appear to be the targets themselves based on the geometry (loops are made of `9`).\n5.  **Evaluating Shapes:**\n    *   **Top Left Loop (Rows 2-5):** A rectangular loop of `9`s.\n        *   It is touched by `1`s at `(2,3)` and `(2,6)`.\n        *   It encloses a region of `5`s: `(3,4), (3,5)` and `(4,4), (4,5)`.\n        *   **Action:** Fill these 4 pixels with `8`.\n    *   **Top Right Loop (Rows 2-5):** A larger rectangular loop of `9`s.\n        *   It is touched by `1`s along the top row (Row 2).\n        *   It encloses a region of `5`s: Rows 3-4, Columns 13-19.\n        *   **Action:** Fill these 14 pixels with `8`.\n    *   **Middle/Bottom Loops:**\n        *   There is a loop of `9`s on the left (Rows 10-13). It touches `3`s but *no* `1`s. **No Action.**\n        *   There is a vertical pipe of `9`s (Rows 11-21) and a structure on the bottom left. These touch `3`s but *no* `1`s. **No Action.**\n        *   There is a structure on the bottom right (Rows 22-27). It is touched by `1`s. However, analysis shows it is an \"open cup\" shape (open at the top towards the background `5`s) and not a closed loop. **No Action.**\n\n**Final Step:**\nApply the fill color `8` to the specific coordinates inside the Top Left and Top Right loops.\n\nOutput Grid Generation:\n- Start with input grid.\n- Set `(3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5)` to `8`.\n- Set `(3,13)` through `(3,19)` to `8`.\n- Set `(4,13)` through `(4,19)` to `8`.\n\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",

For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, here's my understanding of the task and how I'm going to approach it.**\n\nI'm being asked to solve an ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) puzzle. The user has given me three example inputs and outputs, and I need to figure out the rule and apply it to a test input.  My primary goal is to produce the final output grid, but I'm also required to explain my reasoning, *even though* the instructions initially seemed to want only the output grid.\n\n**Here's my thought process:**\n\n1.  **Rule Identification:**\n    *   I'll start by carefully examining the examples, looking for patterns and changes between the inputs and outputs.\n    *   I'll be mindful of any unusual instructions (like the \"CoT\" prompt) and follow them accurately. The CoT prompt wants a high-level summary of my thought process.\n    *   I'll develop a hypothesis about the rule, and refine it through iterations of analyzing the examples.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis and Refinement:**\n    *   Initially, I suspected the rule involved filling specific shapes.\n    *   I noticed the presence of \"markers\" in the input (single instances of a color) and how these related to the fill color.  My working theory became: find a unique color (the marker), identify closed rectangular loops, and fill the loops with a new color. I then refined that to be loops of a color that wasn't the \"neighbor\" of the unique marker.\n    *   I found the \"key\" or \"marker\" color (the one that appears only once or very few times) seemed to determine the fill color.\n\n3.  **Application to the Test Input:**\n    *   I'll analyze the test input, carefully counting colors to identify the markers.\n    *   I'll look for shapes within the input that fit my hypothesized rule - loops of colors except the color next to the unique marker pixel.\n    *   I determined there are two unique singletons (markers) which means there are two active fill operations happening at the same time. These two operations seem to have spatial dependencies based on whether the shape being filled is on the left side or the right side, with a 6 on the left, and an 8 on the right.\n\n4.  **Edge Cases and Validation:**\n    *   I'll think about possible edge cases:\n        *   Are the loops always rectangular? Yes, seems that way.\n        *   Does the boundary of the loop have to be a specific thickness?  Looks like only 1-thick boundaries are filled.\n        *   What if the loop is broken or incomplete? In those cases, it's not a valid loop and therefore, won't be filled.\n        *   This helps make sure I can rule out spurious interpretations.\n    *   I'll revisit the example inputs to confirm that my refined rule explains all the changes.\n\n5.  **Output and Explanation:**\n    *   I'll create the output grid by applying my rule.\n    *   I'll provide a clear, concise explanation of my reasoning, highlighting the key steps and the logic I followed.  The output will be the grid, along with the explanation to fully satisfy the user's instructions.\n    *   I had an idea that was \"Fill all enclosed shapes of X color with 7\". However, the fill color changed. And this required careful review.\n    *   I had to look for a special \"marker\" color. 6 and 8.\n    *   Then look for the neighbors 1 and 3. Then rule out filling shapes of 1 or 3.\n    *   I must carefully describe the steps and what shapes (9 loops) are filled.\n    *   After the rule is decided, I will state clearly the output grid.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, I will apply a hierarchical analysis of the objects, background, and transformation rules derived from the solved examples.\n\n### Analysis of Solved Examples\n\n1.  **Background & Objects**: The grids primarily consist of a background color (0 in examples, 5 in test) and foreground structures formed by various colors.\n2.  **Transformation Rule**:\n    *   **Markers**: In each example, there is a specific pixel (or \"marker\") that determines the **fill color**.\n        *   In Example 1, a `7` appears next to a `1`. The fill color becomes `7`.\n        *   In Example 2, a `4` appears next to a `1`. The fill color becomes `4`.\n        *   In Example 4, a `4` appears next to a `1`. The fill color becomes `4`.\n    *   **Targets**: The transformation fills the **interior** of closed, rectangular (or 8-connected) loops formed by other colors.\n    *   **Exclusion**: The color of the *neighbor* of the marker is \"protected\".\n        *   In Ex 1, `1` is the neighbor, and `1`-structures are not filled (while `2`, `3`, `5` loops are).\n        *   In Ex 2, `1` is the neighbor, and `1`-structures are not filled (while `2` loops are).\n    *   **Logic**: Identify the unique marker pixel(s). Determine the neighbor color. Locate all closed loops formed by colors *other than* the neighbor color. Fill the interior of these loops with the marker color.\n\n### Application to Test Input\n\n1.  **Identify Background**: The dominant background color is `5` (Grey).\n2.  **Identify Markers**:\n    *   Scanning the grid reveals two unique singleton pixels on the top row:\n        *   A `6` (Magenta) at `(0, 0)`.\n        *   An `8` (Teal) at `(0, 29)`.\n3.  **Identify Neighbors & Protections**:\n    *   The `6` is adjacent to a `1` (Blue). Rule: **Do not fill `1`-loops.**\n    *   The `8` is adjacent to a `3` (Green). Rule: **Do not fill `3`-loops.**\n4.  **Identify Targets**: We must look for closed loops formed by the remaining color, `9` (Maroon), enclosing the background `5`.\n5.  **Spatial Assignment**: Since there are two markers, I will apply a spatial heuristic: loops in the left half of the grid (closer to `6`) are filled with `6`, and loops in the right half (closer to `8`) are filled with `8`.\n\n**Detected Loops and Fills:**\n\n*   **Loop 1 (Top-Left)**: A diamond-like shape of `9`s spanning rows 2-5 and columns 3-6.\n    *   **Fill**: `6` (Magenta).\n    *   **Interior**: `(3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5)`.\n*   **Loop 2 (Mid-Left)**: A hexagonal shape of `9`s spanning rows 10-13 and columns 3-11.\n    *   **Fill**: `6` (Magenta).\n    *   **Interior**: Columns 4-10 in rows 11 and 12.\n*   **Loop 3 (Mid-Right)**: A vertical tube of `9`s spanning rows 12-21 at columns 15-17.\n    *   **Fill**: `8` (Teal) (Center is col 16, which is > 14).\n    *   **Interior**: Column 16 in rows 13-20.\n*   **Loop 4 (Bottom-Right)**: An irregular shape of `9`s spanning rows 22-28 at columns 15-22.\n    *   **Fill**: `8` (Teal).\n    *   **Interior**:\n        *   Row 23: Cols 20-21.\n        *   Row 24: Cols 19-21.\n        *   Row 25: Cols 18-20.\n        *   Row 26: Cols 17-19.\n        *   Row 27: Cols 16-18.\n\nAll other regions (including `1` and `3` shapes, and open structures) remain unchanged.\n\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'm approaching this ARC task:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics:** The challenge is to take a grid-based input, perform a transformation, and produce a new grid as output. The grids use integers to represent colors, with '0' often being the background. Shapes are made by lines (single-pixel-wide paths) and loops (closed paths).\n\n2.  **Key Transformation: Flood Fill:** The primary action seems to be \"flood filling.\" This means coloring the inside of a closed shape. But not all shapes get filled, so there must be a specific set of criteria that needs to be satisfied for filling to occur.\n\n3.  **Identify Markers:** To find out which closed regions to fill, I'm looking for \"markers\" or \"paint buckets\". These seem to be certain single-color pixels that act as the source of the flood. They're connected to the rest of the grid either directly or indirectly. The goal is to figure out the exact criteria for identifying a valid marker/paint source in the input.\n\n4.  **Connect the Dots:** Lines play a crucial role in \"connecting\" a marker to a set of loops. A loop becomes filled with a new color if the marker (color C) is a valid marker and there's a continuous line (color 1) or loop border (color X) path from the marker to the loop. Think of the marker as a bucket of paint that gets carried along a pathway and dumps its color into every closed container.\n\n5.  **Examine Patterns:** Examining the example grids helps establish the rules. For example, the examples confirm that the color to fill the inside of the loop is the color of the paint bucket and that a valid marker can be at the end of a blue line, or inside a loop.\n\n6.  **Apply to New Input:** Now, I'm taking the learned rules and applying them to the current test case. I will be identifying the marker (paint source), which is either attached to or inside a loop, trace the connections between the marker and other loops through lines or other loop borders, and apply the fill rules to generate a valid output. I will also be looking for cases where this doesn't occur and what the rules are for excluding certain loops.\n\nLet's do this!\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples and the test input, the transformation rules are as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Components**: The grid consists of a background color (usually 0, but **5** in the test input), \"lines\" (1, 3, etc.), \"loops\" formed by border colors (usually 9 in the test input), and \"markers\" (single pixels or blocks of a unique color attached to lines or loops).\n\n2.  **Locate Markers**: Find the source colors. In the test input:\n    *   **Magenta (6)** at (0,0).\n    *   **Teal (8)** at (0,29).\n    *   **Black (0)** at (14,1) and (18,2).\n\n3.  **Trace Connected Systems**:\n    *   **Magenta (6) System**: The marker connects to a Blue (1) line. This line traverses the grid and connects to several Maroon (9) loops. All loops connected to this line should be filled with **6**.\n        *   **Loop 1 (Top Left)**: Rectangular loop. Interior: Rows 3-4, Cols 4-5.\n        *   **Loop 2 (Top Right)**: Rectangular loop. Interior: Rows 3-4, Cols 14-19.\n        *   **Loop 4 (Bottom Right)**: Slanted loop. Interior: Row 23 (20-21), Row 24 (19-21), Row 25 (18-20), Row 26 (17-19), Row 27 (16-18).\n\n    *   **Teal (8) System**: The marker connects to a Green (3) line/structure. This connects to two Maroon (9) loops. These loops should be filled with **8**.\n        *   **Loop 7 (Middle Right Small)**: Rectangular. Interior: Rows 10-11, Cols 22-23.\n        *   **Loop 5 (Middle Vertical)**: A tall, thin loop.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the input/output pairs, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Structure identification**: Each grid contains hollow rectangles made of colored boundaries (2s, 3s, 5s, or 9s in the test), paths (1s typically, or 3s), and marker colors at the ends of paths.\n\n2. **The transformation rule**: \n   - Find paths (lines of 1s or 3s) that end at a special \"fill color\" marker\n   - Identify hollow rectangles that connect to these paths (where the path touches the corner of a rectangle)\n   - Fill the interior of connected rectangles with the marker color\n\n3. **In the test input**:\n   - There's a 1-path starting from top-left, with marker **6** at position (0,0)\n   - There's a 3-path starting from top-right, with marker **8** at position (0,29)\n   - Hollow rectangles made of 9s need to be filled based on which path they connect to\n\n**Rectangles to fill with 6 (connected to 1-path):**\n- Rows 3-4, cols 4-5 (small rectangle at top-left)\n- Rows 3-4, cols 13-19 (larger rectangle at top-middle)\n\n**Rectangles to fill with 8 (connected to 3-path):**\n- Rows 10-11, cols 22-23 (rectangle at middle-right)\n- Rows 11-12, cols 4-10 (large rectangle at middle-left)\n- Rows 23-24, cols 4-5 (rectangle at bottom-left)\n\n```\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,8,8,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into a Complex ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where the goal is to transform grids based on patterns, and I'm using solved examples to deduce the rules. The core seems to be about identifying and filling enclosed regions within these grids. My initial analysis focused on the visual structures\u2014different colored paths, loops, and \"holes\" that the paths form. I'm focusing on why certain loops are filled and others aren't.\n\nIt looks like I'm dealing with a \"flood-fill\" operation, but with some clever constraints.  The key observation is that filling happens only in loops that are somehow \"connected\" to a specific pixel (the \"marker\") and the \"path\" that's a key to the puzzle. I initially thought it was about distance from a marker.\n\nI started to focus on \"composite boundaries.\" My thought process was, \"Is it the path that closes the loop?\" So, if the loop is made from a certain color, and the path somehow connects to that loop and closes it, then the loop gets filled with the 'marker' color.\n\nBut then I realized it's not simply the path touching the loops, it's about the path's *interaction* with the loop. So, I saw the need to refine this to figure out how it functions. I thought the `7` marker acts as a paint bucket and it pours the color through the line.\n\nMy hypothesis kept refining, and I considered, \"What if filling the loop happens only when the loop's boundary is made of more than one color?\" This \"Heterogeneous Loop\" idea, where the loop's boundary is formed by a path and another color, or maybe the boundaries should contain more than two colors. This seemed to explain most of the cases.\n\nHowever, further analysis, especially with Example 3, challenged the \"composite boundary\" rule. It appeared that the fill was *influenced* by the marker but not necessarily bound to the path. The \"wall\" was green, and the path's colors linked with other colors. This led me to suspect it's based on some form of graph connectivity.\n\nMy new hypothesis, and this is where I'm at now, is that it's a fill operation, starting from a marker. It spreads through a connected network of colors. If a region is fully enclosed, and is \"active\" from the marker network, it fills with a specific marker's color.\n\nThe goal is to determine the fill color. The color of the mark is what needs to be filled.  This means that the fill isn't always bound by specific colors in the boundary of the loop.\n\nSo the algorithm is to look at the regions. Then you look at the neighbors (other color cells) and then fill it with the marker. Then the specific colors are checked for connectivity with the 'marker' pixel.\n\nSo, in the test, for a loop, I look at the color of each wall. If there's a 1 in there, that's attached to marker 6, then fill with 6.\n\nThis is where I'm headed. \n\n\nTo solve this task, I analyzed the provided examples and the test input to deduce the transformation rules.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n1.  **Background & Structure:** The grid consists of a background color (usually `0`, but `5` in the test input) and \"structures\" formed by lines of other colors (`1`, `2`, `3`, `9`, etc.).\n2.  **Markers:** There are specific single-pixel \"Markers\" of unique colors at the endpoints of some paths.\n    *   Example 1: Marker `7` (Orange) connected to path `1` (Blue).\n    *   Example 2, 3, 4: Marker `4` (Yellow) connected to path `1` (Blue).\n    *   Test Input: Marker `6` (Magenta) at (0,0) connected to path `1`. Marker `8` (Teal) at (0,29) connected to path `3`.\n3.  **Transformation:** The goal is to **fill closed loops** with the color of the Marker connected to the structure forming the loop.\n    *   Identify closed regions of the background color (`5` or `0`).\n    *   Check the boundary of each region.\n    *   If the boundary touches or consists of a network connected to Marker A, fill the region with Marker A's color.\n    *   In the Test Input:\n        *   Loops touching the **Blue (`1`) / Maroon (`9`)** network (connected to Marker `6`) are filled with **Magenta (`6`)**.\n        *   Loops touching the **Green (`3`)** network (connected to Marker `8`) are filled with **Teal (`8`)**.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Background:** The grid is filled with `5`s. There are loop structures enclosing regions of `5`s.\n2.  **Network 1 (Magenta `6`):** Starts at (0,0). Connects to Blue `1`. Blue `1` connects to Maroon `9`.\n    *   **Loop A:** Located at Rows 3-4, Cols 4-5. Enclosed by `9`s. Touches `1` at the corners.\n        *   **Action:** Fill with **`6`**.\n    *   **Loop C:** Located at Rows 3-4, Cols 13-19. Enclosed by `9`s. Touches `1` at the bottom-right corner.\n        *   **Action:** Fill with **`6`**.\n3.  **Network 2 (Teal `8`):** Starts at (0,29). Connects to Green `3`.\n    *   **Loop D:** Located at Rows 12-13, Cols 16-18. Enclosed by `9`s. Touches `3` at the top boundary (Row 11).\n        *   **Action:** Fill with **`8`**.\n    *   **Tiny Holes:** There are single `0` pixels at (14,1) and (18,2). Both are adjacent to Green `3`.\n        *   **Action:** Fill with **`8`**.\n\n**Coordinates to Fill:**\n*   **Fill with 6:**\n    *   R3: C4-5, C13-19\n    *   R4: C4-5, C13-19\n*   **Fill with 8:**\n    *   R12: C16-18\n    *   R13: C16-18\n    *   (14,1) and (18,2)\n\n```json\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,8,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n```",

There are one or more **\u201cpaint\u201d (fill) colors** present as *single isolated pixels* (they appear only once).  \n   - Example outputs show that these single pixels are the colors used to fill holes.\n   - In the test input there are two such single pixels: `6` (top-left corner) and `8` (top-right corner).\n\n3. Each paint pixel is placed **next to a \u201cconnector/path\u201d color** (a non-background neighbor).  \n   This tells which group of frames/holes should be filled with that paint color:\n   - In the test:  \n     - `6` touches color `1`  \u2192 holes whose frames connect to `1` are filled with `6`  \n     - `8` touches color `3`  \u2192 holes whose frames connect to `3` are filled with `8`\n\n4. The grids contain **frames (closed outlines)** made of a non-background color (here, mainly `9`).  \n   Inside these outlines are **enclosed background regions** (connected components of `5`) that do **not** connect to the outer background because they are blocked by the outline.\n\n5. **Fill rule:** For each enclosed background region (hole):\n   - Identify which connector/path color (`1` or `3`) touches the outline around that hole.\n   - Replace every background cell (`5`) in that enclosed region with the corresponding paint color (`6` for connector `1`, `8` for connector `3`).\n   - Do **not** overwrite non-background cells.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,8,8,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",

fill.\n* The blue path/network is preserved; the main action is **hole filling**, not moving objects.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Solving an ARC Problem: A Deep Dive into Frame Identification and Filling**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to tackle an ARC problem, and it looks like I've got to find a pattern involving \"frames\" and filling them. I've got examples and a test input to work with, so let's get started.\n\nFirst, I analyze the input-output pairs. I see a bunch of 1s (blue), which I'm calling a \"network,\" and frames of various colors. I noticed hollow shapes with interior cavities, which can be filled with a specific color.\n\nI'm starting to zero in on these \"frames.\" They seem to be hollow rectangles or squares, often with an outer dimension of roughly 4x4. The inner cavity appears to be 2x2. The key seems to be identifying these structures and figuring out when they get filled and with what color.\n\nThe hint about \"1-cell cavities\" is a bit confusing. My first thought is that the hint is describing the frame wall thickness or the hole's size (1). The hint says the fill color is derived from a \"singleton.\" The examples reveal the \"fill\" color matches a unique pixel within the input grid, a \"marker\" color.\n\nThrough the examples, I see a pattern: the fill color is determined by a unique pixel within the input and gets placed within a cavity formed by a frame. The frames are roughly square or rectangular with an outer border. The key appears to be a link to a \"network.\"\n\nOne example showed a frame being connected to the blue network of 1s. This leads me to believe the frames are \"powered\" by these networks, acting as supply lines to fill a frame.\n\nHowever, after further investigation, the \"network\" connection isn't always essential. Sometimes a frame is filled even without any direct network connection. This challenges my hypothesis.\n\nThe \"1-cell cavity\" hint remains unclear. Maybe it refers to the 2x2 shape in the middle, or the 1-pixel-thick border?\n\nTo test this, I jump into a test input. I look for singletons, or marker colors. It looks like the test input is designed to create confusion, as there are two singletons. It seems the background is also 5, so a \"hole\" is made of 5.\n\nI look for frames formed of a separate color enclosing a group of 5s.\n\nUsing the Test Input, I finally arrive at an actionable algorithm:\n\n1.  **Find the unique marker (the singletons).**  These define the color that will \"fill\" the frames (6 and 8).\n2.  **Identify the \"frames\".**  I'm looking for rectangular or square shapes in the test input, specifically ones which enclose a 2x2 block of 5s.\n3.  **Frame Fill:** The specific frame touching the \"blue\" network is filled by the \"6\" color, and the frame touching the \"green\" network is filled by the \"8\" color.\n\nNow, all that's left is to identify the frames and plug in the numbers. I can now convert this into a program.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we need to fill \"cavities\" inside \"frames\" based on specific rules derived from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Frames:** The objects being modified are hollow square/rectangular frames. In the examples, the frames that get filled are consistently **4x4** in outer size with a **2x2** interior cavity of 0s (background).\n2.  **Cavities:** The hint mentions \"1-cell cavities\". Given the 2x2 filling observed in all examples, this likely refers to the \"wall thickness\" being 1 cell, or it's a specific terminology for these small isolated holes.\n3.  **Filling Rule:** The interior of the frame is filled with a specific color.\n4.  **Color Source:** The fill color matches a **singleton/marker** pixel found elsewhere in the grid.\n5.  **Connectivity/Selection:**\n    *   In Example 1, the marker is **7** (orange). Frames of various colors (gray, green) are filled with 7. Crucially, a red frame at the top-left is *not* filled. This red frame touches a blue (1) line that is isolated from the main blue network. The filled frames touch the main blue network (or are part of a connected component).\n    *   In Example 3, frames are filled with **4** (yellow). The marker 4 is embedded in green (3) pixels. The frames that get filled are touching or embedded in the green/blue structures.\n    *   Hypothesis: There are \"networks\" defined by specific colors (e.g., blue lines, green blobs). A marker (singleton) attached to a network determines the \"fill color\" carried by that network. Any hollow frame touching that network gets filled with that color.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Markers:**\n    *   Scanning the input, we find two singletons:\n        *   **6** (magenta) at `(0,0)`.\n        *   **8** (teal) at `(0,29)`.\n2.  **Identify Networks:**\n    *   The marker **6** is adjacent to a **1** (blue) at `(0,1)`. This suggests the **Blue (1) network** carries the fill color **6**.\n    *   The marker **8** is adjacent to a **3** (green) at `(0,28)`. This suggests the **Green (3) network** carries the fill color **8**.\n3.  **Identify Frames and Fill:**\n    *   **Frame 1 (Top Left):** Located at rows 2-5, columns 3-6. It is a frame of **9**s enclosing a 2x2 area of **5**s (background) at `(3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5)`.\n        *   Connectivity: The top of this frame (row 2) touches blue **1** pixels at `(2,3)` and `(2,6)`.\n        *   Action: Since it touches the Blue network, we fill its interior with **6**.\n    *   **Frame 2 (Bottom Left):** Located at rows 23-26, columns 3-6. It is a frame of **9**s enclosing a 2x2 area of **5**s at `(24,4), (24,5), (25,4), (25,5)`.\n        *   Connectivity: The top of this frame (row 23) touches green **3** pixels at `(23,3)` and `(23,6)`.\n        *   Action: Since it touches the Green network, we fill its interior with **8**.\n\n**Execution:**\n*   Change cells `(3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5)` to **6**.\n*   Change cells `(24,4), (24,5), (25,4), (25,5)` to **8**.\n*   All other cells remain unchanged.\n\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",

fill.\n* The blue path/network is preserved; the main action is **hole filling**, not moving objects.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Initial Thoughts on this ARC task**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at an ARC task here, and it seems pretty straightforward: a grid of numbers, and I need to transform it based on some examples.  I immediately start breaking down the problem.  The key seems to be identifying patterns and then applying them. I see \"Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus\" (ARC), and right away I know I'm dealing with abstract spatial reasoning. I'm provided input and output grids and given a few hints to try and help.\n\n**Let's Dig into the Examples**\n\nI'm told there's a new color being added inside certain \"frames\" and I want to figure out what that means. The hint tells me about \"1-cell cavities\". I start analyzing the grid. Right away, I see this big structure made out of 2's, which are probably the frames. I trace the frame. It has a big hole in the middle, but it doesn't change. I go to the next grid and a 2x2 section of 0s turns to 7.  The problem is the 2x2 section of 0s in the earlier frame did *not* change. I start to wonder why. It seems as if I need to figure out what makes one change, but not another. I get a clue as I see a 7 at the bottom and begin to wonder if that makes the difference. I see that the same structure as the frame, but the hole is now changing. This makes me ask *why?* I check and there's a 7 at (17,23), maybe that is the secret.  I start to count how many of each number is in the grid.\n\n**I See Patterns Forming!**\n\nThen it hits me! I notice there's a \"network\". I start to examine this \"blue path\" which seems to snake across the grid. Now I'm re-reading the hints. I realize the numbers indicate the \"network\". Then I start mapping out what happens if the network touches what is in the frame. If the frame has a \"1-cell cavity\", it gets filled with the singleton color. Is there a marker color associated? I keep checking the clues. I start to notice it's only connected cells that seem to be filled.  I realize I need to find the specific rule to map frames and networks. I look at each example and attempt to recreate a rule that works. In the second example, I see the 4 is in the center, and so the holes of the frame are filled with the 4s. Is this true in every case?\n\n**Refining My Approach**\n\nNow I have a hypothesis:  if the frame is near the marker AND if the marker has some \"conductivity\", then the color is added in the cavity of the frame.  I try to break down the connectivity of \"blue\" path. What's the best way to get this right?\n\n**Solving The Big Picture**\n\nThe network may be a crucial element here.  The \"Blue path/network\" has to be the key. What is that? I check connectivity of 1s and other numbers in grids.  \"Flood fill\". I think of connected components. Now, I try to identify the marker again.  This process helped me realize that a number will only change if it is \"connected\" to the mark. I realize the markers are singletons, which are connected to a path. I use this knowledge and build this new rule. It is a bit complex, but I believe it is close! I can almost taste victory! Now that I know, I can see how the new color is added to the grid.  I go through all of the examples one last time.  I start to test the new rules against all the examples. I'm almost there.  With all the clues, and examples, I believe I have the right \"formula.\" Now to code and see if my new rules work!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify \"small square frames\" (hollow rings) in the grid and fill their \"1-cell cavities\" (interior holes) with a specific color. Based on the examples and hints, the logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Marker and Network:**\n    *   Find the singleton \"marker\" colors. In the test input, we have `6` at (0,0) and `8` at (0,29).\n    *   Identify the \"blue path/network\" (cells with color `1`).\n    *   The Marker `6` is directly adjacent to the network of `1`s (at 0,1). The Marker `8` is connected to the network via a chain of `3`s (which seem to act as connectors in ARC tasks of this type).\n    *   However, the fill color corresponds to the \"source\" marker. In the examples, the fill color matches the singleton marker. Here, `6` is at the start (0,0) and directly touches the `1`-path, making it the primary marker. Thus, the fill color is **6**.\n\n2.  **Identify Connected Frames:**\n    *   The \"network\" extends from the marker through `1`s and adjacent conductive colors (like `3`s, `9`s).\n    *   We need to find \"frames\" (closed loops of color `9` in the test input) that are **connected** to this network.\n    *   **Top Left Frame:** Located at Rows 2-5, Columns 3-6. It is a ring of `9`s. It touches the `1` network at (2,3). This frame is connected.\n    *   **Top Right Frame:** Located at Rows 2-5, Columns 12-20. It is a ring of `9`s. It touches the `1` network at (2,12). This frame is connected.\n    *   **Bottom Left Frame:** Located at Rows 10-13. It is separated from the top frames by rows of background `5`s and does not connect to the `1`s or `3`s network. It is disconnected.\n    *   **Other Structures:** There is a \"needle\" shape in the middle and a \"snake\" shape at the bottom right. The needle is disconnected. The snake is connected but is not a \"small square frame\".\n\n3.  **Fill the Holes:**\n    *   The \"holes\" (cavities) inside the connected frames are filled with the marker color `6`.\n    *   **Top Left Frame Hole:** The interior is at **Rows 3-4, Columns 4-5**. These `5`s become `6`s.\n    *   **Top Right Frame Hole:** The interior is at **Rows 3-4, Columns 13-19**. These `5`s become `6`s.\n\n**Resulting Transformation:**\nCopy the input grid, but change the specific cells inside the two top frames to `6`.\n\n**Input Grid Segment (Rows 3-4):**\n`...9,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9...`\n**Output Grid Segment (Rows 3-4):**\n`...9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9...`\n\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs add a new color only inside the **1-cell cavities** of small square \u201cframes\u201d (hollow rings).\n* The fill color matches a **pre-existing singleton/marker** color in the input (e.g., yellow/orange) and that marker stays.\n* Frame border color doesn\u2019t matter: multiple frame colors can get the **same** interior fill.\n* The blue path/network is preserved; the main action is **hole filling**, not moving objects.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs add a new color only inside the **1-cell cavities** of small square \u201cframes\u201d (hollow rings).\n* The fill color matches a **pre-existing singleton/marker** color in the input (e.g., yellow/orange) and that marker stays.\n* Frame border color doesn\u2019t matter: multiple frame colors can get the **same** interior fill.\n* The blue path/network is preserved; the main action is **hole filling**, not moving objects.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Do not change any border or the marker cell.\n\nIn the test grid, this frame pattern occurs three times (all with border color `9`), so three 2\u00d72 cavities are filled with `6`.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,6,6,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs add a new color only inside the **1-cell cavities** of small square \u201cframes\u201d (hollow rings).\n* The fill color matches a **pre-existing singleton/marker** color in the input (e.g., yellow/orange) and that marker stays.\n* Frame border color doesn\u2019t matter: multiple frame colors can get the **same** interior fill.\n* The blue path/network is preserved; the main action is **hole filling**, not moving objects.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "From the examples, the output is identical to the input except for **filling the \u201chole\u201d of certain small square frames**:\n\n### 1) Identify the fill (marker) color\nIn every example there is a **marker color** that already exists in the input (typically as a singleton), and the same color is used to fill the holes. The marker cell itself is not changed.\n\nIn the test grid, the only singleton color that is clearly a \u201cmarker\u201d (sitting next to the blue/1 network) is **6** at the top-left corner.  \nSo the **fill color = 6**.\n\n### 2) Identify which shapes are \u201cframes\u201d\nThe frames in the examples are **4\u00d74 hollow square frames** whose **interior is a 2\u00d72 cavity**.  \nA cavity is detected as a **2\u00d72 block of background** (here the background is 5) such that the **8 side cells around it** (two above, two below, two left, two right) are all the **same non-background color** (the frame border). The **corners of the 4\u00d74 are irrelevant** and may be anything.\n\n### 3) Apply to the test input\nScanning the test grid for that pattern gives three such frames (all with border color 9), with 2\u00d72 cavities at:\n- rows **4\u20135**, cols **5\u20136**\n- rows **11\u201312**, cols **23\u201324**\n- rows **24\u201325**, cols **5\u20136**\n\nFill those cavity cells with **6** and leave everything else unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,6,6,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",

Describe the observable structures**\n\nDescribe what you see **without guessing** the rule:\n\n* What objects exist? (shapes, colors, connected components)\n* How are they arranged? (locations, orientations, bounding boxes)\n* What changes from input to output? (additions, removals, movements)\n* What stays the same? (stable background, preserved shapes)\n\nBe very literal and avoid hypothesizing here.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\nFor each, say \u201cpresent\u201d, \u201cmaybe\u201d, or \u201cabsent\u201d:\n\n* **Object movement**\n* **Object recoloring**\n* **Bordering / outlining**\n* **Filling holes or cavities**\n* **Removing noise / extracting main shape**\n* **Copying / pasting / repositioning**\n* **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**\n* **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**\n* **Size-based filtering or selection**\n* **Symmetry or reflection operations**\n* **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**\n* **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**\n\nThis helps narrow down plausible rule families.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\nList 3\u20136 insights that are **crucial and not immediately obvious**.\nExamples of the kind of insights to extract:\n\n* \u201cOnly the *largest* blue cluster receives a border; smaller ones are ignored.\u201d\n* \u201cNew colors in the output correspond to *inside* regions of hollow shapes.\u201d\n* \u201cThe transformation only acts on objects touching the top edge.\u201d\n* \u201cThe rule depends on which color appears in the **top-left tile** of the input.\u201d\n* \u201cObjects are replaced with templated icons depending on their color.\u201d\n* \u201cInternal holes are treated as objects and recolored independently.\u201d\n\nFocus on the subtle but general behavior.\n\n---\n\n## **4.

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\n### Pair 1\n- **Input:** Mostly black background.  \n  - One long **blue** 1-cell-thick connected path, including a vertical segment along the **right edge**.  \n  - Several **red** \u201cframe-like\u201d clusters that look like small squares/rings (colored perimeter with a **single black cell in the middle**).  \n  - One similar **green** frame-like cluster near the middle.  \n  - One similar **gray** frame-like cluster near the top-right area.  \n  - A single **orange** cell near the bottom-right edge.\n- **Output:** Same background and same blue/red/green/gray shapes in the same places.  \n  - **New orange cells** appear exactly in the **central black cell** of multiple frame-like clusters (including red, green, and gray ones).  \n  - The original lone orange cell remains.\n\n### Pair 2\n- **Input:** Black background.  \n  - A connected **blue** 1-cell-thick wavy path across the grid.  \n  - Multiple **red** frame-like square/ring clusters (each with a **single black center cell**).  \n  - A single **yellow** cell near the bottom-left corner.\n- **Output:** Same blue path and red frames stay in place.  \n  - **Yellow cells** appear in the **center** of the red frame-like clusters.  \n  - The original yellow cell remains.\n\n### Pair 3\n- **Input:** Black background.  \n  - A connected **blue** path.  \n  - Several **red** frame-like clusters (perimeter with black center).  \n  - A **right-side vertical structure** that includes **green** and **red** cells (some parts also appear frame-like).  \n  - At least one **yellow** cell near the bottom area.\n- **Output:** Same objects remain in place.  \n  - **Additional yellow cells** appear in the **center positions** of multiple frame-like clusters.\n\n### Pair 4\n- **Input:** Small grid on black background.  \n  - A single **red** frame-like square/ring near the top-left with a **black center**.  \n  - A **blue** step-like path to the right/bottom.  \n  - A single **yellow** cell at the bottom-right.\n- **Output:** Same red and blue shapes remain.  \n  - The **center** of the red frame-like shape becomes **yellow** (the bottom-right yellow cell remains).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement:** absent  \n- **Object recoloring:** present (some black cells become a non-black color)  \n- **Bordering / outlining:** absent  \n- **Filling holes or cavities:** present  \n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** absent  \n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** maybe (a color is replicated to multiple locations, but objects aren\u2019t moved)  \n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center):** maybe (a lone colored \u201cmarker\u201d is on an edge/corner in several examples)  \n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** maybe (the fill color looks like the rare singleton color)  \n- **Size-based filtering or selection:** maybe (only specific 1-cell cavities get changed)  \n- **Symmetry or reflection operations:** absent  \n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** absent (except the \u201cfill\u201d of interior)  \n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** absent  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. The changed cells are **specifically the interior \u201chole\u201d cells** (the black center) of small frame-like clusters, not arbitrary black regions.\n2. The **same fill color** is applied to many holes, and that fill color matches an **already-present singleton color** in the input (yellow or orange).\n3. Frame-like clusters of **different border colors** (e.g., red, green, gray) can receive the **same interior fill**.\n4. The large **blue path/network stays unchanged** across all examples; it appears to be context/infrastructure rather than a target for recoloring.\n5. The singleton \u201cmarker\u201d color cell is **not removed**; it remains while its color is propagated into the holes.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nIdentify a \u201cpaint\u201d/marker color in the input (often a single isolated cell of a distinctive color). Then find all small hollow/frame-like objects (colored perimeter enclosing a black cavity) and **fill their enclosed black interior cell(s)** with that marker color, leaving all other pixels unchanged.  \n\nIf ambiguous: a close alternative is that only frame-like objects that are part of (or adjacent to) the main blue-connected structure are filled, but the dominant pattern is \u201cfill every enclosed 1-cell hole with the marker color.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks to perform when solving\n\n1. **Detect the marker color**: is it the rarest non-background color or a singleton pixel? Verify it equals the new fill color in the output.\n2. **Hole detection**: find black cells that are fully enclosed (not connected to the outside via 4-neighborhood), and check whether those are exactly the cells recolored.\n3. Confirm that **frame borders (red/green/gray)** and the **blue path** are unchanged.\n4. Test whether **only closed frames** get filled (any open/partial shapes should remain without interior fill).\n5. Ensure the **marker pixel remains** in the same location in the output.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* Outputs add a new color only inside the **1-cell cavities** of small square \u201cframes\u201d (hollow rings).\n* The fill color matches a **pre-existing singleton/marker** color in the input (e.g., yellow/orange) and that marker stays.\n* Frame border color doesn\u2019t matter: multiple frame colors can get the **same** interior fill.\n* The blue path/network is preserved; the main action is **hole filling**, not moving objects.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. **Backgrounds**: Uniform fields of color 0 or color 5.\n2. **Hollow Frames**: Rectangular borders made of color 2, 3, 5, or 9.\n3. **Solid Fills**: Rectangular blocks of color 4 or 7 situated inside the frames.\n4. **Linear Paths**: Meandering lines of color 1 or 3 acting as connectors or wires.\n5. **Terminals**: Single pixels of color 4, 7, or 8 located at the endpoints of linear paths.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nFind the unique terminal pixel (color 4/7/8) and let its color be T. Using 8-neighbor connectivity over all non-background pixels (background is 0 or 5), select only hollow rectangular frames (borders in 2/3/5/9) that are connected to the terminal\u2019s component. For each selected frame, recolor all background (0 or 5) cells inside the frame to T, leaving borders (2/3/5/9), paths (1/3), and the terminal pixel unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Solving the ARC Task: My Process**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC problem. First thing's first: understand the task. I see a grid of numbers 0-9, examples with inputs and outputs, and a bunch of text. My brain immediately jumps to \"Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus\" \u2013 that's the ARC challenge. The core task is to figure out the rule that transforms the input to the output.\n\nMy initial approach? Let's treat it like a puzzle. I'm going to look at those provided examples, especially those three solved input-output pairs. Then there is an unsolved test input grid that I need to solve, which means there must be a rule.\n\nThe text description has some clues! \"Objects Description\" and \"Transformation Description\" \u2013 those are huge hints. These are *key*. I'll need to figure out how that applies to each of the solved examples.\n\nI'm immediately checking the examples. I start by verifying if the provided descriptions actually hold true. The \"Objects Description\" lays out what the grid elements can be. Backgrounds (0 or 5), hollow rectangular frames (borders of 2, 3, 5, or 9), solid fills (blocks of 4 or 7), linear paths (1 or 3), and \"terminals\" (single pixels of 4, 7, or 8). I'm looking for patterns, making sure the description fits what I see.\n\nAfter verifying the Object Description, I try to follow the \"Transformation Description\". It basically tells me to find a terminal pixel, then look for connected components using 8-neighbor connectivity. Next, select those hollow rectangular frames attached to that terminal's component. Recolor the inner background to the terminal's color. Then, I am going to try and follow the steps on the provided example.\n\nI start walking through the examples, tracing the colors and how they transform. The terminal color. I figure out how \"connectivity\" works based on the description. I look at the color transformations. I carefully trace the connections.\n\nFor Example 1, I find it has a color 7 in the bottom-right corner. It's connected to a path of 1s, which seem to wind through the grid. These lines touch rectangular frames of 2s and some backgrounds of 5. The rule must be \"if a frame is connected, fill it.\"\n\nThis leads me to formulate the rule more precisely.\n1. Find the unique color (terminal). This becomes the \"fill color.\"\n2. Find the \"background\" (0 or 5).\n3. Find \"structural\" elements - paths, borders, and terminal.\n4. From the terminal, trace connected structural parts\n5.  Rectangular loops are important\n6. If the terminal touches the loops, the interior is the fill color.\n\nFor detecting those loops of color, the prompt is specific: they are rectangles made of 2, 3, 5, or 9. I now need to search for rectangles of those colors.\n\nSo, I\u2019m getting ready to apply this to the test input. It's 30x30, so I need to parse the grid and apply my logic.\n\nI go through the steps, first by finding that terminal element. Then checking for backgrounds. Then identifying the rectangles.\n\nI'm doing a lot of visual scanning and counting at this point. I'm carefully reading the given grid, trying to avoid any misreads or misinterpretations.\n\nI see those 9s. I see several rectangles. Are they connected? Using the descriptions, I identify those that are.\n\nI analyze the \"network\" of paths. My rule is about those connections. The 1s are connected to the rectangles. I see that the terminal is at the right edge, it seems.\n\nCarefully, I trace that network, which is very important. I scan the rows, and columns for those rectangles to see if they are part of a connected component. My rule is that all the rectangles attached to the network are supposed to be filled.\n\nSo, for the rectangles:\n*   I found the big 9s at (D).\n*   The smaller at (E)\n*   The bottom ones (G)\n*   And those near the center (H).\n*   There's also another Hex like structure at (I).\n\nI'm making a list of what pixels in each grid that will get the terminal number, 8. And I double-check to make sure those pixels are, in fact, those that I will replace with the right color.\n\nI recheck that the numbers are correct! I recheck one of the rows. I scan for the terminals. I scan to make sure that these numbers are consistent across the grid.\n\nAnd I am ready to summarize.\n\n**Explanation of Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Objects and Transformation Rule:**\n    Based on the provided examples and descriptions:\n    *   **Terminal:** Identify the unique pixel with a color in {4, 7, 8}. Let this color be $T$.\n    *   **Connectivity:** Determine the set of \"structural\" pixels connected to the Terminal. Structural pixels include borders (colors 2, 3, 5, 9), paths (colors 1, 3), and terminals. Background pixels are 0 and 5. Connectivity is defined by 8-neighbor adjacency.\n    *   **Target Frames:** Identify \"Hollow Rectangular Frames\" (closed loops of structural colors, approximating rectangles or octagons) that are part of the connected component of the Terminal.\n    *   **Action:** For every such connected frame, flood-fill its interior background pixels (0 or 5) with the terminal color $T$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Test Input:**\n    *   **Terminal:** Located at row 0, column 29 with color **8**. So, $T=8$.\n    *   **Background:** The grid contains 0s and 5s as background.\n    *   **Network/Connectivity Tracing:**\n        *   Starting at (0, 29) [Color 8], the path connects to a \"wire\" of 3s going down the right edge (cols 28-29).\n        *   This wire connects to a path of 1s at Row 6, which forms a vertical bus traveling down column 27 and branching left.\n        *   The network spreads throughout the grid via lines of 1s and 3s, connecting various structures made of 9s.\n\n3.  **Identify Connected Frames and Fill Regions:**\n    I identified the following hollow frames formed by color 9 that are connected to the network:\n\n    *   **Frame E (Top Left):** A small \"octagonal\" rectangle.\n        *   Bounds: Rows 2-5, Columns 3-6.\n        *   Interior: **Rows 3-4, Columns 4-5**. These are 5s (background).\n        *   Status: Connected to the 1-path at Row 2. **Fill with 8**.\n\n    *   **Frame D (Top Right):** A wide \"octagonal\" rectangle.\n        *   Bounds: Rows 2-5, Columns 12-20.\n        *   Interior: **Rows 3-4, Columns 13-19**. These are 5s.\n        *   Status: Connected to the 1-path at Row 2. **Fill with 8**.\n\n    *   **Frame I (Middle Right):** A hexagonal shape.\n        *   Bounds: Rows 9-12, Columns 21-24.\n        *   Interior: **Rows 10-11, Columns 22-23**. These are 5s.\n        *   Status: Connected via 3s in Row 11 to the central structure. **Fill with 8**.\n\n    *   **Frame A (Middle Left):** A wide \"octagonal\" rectangle.\n        *   Bounds: Rows 10-13, Columns 3-11.\n        *   Interior: **Rows 11-12, Columns 4-10**.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. **Backgrounds**: Uniform fields of color 0 or color 5.\n2. **Hollow Frames**: Rectangular borders made of color 2, 3, 5, or 9.\n3. **Solid Fills**: Rectangular blocks of color 4 or 7 situated inside the frames.\n4. **Linear Paths**: Meandering lines of color 1 or 3 acting as connectors or wires.\n5. **Terminals**: Single pixels of color 4, 7, or 8 located at the endpoints of linear paths.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nFind the unique terminal pixel (color 4/7/8) and let its color be T. Using 8-neighbor connectivity over all non-background pixels (background is 0 or 5), select only hollow rectangular frames (borders in 2/3/5/9) that are connected to the terminal\u2019s component. For each selected frame, recolor all background (0 or 5) cells inside the frame to T, leaving borders (2/3/5/9), paths (1/3), and the terminal pixel unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, here's my breakdown of how I'm approaching this ARC task.  It's a puzzle where I need to transform a grid of numbers based on some visual patterns.  I'm basically trying to understand the rules and apply them.\n\n**Key Task Elements**\n\n*   **Input:** A grid, just a bunch of numbers from 0 to 9.\n*   **Output:**  A modified grid, the same size, but with some numbers changed.\n*   **Objects to Identify:** There are a few key things I need to find:\n    *   **Background:** This is usually represented by the numbers 0 or 5.\n    *   **\"Hollow Frames\"**: These are rectangles made of specific numbers (2, 3, 5, or 9). They are like borders. And they can have \"cut corners\". They have empty space inside. The inner space will be the key.\n    *   **\"Terminals\"**: These are single pixels colored 4, 7, or 8 and are the endpoints of \"linear paths.\"\n    *   **\"Linear Paths\"**: Series of connected pixels, the pixel value is 1 or 3.\n\n**The Transformation**\n\n1.  **Find the Terminal:** I need to locate the single pixel (4, 7, or 8). Let's call its value *T*.\n2.  **Connectivity:** I need to find all the non-background pixels (everything except 0 and 5) that are connected to the terminal. I must follow the prompt's instructions:  use **8-neighbor connectivity**, so I can move diagonally.\n3.  **Frame Identification and Filling:** Look for all hollow rectangular frames in the grid, made up of specific numbers. Check if *any* part of the frame is connected to the terminal (via the path from step 2).  If a frame is connected, I fill its interior with the terminal color *T*. If not, the frame interior stays the same.\n\n**Test Case Analysis**\n\nThe task includes test cases.\n\n*   In Example 1, I noticed that the top-left frame, a cutout square, even though adjacent, was not filled. The connectivity should follow 8-way, so diagonals. The path and frame touched, but it was not filled, even with connectivity (diagonal) considered. The same shape appeared in Example 4.\n*   After careful thought, I decided on 8-connectivity. It appears the connection should extend to these diagonals.\n*   Now, I need to analyze a given Test Input with similar considerations.\n*   I will trace paths in the new Test Input and make a list of frames based on these rules.\n*   Then I will apply fill for all the \"valid\" frames.\n\n**Applying the Rules to the Test Input**\n\nI'll go through the Test Input and will find these:\n\n1.  **Terminal:**  Find the pixel with color 8.\n2.  **Path:** There's a path of numbers connecting to it. The number is 3.\n3.  **Hollow Rectangular Frames:** I will identify the frames.\n4.  **Connectivity & Fill:** I'll determine the frames that are connected to the terminal (following the 8-neighbor rule) and fill their interiors.\n\nI will then construct the final output based on these identified steps.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on connectivity to a \"terminal\" pixel.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   **Background:** Pixels with value 5 (and 0).\n    *   **Terminal:** The unique pixel with value 8 at row 0, column 29.\n    *   **Paths:** Wires of color 3 and color 1.\n    *   **Frames:** Rectangular (or octagon-shaped) borders made of color 9.\n\n2.  **Analyze Connectivity:**\n    *   The terminal (8) at (0,29) connects to a path of 3s.\n    *   Tracing the 3s, they connect to a path of 1s in the lower-middle section (around row 6/7). specifically, the 3s and 1s touch diagonally.\n    *   The path of 1s connects to a large frame structure of 9s in the middle top (Frame 2).\n    *   This frame of 9s connects via a path of 1s (row 2) to another frame of 9s on the left (Frame 1).\n    *   Therefore, both Frame 1 and Frame 2 are part of the connected component attached to the terminal.\n\n3.  **Identify Frames to Fill:**\n    *   **Frame 1 (Top Left):** Located approx at rows 2-5, columns 3-6.\n        *   Border is 9s.\n        *   Shape: Cut-corner rectangle (octagon).\n        *   Interior pixels are at Row 3 (Cols 4, 5) and Row 4 (Cols 4, 5).\n        *   These pixels are currently 5. They must be filled with the terminal color (8).\n    *   **Frame 2 (Top Middle):** Located approx at rows 2-5, columns 12-20.\n        *   Border is 9s.\n        *   Shape: Cut-corner rectangle.\n        *   Interior pixels are at Row 3 (Cols 13-19) and Row 4 (Cols 13-19).\n        *   These pixels are currently 5. They must be filled with 8.\n    *   **Other Structures:**\n        *   There are potential frames on the left (rows 10-14) and bottom-left (rows 23-25) and a vertical chute (rows 15-20).\n        *   Detailed inspection of the indices shows these structures are \"open\" (gaps in the border or open tops), so they do not qualify as hollow frames to be filled.\n\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   Change Row 3, Columns 4-5 from 5 to 8.\n    *   Change Row 3, Columns 13-19 from 5 to 8.\n    *   Change Row 4, Columns 4-5 from 5 to 8.\n    *   Change Row 4, Columns 13-19 from 5 to 8.\n    *   All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n\n*   Row 3 original: `5,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5`\n*   Row 3 new: `5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5`\n*   Row 4 original: `5,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5`\n*   Row 4 new: `5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5`\n\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",

let its color be T. Using 8-neighbor connectivity over all non-background pixels (background is 0 or 5), select only hollow rectangular frames (borders in 2/3/5/9) that are connected to the terminal\u2019s component. For each selected frame, recolor all background (0 or 5) cells inside the frame to T, leaving borders (2/3/5/9), paths (1/3), and the terminal pixel unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n\n1. **Find the terminal pixel**: Color 8 at position (0, 29)\n2. **Identify hollow rectangular frames** made of non-background pixels (9s in this case, with background being 5)\n3. **Trace connectivity** using 8-neighbor connectivity over all non-background pixels\n4. **Fill connected frames** with the terminal color (8)\n\n**Identifying frames:**\n- Frame 1: rows 3-4, cols 4-5 (bounded by 9s)\n- Frame 2: rows 3-4, cols 13-19 (bounded by 9s)  \n- Frame 3: rows 11-12, cols 4-10 (bounded by 9s)\n- Frame 4: rows 10-11, cols 22-23 (bounded by 9s)\n- Frame 5: rows 23-24, cols 4-5 (bounded by 9s)\n\n**Tracing connectivity from terminal (8):**\n- The 3-path from (0,28) connects down the right side to Frame 4 at (9,22-24)\n- The 1-path at rows 5-6 connects to the 3-path and leads to Frames 1 and 2\n- The 3-path continues via the vertical structure (cols 15-17) and connects to Frame 5 via the left-side 3-path (rows 20-22)\n- Frame 3 is isolated - the 3s at (13,2-3) connect only to Frame 3 but have no path to the terminal\n\n**Connected frames to fill: 1, 2, 4, 5** (not Frame 3)\n\n```\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,8,8,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. **Backgrounds**: Uniform fields of color 0 or color 5.\n2. **Hollow Frames**: Rectangular borders made of color 2, 3, 5, or 9.\n3. **Solid Fills**: Rectangular blocks of color 4 or 7 situated inside the frames.\n4. **Linear Paths**: Meandering lines of color 1 or 3 acting as connectors or wires.\n5. **Terminals**: Single pixels of color 4, 7, or 8 located at the endpoints of linear paths.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nFind the unique terminal pixel (color 4/7/8) and let its color be T. Using 8-neighbor connectivity over all non-background pixels (background is 0 or 5), select only hollow rectangular frames (borders in 2/3/5/9) that are connected to the terminal\u2019s component. For each selected frame, recolor all background (0 or 5) cells inside the frame to T, leaving borders (2/3/5/9), paths (1/3), and the terminal pixel unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The only \u201cterminal\u201d color (from {4,7,8}) in the test input is the **8** at the top-right corner, so the fill color **T = 8**. Treat **0 and 5 as background**, and all other colors as non-background.\n\nUsing **8-neighbor connectivity** on non-background cells, take the connected component that contains the terminal 8. Then find all **hollow rectangular frames** (the same \u201ccut-corner\u201d rectangle style as in the examples: top/bottom edges are inset by 1 cell so the corners are not part of the border) whose border pixels are in that terminal-connected component. For each such frame, recolor every **background (0 or 5)** cell strictly **inside** the frame to **8**, leaving all borders and wire/path pixels unchanged.\n\nIn this grid, the frames connected to the terminal are filled, producing 8s in these interiors (and leaving the disconnected frame unchanged).\n\nFinal output grid:\n```\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,8,8,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. **Backgrounds**: Uniform fields of color 0 or color 5.\n2. **Hollow Frames**: Rectangular borders made of color 2, 3, 5, or 9.\n3. **Solid Fills**: Rectangular blocks of color 4 or 7 situated inside the frames.\n4. **Linear Paths**: Meandering lines of color 1 or 3 acting as connectors or wires.\n5. **Terminals**: Single pixels of color 4, 7, or 8 located at the endpoints of linear paths.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nFind the unique terminal pixel (color 4/7/8) and let its color be T. Using 8-neighbor connectivity over all non-background pixels (background is 0 or 5), select only hollow rectangular frames (borders in 2/3/5/9) that are connected to the terminal\u2019s component. For each selected frame, recolor all background (0 or 5) cells inside the frame to T, leaving borders (2/3/5/9), paths (1/3), and the terminal pixel unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred rule (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Identify the terminal pixel**: find the single pixel colored **4, 7, or 8**. Its color is the fill color **T**.  \n   - In the test grid the only such pixel is **8** (top-right), so **T = 8**.\n\n2. **Define background vs foreground**: treat **0 and 5 as background**. Every other color is \u201cforeground\u201d.\n\n3. **Find what is \u201cconnected to the terminal\u201d**: using **8-neighbor connectivity** (including diagonals) over **foreground pixels only**, take the connected component that contains the terminal (8).\n\n4. **Select connected rectangular frames**: find hollow rectangular frames whose borders are made from frame-colors (here the borders are **9**). A frame is selected **only if its border touches the terminal\u2019s connected component**.\n\n5. **Fill selected frames**: for each selected frame, recolor every **background (0 or 5)** cell strictly **inside** the frame to **T** (=8). Do **not** change the border, wires/paths, or the terminal itself.\n\nIn this test grid, the frames connected to the terminal component are the ones whose interiors are at:\n- rows **4\u20135**, cols **5\u20136**\n- rows **4\u20135**, cols **14\u201320**\n- rows **11\u201312**, cols **23\u201324**\n- rows **24\u201325**, cols **5\u20136**\n\nThose interior background cells become **8**.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,8,8,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",

                "response": "**Analyzing Grid Object Types**\n\nOkay, so I need to describe the objects within these grids, focusing on their types and attributes, and no rules or relationships, got it. Let's see... I've got a series of grids here, and my job is to distill them into a single, general description. I'll need to look for recurring patterns. Alright, let's start scanning each grid, making notes... background seems to be color 0 most of the time, but one grid has a background of color 5. Interesting. I see rectangular shapes - hollow frames - made of color 2, sometimes 3, 5, or 9. They're often empty inside, but sometimes they're filled with a solid color, like 4 or 7. There are also lines, sometimes color 1, sometimes 3, that seem to connect these frames or just meander around. Hmm, and at the end of these lines, I often see a single pixel of a color, either a 4, a 7, or an 8. So, I need to group these elements.\n\nIt's pretty clear: there's a background (usually 0, sometimes 5), hollow rectangular frames (colors 2, 3, 5, 9), sometimes filled with solid blocks (colors 4, 7), lines (colors 1, 3) acting as connectors, and single-pixel terminals (colors 4, 7, 8) at the ends of the lines. It's like a set of components that are assembled a little differently each time, and I've got to find the overarching structure. These colors are important, let's write them down as a list.\n\nThe rectangular frames can be characterized by their border color and whether or not they're empty or filled. The lines are connectors. And the single pixels at the line ends are terminals, indicating specific states or \"endpoints\". The background is simply where everything rests. I've got this now. Based on this analysis I can create a concise description. I just need to make sure this generalized summary covers all the nuances.\n\n\nBased on the visual data provided in the grids, the objects can be categorized into the following types:\n\n**1. Background**\nThe canvas of the grids is composed of a uniform field of a single color. In the majority of the grids, the background is color 0. In one specific instance, the background is color 5. All other objects are superimposed onto this field.\n\n**2. Hollow Rectangular Frames**\nThese are rectangular or square shapes defined by a one-pixel-wide border.\n*   **Geometry:** They vary in size (e.g., 2x2, 3x3, or larger rectangular dimensions) but always form a closed loop.\n*   **Colors:** The borders are primarily formed using color 2, color 3, color 5, or color 9.\n*   **State:** These frames exist in two states:\n    1.  **Empty:** The interior pixels match the background color (0 or 5).\n    2.  **Filled:** The interior pixels are occupied by a solid block of a different color (specifically color 4 or color 7).\n\n**3. Linear Paths (Connectors)**\nThese are contiguous lines of pixels that meander through the grid, often connecting different frames or originating from them.\n*   **Geometry:** They are usually 1 pixel wide and move orthogonally (horizontal and vertical steps), though they occasionally form diagonals or clusters. They resemble wires or pipes.\n*   **Colors:** These paths are predominantly made of color 1.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. **Backgrounds**: Uniform fields of color 0 or color 5.\n2. **Hollow Frames**: Rectangular borders made of color 2, 3, 5, or 9.\n3. **Solid Fills**: Rectangular blocks of color 4 or 7 situated inside the frames.\n4. **Linear Paths**: Meandering lines of color 1 or 3 acting as connectors or wires.\n5. **Terminals**: Single pixels of color 4, 7, or 8 located at the endpoints of linear paths.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nFind the unique terminal pixel (color 4/7/8) and let its color be T. Using 8-neighbor connectivity over all non-background pixels (background is 0 or 5), select only hollow rectangular frames (borders in 2/3/5/9) that are connected to the terminal\u2019s component. For each selected frame, recolor all background (0 or 5) cells inside the frame to T, leaving borders (2/3/5/9), paths (1/3), and the terminal pixel unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
