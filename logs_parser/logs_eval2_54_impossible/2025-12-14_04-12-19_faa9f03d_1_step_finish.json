I'm presented with several solved examples and one test case. The input always includes grids with colored lines, horizontal and vertical, with varying degrees of complexity, including intersections and gaps. The output is a modified grid, and I need to deduce the transformation rules. My initial instinct is to analyze the examples systematically, noting the changes to the lines, especially at intersection points. I need to look for patterns in how colors interact and how lines are modified. The test input will be used to validate my hypothesis.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis: Decoding Line Transformations**\n\nIn Example 1, the core seems to involve \"lines,\" defined as sequences of pixels with the same color. There are horizontal and vertical lines of different colors, and intersections, too. In the output grid, lines appear to be *completed* or *extended*. For instance, the vertical \"blue\" line is extended, and its color appears to \"overwrite\" the horizontal \"green\" line at their intersection. My immediate thought is, are there dominance rules? Maybe one color \"wins\" at an intersection. Also, are endpoint colors important? The red endpoints of the horizontal green line become green in the output. This suggests that the endpoints change to match the line color.\n\n**Refining Line Definition and Intersection Dominance**\n\nI'm now thinking I need to be more precise about what constitutes a \"line.\" It's a continuous run of identical non-black pixels, possibly with caps or other color intersections. I'm focusing on two key elements: \"filling gaps\" and \"line extensions\". I also need to figure out how to handle \"cap\" colors. Are they always endpoints? Or can they indicate directions?\n\nExample 2 is interesting. Here, a yellow pixel \"intrudes\" into a green horizontal line. The line seems to shift in the output, and the Yellow pixel somehow defines the output. I also notice that the line color at intersections is not always consistent - which color \"wins\"?\n\nI hypothesize that the intersection outcomes are determined by a \"Dominance\" hierarchy.\nHypothesis:\n1.  **Identify Lines:** lines are color segments and potential gaps.\n2.  **Repair Lines:** Change endpoints/Caps to match body. Fill Gaps.\n3.  **Handle Intersections:** Apply a rule on what color over-writes what.\n\n**Introducing Cap Colors & Directions**\n\nExample 3 is now a critical test. I am checking the concept of caps and intersection rules. There, a cap or endpoint can be a solid point and the endpoint of a line segment. The yellow in this example is at the end of a moving line segment. How does a color \"4\" at the endpoint effect the rest of the line. The Yellow pixel somehow defines the output. The intersection points may be overwritten by the higher colored segment.\n\nI am starting to believe there is a link between cap colors and the direction in which lines \"extend\" or are modified. For the test input, I need to check for this behavior.\n\n**The \"Yellow Cap\" Hypothesis and Line Mobility**\n\nIn Example 4, I see vertical and horizontal lines intersecting. An important idea has emerged:  some cap colors imply *movement* or *directionality*. The yellow \"cap\" creates \"moving\" behavior, and \"red\" or a similar color may indicate static endpoints. I'm getting closer to a system. The key to ARC is usually: 1) Identify the pattern. 2) Apply the pattern.\n\n**Formulating the Dominance Hierarchy and Defining the Rules**\n\nThe evidence suggests a dominance hierarchy among the colors. It seems that \"static\" lines (those without directional caps) might be \"stronger\" than \"moving\" lines. At intersections, I need a rule for determining the \"winning\" color. I think the numerical order of the color might indicate dominance.  I'm forming a working hypothesis of Static > Moving.\n\n**Test Input - The Final Validation**\n\nFinally, I'm ready for the test input. It's time to put everything together. I need to:\n1.  Identify all the lines (static and moving).\n2.  Apply the dominance rule at intersections.\n\nBased on the earlier analysis, the rule is : 1 (Blue) > 3 (Green) > 6(Magenta) > 7 (Orange). And Static lines > Moving lines. Also, if there are multiple static lines, the dominant one will over write. If there are no static lines, moving ones will be dominant.\nI need to check how the yellow `4` cap impacts a segment.\n\nI'll proceed with this step-by-step approach. Once I have the output grid, I can check each row and column and fill in the solution. Let's start.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by identifying and completing lines defined by color segments and specific \"cap\" pixels. Based on the examples, here are the inferred rules:\n\n1.  **Line Identification**:\n    *   **Lines** are horizontal or vertical sequences of a main color (e.g., Orange 7, Green 3, Magenta 6).\n    *   **Caps** are pixels of a different color at the ends of these sequences that define the line's extent or behavior.\n        *   **Red (2)** acts as a **Static Endpoint**. A line segment is filled with the main color between two endpoints (or between a grid boundary and an endpoint).\n        *   **Yellow (4)** acts as a **Mobile Source**. It indicates the start of a line that extends in the direction away from the line's current body (e.g., if 4 is at the bottom, the line extends down; if at the right, it extends right). This implies a \"moving\" line.\n\n2.  **Line Completion**:\n    *   Gaps (0s) within the defined extent of a line are filled with the line's main color.\n    *   The Cap pixels themselves (2, 4) are replaced by the line's main color.\n\n3.  **Intersection Dominance**:\n    *   When lines cross, one color overwrites the other.\n    *   **Static vs. Moving**: Static lines (bounded by 2 or grid edges) appear to dominate Moving lines (initiated by 4).\n    *   **Color Hierarchy**: Between Static lines, there is a hierarchy. Based on examples (1 > 3 > 7 and 1 > 6), and inferring for the test case (6 vs 7), we observe that lower numbers (Blue 1, Green 3) dominate higher numbers (Orange 7). Following this pattern and visual prominence in the test grid, Magenta (6) dominates Orange (7).\n\n**Application to Test Input**:\n\n*   **Vertical Lines (Orange 7)**:\n    *   **Col 1**: Defined by Red caps (2) at Row 3 and Row 9. The line fills Rows 3-9 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Col 4**: Defined by start at Row 0 and Red cap (2) at Row 3. Fills Rows 0-3 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Col 7**: Defined by Red caps (2) at Row 3 and Row 9. Fills Rows 3-9 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Col 10 (Top)**: Defined by start at Row 0 and Red cap (2) at Row 3. Fills Rows 0-3 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Col 10 (Bottom)**: Defined by Yellow cap (4) at Row 4. This indicates a moving line extending downwards. Fills Rows 4-11 with Orange (7).\n\n*   **Horizontal Lines (Orange 7)**:\n    *   **Row 3 (Left)**: Defined by Yellow cap (4) at Col 0 and Red cap (2) at Col 4. It fills Cols 0-4 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Row 3 (Right)**: Defined by Red caps (2) at Col 7 and Col 10. Fills Cols 7-10 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Row 9**: Defined by Red caps (2) at Col 1 and Col 7. Fills Cols 1-7 with Orange (7).\n\n*   **Horizontal Line (Magenta 6)**:\n    *   **Row 7**: A complete static line of Magenta (6) spanning Cols 0-11.\n\n*   **Resolving Intersections**:\n    *   **Row 7**: The Magenta (6) line crosses the Vertical Orange (7) lines at Cols 1, 7, and 10. Since 6 > 7 (and Static 6 > Moving 7), the pixels at (7,1), (7,7), and (7,10) become 6. The entire Row 7 is 6.\n    *   **Row 3**: The Horizontal Orange lines merge with the Vertical Orange lines at intersections (3,1), (3,4), (3,7), (3,10). The color remains 7.\n    *   **Row 9**: The Horizontal Orange line merges with Vertical Orange lines at (9,1) and (9,7). The color remains 7.\n\n**Final Grid Construction**:\n*   **Rows 0-2**: Vertical Orange segments at Cols 4 and 10.\n*   **Row 3**: Horizontal Orange segments (0-4, 7-10).\n*   **Rows 4-6**: Vertical

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_7_step_5_image\">\n**Okay, let's break down this ARC problem. I'm seeing a pattern here that's starting to crystallize.** It looks like my task is to take an input grid filled with colors, along with examples that contain clues, and transform it into an output grid. The trick is understanding how \"marker\" pixels and line continuations work.\n\n**First, I'm analyzing the provided examples**. I'm looking for the distinct colored lines and the special \"markers\". In the initial examples, I notice that the marker pixels are often at corners or gaps in lines. My hypothesis is that they connect or extend those lines.\n\n**I'm exploring the colors.** Each color seems to represent a separate line, or circuit, or something like that.  I'm trying to figure out if there's any hierarchy or interaction between the colors when they overlap. For now, it seems like some colors might have priority when lines cross.\n\n**The images are really important.** They show what the continuous, output should look like, even if the text data is a little tricky. The images clarify the path of these colored lines and show how they are restored.\n\n**Markers are the key!**  They can turn into the color of adjacent lines or are a way to make the lines continue. My general strategy for the output is this:\n1.  **Identify the line segments for each color**.\n2.  **Connect gaps in the lines**.\n3.  **Marker pixels are important**, so make sure they're the same color as the lines they touch.\n4.  **Resolve crossings** I have an assumption: \"Vertical lines overwrite Horizontal lines\".\n\n**Finally, for the test input, I'm tracing those lines, identifying the markers, and connecting the dots (or pixels)**. I'll make sure there are no gaps and that the lines flow as they should, with the right hierarchy on overlaps. Let's see if this works!\n\n\nThe problem requires inferring a transformation rule from the given examples and applying it to the test input.\n\n**Transformation Rules Inferred:**\n1.  **Identify Distinct Colored Paths:** The grid contains fragmented paths of specific colors (e.g., green, blue, orange, magenta). These paths are often broken by empty cells (0) or markers.\n2.  **Markers as Connectors:** There are \"marker\" pixels (colors like 2 or 4) that do not belong to the main path colors but serve as structural guides.\n    *   **Connecting Segments:** If a marker connects two segments of the same color (orthogonally), the marker takes on that color, and the path becomes continuous. This often forms corners or joins linear segments.\n    *   **Extensions:** If a marker (specifically the yellow '4' in the examples) appears at the end of a segment or adjacent to a corner such that it implies a straight continuation, the path extends through the marker and continues in that direction to the edge of the grid or until it connects to another segment.\n3.  **Filling Gaps:** Once the paths are defined by the segments and markers, any gaps (0s) along the straight lines of the path are filled with the path's color.\n4.  **Crossings / Layering:** When a vertical path and a horizontal path cross:\n    *   The **vertical** path appears to be on top. The cell at the intersection takes the color of the vertical path.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Colors Identified:** Orange (7), Magenta (6). Markers are Red (2) and Yellow (4).\n*   **Orange Path Reconstruction:**\n    *   Vertical segments at Column 4 (top), Column 1 (middle), Column 7 (middle), Column 10 (top).\n    *   Horizontal segments at Row 3 (left and right), Row 9 (middle).\n    *   **Red Markers (2):**\n        *   `(3,4)` connects Col 4 (top) and Row 3 (left). Becomes 7.\n        *   `(3,1)` connects Row 3 (right) and Col 1 (down). Becomes 7.\n        *   `(9,1)` connects Col 1 (up) and Row 9 (right). Becomes 7.\n        *   `(9,7)` connects Row 9 (left) and Col 7 (up). Becomes 7.\n        *   `(3,7)` connects Col 7 (down) and Row 3 (right). Becomes 7.\n        *   `(3,10)` connects Row 3 (left) and Col 10 (up). Becomes 7.\n    *   This forms a single continuous winding Orange path.\n*   **Extensions (Yellow Markers 4):**\n    *   `(3,0)` is a marker 4 adjacent to the corner at `(3,1)`. It implies an extension to the left. `(3,0)` becomes 7.\n    *   `(4,10)` is a marker 4 adjacent to the corner at `(3,10)`. It implies an extension downwards. Column 10 is filled with 7s from row 4 down to row 11.\n*   **Magenta Path:**\n    *   Row 7 contains a horizontal Magenta (6) line.\n    *   It has a gap at `(7,7)` (which is 0).\n*   **Crossings:**\n    *   **Column 1:** Orange vertical path crosses Magenta horizontal path at `(7,1)`. Vertical wins -> 7.\n    *   **Column 7:** Orange vertical path crosses Magenta horizontal path at `(7,7)`. Vertical wins -> 7.\n    *   **Column 10:** Extended Orange vertical path crosses Magenta horizontal path at `(7,10)`. Vertical wins -> 7.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   Orange path is filled in, including extensions and converted markers.\n*   Magenta path is preserved, except where overwritten by Orange.\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,7,7,7,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n6,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,7,6\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_C>\n<REASONING_MODEL_D model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_9_step_5_deep_thinking\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the following transformation rules:\n\n1. **Markers (2 or 4)** indicate junction points where lines meet or corners where lines should extend\n2. **Lines should be made continuous** by filling gaps and replacing markers with the appropriate line color\n3. **At intersections**, when one line has a gap (value different from the line's color), the gap gets filled with that line's color, overwriting any existing value\n4. **When both lines have gaps at an intersection**, vertical lines take precedence\n5. **The 4 marker** specifically indicates a line should extend (typically to the grid edge)\n\nAnalyzing the test input:\n- Vertical 7 lines at column 4 (rows 0-3) and column 10 (rows 0-11, extending from marker 4 at row 4)\n- Vertical 7 lines at columns 1 and 7 (rows 3-9, between markers at rows 3 and 9)\n- Horizontal 7 lines at row 3 (columns 0-4 and 7-10) and row 9 (columns 1-7)\n- Horizontal 6 line at row 7 (columns 0-11 with gap at column 7)\n\nTransformations applied:\n- Replace 2 markers with 7 (line color)\n- Replace 4 markers with 7 and extend lines\n- Fill gaps in horizontal 6 line at row 7\n- At row 7 intersections with vertical 7 lines (columns 1, 7, 10), vertical 7 wins\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,7,7,7,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n6,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,7,6\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_D>\n</CANDIDATE 4>\n<CANDIDATE 5>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 12x12\n000070000070\n000070000070\n000070000070\n777770077770\n070000070070\n070000070000\n070000070000\n676666676666\n070000070000\n077777770000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Lines and markers**: Each example has horizontal and vertical lines of a consistent color (like 1s, 3s, 6s, 7s) with \"markers\" (2s or 4s) indicating line boundaries/corners.\n\n2. **Line completion**: Lines with gaps are filled in between markers.

The goal? To crack this ARC code!**\n\nFirst, I'm noting that the input is always a grid filled with numbers, and we're looking for patterns in how these numbers change. The transformations are driven by lines and the clever use of \"markers\" like '2' and '4'.\n\n**Lines and their Endpoints:**\n\nThe examples are teaching me about different colored lines, like the Blue (1), Green (3), Orange (7), and Magenta (6). I'm looking closely at how they connect and intersect. The main thing seems to be that they can have \"endpoints\" marked with numbers like '2' and '4'.\n\n**2-Markers: The Connector**\n\n'2' seems to mark where lines either start or end, a little bit like the end of a train track. My current rule here is if there are two '2's, then fill between them with the same color as the line. \"Connect the dots.\" If there's a 2 at the end of a line, just convert that 2 to the line's color.\n\n**4-Markers: The Shape Shifter**\n\n'4' is the real trickster here. It signals a move - a shift or extend and cut! This marker has these rules:\n*   Find the color that is attached to '4'.\n*   I figure out the direction: from the connected pixel *towards* the '4' on the same line.\n*   Extend that color to the edge of the grid in that direction.\n*   Remove the original path leading to the 4 in the opposite direction.\n    *   This is tricky. It is either the full line section to be removed, or more subtle, only to a \"junction\" or the marker itself. Think about it like you're moving a piece of the track.\n\nThe Intersection Rule:\nI figured that the lines may sometimes break apart at the crossing points. This is like a \"Line completion\". In these cases: If one color has a gap (like it's interrupted by another color), and the same color exists on either side, fill the gap. And the active path wins out, even if broken!\n\n**Applying the Rules to Test Input**\n\nI am now reading the test input's grid and identifying the lines and markers. I'll transform, step by step, using the rule set I just made.\n\n**Test Input:**\n\nRight away, I see I have lots of vertical and horizontal lines. Also, the `2` markers bound and complete horizontal orange lines. And `4` starts the shift in location for the original orange line.\n\n**My Plan**\n\n1.  Identify the main line's sections with the colors - for now I'm thinking the line is `7`.\n2.  Start with the `4` marker at `(3,0)`. Push the line left to the grid edge at `(3,0)`.\n3.  The other `4` marker is `(4,10)`. Push this orange line down to the grid bottom at C10.\n4.  Remove the parts that are no longer part of the orange lines - the original horizontal segment is removed.\n5.  What about intersections, will the 7 line, at the intersection, \"win\" over the Magenta (6) line? Yes!\n\nI hope this all works, time to put the plan into action!\n\n\nTo solve this task, we need to understand the transformation rules governing the interaction between \"Linear Paths\" (colors 1, 3, 6, 7), \"Background\" (0), and \"Endpoint Markers\" (2, 4). Based on the provided examples, the logic is as follows:\n\n**1. Marker Behaviors:**\n*   **Marker '2' (Endpoint Connector):** These markers denote the terminals of a line segment. The transformation converts the '2's into the adjacent path color. If two '2's define a segment with path color (or gaps) between them, the entire segment is filled with the path color, completing the line.\n*   **Marker '4' (Extend & Trim):** This marker indicates a shift or extension of the path.\n    *   **Identify Direction:** Find the adjacent pixel with a path color (1, 3, 6, 7). The direction *from* that path pixel *towards* the '4' is the direction of extension.\n    *   **Extend:** The path color is extended from the marker's position to the grid edge in that direction.\n    *   **Trim:** The original path segment on the \"opposite side\" (the source direction) is removed (turned to 0). This removal creates a new endpoint for the line structure at the marker's location. Any disconnected components resulting from this trim (like the vertical line at column 4 in the test input) are also deleted.\n\n**2. Line Completion & Priority:**\n*   **Gap Filling:** Straight lines of path colors are continuous. Any gaps (0) or markers (2) within a logical segment are filled with the path color.\n*   **Intersection Priority:** When two lines cross, the line that is being \"completed\" or \"filled\" (usually the one with markers or the one that had a gap at the intersection) overwrites the existing continuous pixels of the other line. In this specific task, the Orange (7) structure is the \"active\" one being manipulated by markers, so it overwrites the static Magenta (6) line at intersections.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Structures:**\n    *   **Orange (7) Structure:**\n        *   **Top Verticals:** Two vertical lines coming down from Row 0 at Col 4 and Col 10, ending at Row 3 (marked by 2s).\n        *   **Row 3 Horizontal:** A complex line containing markers.\n            *   Left side: `4` at `(3,0)`, adjacent to `2` at `(3,1)`. Segment `(3,1)` to `(3,4)` (ends in 2).\n            *   Right side: Segment `(3,7)` to `(3,10)` (bounded by 2s).\n        *   **Middle Verticals:** Vertical lines at Col 1 and Col 7, running from Row 3 down to Row 9.\n        *   **Row 9 Horizontal:** A segment connecting Col 1 and Col 7 (bounded by 2s).\n    *   **Magenta (6) Structure:** A horizontal line at Row 7 with a gap at Col 7.\n\n2.  **Apply Marker '4' Rules:**\n    *   **At `(3,0)`:** Adjacent to the path start at `(3,1)` (implied color 7). Direction is **Left**.\n        *   **Action:** Extend 7 into `(3,0)`.\n        *   **Trim:** Remove the path to the Right of `(3,1)`. This deletes the segment `(3,2)` to `(3,4)`. Consequently, the vertical line at Col 4 (connected at `(3,4)`) becomes disconnected and is removed.\n    *   **At `(4,10)`:** Adjacent to the path endpoint `(3,10)` (implied color 7). Direction is **Down**.\n        *   **Action:** Extend 7 from `(4,10)` down to the bottom edge (Row 11).\n        *   **Trim:** Remove the path \"upstream\" from the anchor `(3,10)`. The vertical line coming from above (Top Col 10) is removed. The horizontal connection to the left `(3,7)-(3,10)` remains as it is orthogonal to the extension.\n\n3.  **Apply Line Completion:**\n    *   **Row 3:** The segment `(3,7)` to `(3,10)` is filled with 7. The markers at `(3,1)` and `(3,10)` become 7. The gap `(3,5)-(3,6)` remains 0.\n    *   **Verticals (Col 1, Col 7):** These are preserved and filled.\n    *   **Row 9:** The segment between Col 1 and Col 7 is filled with 7.\n\n4.  **Handle Intersections (Row 7):**\n    *   The Magenta (6) line crosses the Vertical 7s at Col 1, Col 7, and the Extension 7 at Col 10.\n    *   Since the 7-lines are the active structure (filled gaps/extended), they overwrite the Magenta line.\n    *   `(7,1)` becomes 7. `(7,7)` becomes 7. `(7,10)` becomes 7.\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid:**\n*   **Rows 0-2:** Empty (Top verticals removed).\n*   **Row 3:** `7` at C0, C1 (Extension). `7` at C7-C10 (Preserved segment).

What *actually* happened?\"\n  3. **Verdict:** \"Do they match?\"\n- **Fatal Contradictions to Watch For:**\n  * **Scope Error:** Rule applies to specific colors (e.g., \"Blue\"), but the example changes \"Red\" pixels.\n  * **Geometry Error:** Rule says \"rotate 90,\" but example shows a flip.\n  * **Object Error:** Rule treats pixels individually, but example shows objects moving as blocks.\n- *Constraint:* Record exactly how many Solved Examples the candidate PASSED vs FAILED. **Do not stop at the first failure**; check all examples to determine the severity of the failure (e.g., \"Passed 2/3 Examples\").\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n- For Candidates that survived Phase 2 (or passed at least one example):\n- Look at the {{TEST_INPUT}} and the Candidate's <PROPOSED_SOLUTION> grid.\n- Does the proposed output actually follow the Crystallized Rule?\n- *Common Hallucination:* The text says \"Move Blue,\" but the grid shows Blue staying still. Mark this as **INTERNAL_CONTRADICTION**.\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING & TIE-BREAKING\n- Rank ALL candidates from Best to Worst based on this hierarchy:\n  1. **GOLD (Tier 1):** Passed ALL Solved Examples + Consistent Execution on Test Input.\n  2. **SILVER (Tier 2):** Passed ALL Solved Examples + Minor Execution Error on Test Input.\n  3. **BRONZE (Tier 3):** Passed MOST Solved Examples (Partial Logic).\n  4. **INVALID (Tier 4):** Failed ALL/MOST Solved Examples, Vague Reasoning, or Severe Internal Contradictions.\n\n- **Tie-Breaking:** If two candidates are in the same Tier, rank the one with the **Simplest Rule** (Occam's Razor) higher.\n</AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\n\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfit\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",

I'm presented with several solved examples and one test case. The input always includes grids with colored lines, horizontal and vertical, with varying degrees of complexity, including intersections and gaps. The output is a modified grid, and I need to deduce the transformation rules. My initial instinct is to analyze the examples systematically, noting the changes to the lines, especially at intersection points. I need to look for patterns in how colors interact and how lines are modified. The test input will be used to validate my hypothesis.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis: Decoding Line Transformations**\n\nIn Example 1, the core seems to involve \"lines,\" defined as sequences of pixels with the same color. There are horizontal and vertical lines of different colors, and intersections, too. In the output grid, lines appear to be *completed* or *extended*. For instance, the vertical \"blue\" line is extended, and its color appears to \"overwrite\" the horizontal \"green\" line at their intersection. My immediate thought is, are there dominance rules? Maybe one color \"wins\" at an intersection. Also, are endpoint colors important? The red endpoints of the horizontal green line become green in the output. This suggests that the endpoints change to match the line color.\n\n**Refining Line Definition and Intersection Dominance**\n\nI'm now thinking I need to be more precise about what constitutes a \"line.\" It's a continuous run of identical non-black pixels, possibly with caps or other color intersections. I'm focusing on two key elements: \"filling gaps\" and \"line extensions\". I also need to figure out how to handle \"cap\" colors. Are they always endpoints? Or can they indicate directions?\n\nExample 2 is interesting. Here, a yellow pixel \"intrudes\" into a green horizontal line. The line seems to shift in the output, and the Yellow pixel somehow defines the output. I also notice that the line color at intersections is not always consistent - which color \"wins\"?\n\nI hypothesize that the intersection outcomes are determined by a \"Dominance\" hierarchy.\nHypothesis:\n1.  **Identify Lines:** lines are color segments and potential gaps.\n2.  **Repair Lines:** Change endpoints/Caps to match body. Fill Gaps.\n3.  **Handle Intersections:** Apply a rule on what color over-writes what.\n\n**Introducing Cap Colors & Directions**\n\nExample 3 is now a critical test. I am checking the concept of caps and intersection rules. There, a cap or endpoint can be a solid point and the endpoint of a line segment. The yellow in this example is at the end of a moving line segment. How does a color \"4\" at the endpoint effect the rest of the line. The Yellow pixel somehow defines the output. The intersection points may be overwritten by the higher colored segment.\n\nI am starting to believe there is a link between cap colors and the direction in which lines \"extend\" or are modified. For the test input, I need to check for this behavior.\n\n**The \"Yellow Cap\" Hypothesis and Line Mobility**\n\nIn Example 4, I see vertical and horizontal lines intersecting. An important idea has emerged:  some cap colors imply *movement* or *directionality*. The yellow \"cap\" creates \"moving\" behavior, and \"red\" or a similar color may indicate static endpoints. I'm getting closer to a system. The key to ARC is usually: 1) Identify the pattern. 2) Apply the pattern.\n\n**Formulating the Dominance Hierarchy and Defining the Rules**\n\nThe evidence suggests a dominance hierarchy among the colors. It seems that \"static\" lines (those without directional caps) might be \"stronger\" than \"moving\" lines. At intersections, I need a rule for determining the \"winning\" color. I think the numerical order of the color might indicate dominance.  I'm forming a working hypothesis of Static > Moving.\n\n**Test Input - The Final Validation**\n\nFinally, I'm ready for the test input. It's time to put everything together. I need to:\n1.  Identify all the lines (static and moving).\n2.  Apply the dominance rule at intersections.\n\nBased on the earlier analysis, the rule is : 1 (Blue) > 3 (Green) > 6(Magenta) > 7 (Orange). And Static lines > Moving lines. Also, if there are multiple static lines, the dominant one will over write. If there are no static lines, moving ones will be dominant.\nI need to check how the yellow `4` cap impacts a segment.\n\nI'll proceed with this step-by-step approach. Once I have the output grid, I can check each row and column and fill in the solution. Let's start.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by identifying and completing lines defined by color segments and specific \"cap\" pixels. Based on the examples, here are the inferred rules:\n\n1.  **Line Identification**:\n    *   **Lines** are horizontal or vertical sequences of a main color (e.g., Orange 7, Green 3, Magenta 6).\n    *   **Caps** are pixels of a different color at the ends of these sequences that define the line's extent or behavior.\n        *   **Red (2)** acts as a **Static Endpoint**. A line segment is filled with the main color between two endpoints (or between a grid boundary and an endpoint).\n        *   **Yellow (4)** acts as a **Mobile Source**. It indicates the start of a line that extends in the direction away from the line's current body (e.g., if 4 is at the bottom, the line extends down; if at the right, it extends right). This implies a \"moving\" line.\n\n2.  **Line Completion**:\n    *   Gaps (0s) within the defined extent of a line are filled with the line's main color.\n    *   The Cap pixels themselves (2, 4) are replaced by the line's main color.\n\n3.  **Intersection Dominance**:\n    *   When lines cross, one color overwrites the other.\n    *   **Static vs. Moving**: Static lines (bounded by 2 or grid edges) appear to dominate Moving lines (initiated by 4).\n    *   **Color Hierarchy**: Between Static lines, there is a hierarchy. Based on examples (1 > 3 > 7 and 1 > 6), and inferring for the test case (6 vs 7), we observe that lower numbers (Blue 1, Green 3) dominate higher numbers (Orange 7). Following this pattern and visual prominence in the test grid, Magenta (6) dominates Orange (7).\n\n**Application to Test Input**:\n\n*   **Vertical Lines (Orange 7)**:\n    *   **Col 1**: Defined by Red caps (2) at Row 3 and Row 9. The line fills Rows 3-9 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Col 4**: Defined by start at Row 0 and Red cap (2) at Row 3. Fills Rows 0-3 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Col 7**: Defined by Red caps (2) at Row 3 and Row 9. Fills Rows 3-9 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Col 10 (Top)**: Defined by start at Row 0 and Red cap (2) at Row 3. Fills Rows 0-3 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Col 10 (Bottom)**: Defined by Yellow cap (4) at Row 4. This indicates a moving line extending downwards. Fills Rows 4-11 with Orange (7).\n\n*   **Horizontal Lines (Orange 7)**:\n    *   **Row 3 (Left)**: Defined by Yellow cap (4) at Col 0 and Red cap (2) at Col 4. It fills Cols 0-4 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Row 3 (Right)**: Defined by Red caps (2) at Col 7 and Col 10. Fills Cols 7-10 with Orange (7).\n    *   **Row 9**: Defined by Red caps (2) at Col 1 and Col 7. Fills Cols 1-7 with Orange (7).\n\n*   **Horizontal Line (Magenta 6)**:\n    *   **Row 7**: A complete static line of Magenta (6) spanning Cols 0-11.\n\n*   **Resolving Intersections**:\n    *   **Row 7**: The Magenta (6) line crosses the Vertical Orange (7) lines at Cols 1, 7, and 10. Since 6 > 7 (and Static 6 > Moving 7), the pixels at (7,1), (7,7), and (7,10) become 6. The entire Row 7 is 6.\n    *   **Row 3**: The Horizontal Orange lines merge with the Vertical Orange lines at intersections (3,1), (3,4), (3,7), (3,10). The color remains 7.\n    *   **Row 9**: The Horizontal Orange line merges with Vertical Orange lines at (9,1) and (9,7). The color remains 7.\n\n**Final Grid Construction**:\n*   **Rows 0-2**: Vertical Orange segments at Cols 4 and 10.\n*   **Row 3**: Horizontal Orange segments (0-4, 7-10).\n*   **Rows 4-6**: Vertical Orange segments at Cols 1, 7, 10.\n*   **Row 7**: Full Magenta line.\n*   **Row 8**: Vertical Orange segments at Cols 1, 7, 10.\n*   **Row 9**: Horizontal Orange segment (1-7) and Vertical Orange at Col 10.\n*   **Rows 10-11**: Vertical Orange segment at Col 10.\n\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,7,7,7,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n

I'm seeing a pattern here that's starting to crystallize.** It looks like my task is to take an input grid filled with colors, along with examples that contain clues, and transform it into an output grid. The trick is understanding how \"marker\" pixels and line continuations work.\n\n**First, I'm analyzing the provided examples**. I'm looking for the distinct colored lines and the special \"markers\". In the initial examples, I notice that the marker pixels are often at corners or gaps in lines. My hypothesis is that they connect or extend those lines.\n\n**I'm exploring the colors.** Each color seems to represent a separate line, or circuit, or something like that.  I'm trying to figure out if there's any hierarchy or interaction between the colors when they overlap. For now, it seems like some colors might have priority when lines cross.\n\n**The images are really important.** They show what the continuous, output should look like, even if the text data is a little tricky. The images clarify the path of these colored lines and show how they are restored.\n\n**Markers are the key!**  They can turn into the color of adjacent lines or are a way to make the lines continue. My general strategy for the output is this:\n1.  **Identify the line segments for each color**.\n2.  **Connect gaps in the lines**.\n3.  **Marker pixels are important**, so make sure they're the same color as the lines they touch.\n4.  **Resolve crossings** I have an assumption: \"Vertical lines overwrite Horizontal lines\".\n\n**Finally, for the test input, I'm tracing those lines, identifying the markers, and connecting the dots (or pixels)**. I'll make sure there are no gaps and that the lines flow as they should, with the right hierarchy on overlaps. Let's see if this works!\n\n\nThe problem requires inferring a transformation rule from the given examples and applying it to the test input.\n\n**Transformation Rules Inferred:**\n1.  **Identify Distinct Colored Paths:** The grid contains fragmented paths of specific colors (e.g., green, blue, orange, magenta). These paths are often broken by empty cells (0) or markers.\n2.  **Markers as Connectors:** There are \"marker\" pixels (colors like 2 or 4) that do not belong to the main path colors but serve as structural guides.\n    *   **Connecting Segments:** If a marker connects two segments of the same color (orthogonally), the marker takes on that color, and the path becomes continuous. This often forms corners or joins linear segments.\n    *   **Extensions:** If a marker (specifically the yellow '4' in the examples) appears at the end of a segment or adjacent to a corner such that it implies a straight continuation, the path extends through the marker and continues in that direction to the edge of the grid or until it connects to another segment.\n3.  **Filling Gaps:** Once the paths are defined by the segments and markers, any gaps (0s) along the straight lines of the path are filled with the path's color.\n4.  **Crossings / Layering:** When a vertical path and a horizontal path cross:\n    *   The **vertical** path appears to be on top. The cell at the intersection takes the color of the vertical path.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Colors Identified:** Orange (7), Magenta (6). Markers are Red (2) and Yellow (4).\n*   **Orange Path Reconstruction:**\n    *   Vertical segments at Column 4 (top), Column 1 (middle), Column 7 (middle), Column 10 (top).\n    *   Horizontal segments at Row 3 (left and right), Row 9 (middle).\n    *   **Red Markers (2):**\n        *   `(3,4)` connects Col 4 (top) and Row 3 (left). Becomes 7.\n        *   `(3,1)` connects Row 3 (right) and Col 1 (down). Becomes 7.\n        *   `(9,1)` connects Col 1 (up) and Row 9 (right). Becomes 7.\n        *   `(9,7)` connects Row 9 (left) and Col 7 (up). Becomes 7.\n        *   `(3,7)` connects Col 7 (down) and Row 3 (right). Becomes 7.\n        *   `(3,10)` connects Row 3 (left) and Col 10 (up). Becomes 7.\n    *   This forms a single continuous winding Orange path.\n*   **Extensions (Yellow Markers 4):**\n    *   `(3,0)` is a marker 4 adjacent to the corner at `(3,1)`. It implies an extension to the left. `(3,0)` becomes 7.\n    *   `(4,10)` is a marker 4 adjacent to the corner at `(3,10)`. It implies an extension downwards. Column 10 is filled with 7s from row 4 down to row 11.\n*   **Magenta Path:**\n    *   Row 7 contains a horizontal Magenta (6) line.\n    *   It has a gap at `(7,7)` (which is 0).\n*   **Crossings:**\n    *   **Column 1:** Orange vertical path crosses Magenta horizontal path at `(7,1)`.

The goal? To crack this ARC code!**\n\nFirst, I'm noting that the input is always a grid filled with numbers, and we're looking for patterns in how these numbers change. The transformations are driven by lines and the clever use of \"markers\" like '2' and '4'.\n\n**Lines and their Endpoints:**\n\nThe examples are teaching me about different colored lines, like the Blue (1), Green (3), Orange (7), and Magenta (6). I'm looking closely at how they connect and intersect. The main thing seems to be that they can have \"endpoints\" marked with numbers like '2' and '4'.\n\n**2-Markers: The Connector**\n\n'2' seems to mark where lines either start or end, a little bit like the end of a train track. My current rule here is if there are two '2's, then fill between them with the same color as the line. \"Connect the dots.\" If there's a 2 at the end of a line, just convert that 2 to the line's color.\n\n**4-Markers: The Shape Shifter**\n\n'4' is the real trickster here. It signals a move - a shift or extend and cut! This marker has these rules:\n*   Find the color that is attached to '4'.\n*   I figure out the direction: from the connected pixel *towards* the '4' on the same line.\n*   Extend that color to the edge of the grid in that direction.\n*   Remove the original path leading to the 4 in the opposite direction.\n    *   This is tricky. It is either the full line section to be removed, or more subtle, only to a \"junction\" or the marker itself. Think about it like you're moving a piece of the track.\n\nThe Intersection Rule:\nI figured that the lines may sometimes break apart at the crossing points. This is like a \"Line completion\". In these cases: If one color has a gap (like it's interrupted by another color), and the same color exists on either side, fill the gap. And the active path wins out, even if broken!\n\n**Applying the Rules to Test Input**\n\nI am now reading the test input's grid and identifying the lines and markers. I'll transform, step by step, using the rule set I just made.\n\n**Test Input:**\n\nRight away, I see I have lots of vertical and horizontal lines. Also, the `2` markers bound and complete horizontal orange lines. And `4` starts the shift in location for the original orange line.\n\n**My Plan**\n\n1.  Identify the main line's sections with the colors - for now I'm thinking the line is `7`.\n2.  Start with the `4` marker at `(3,0)`. Push the line left to the grid edge at `(3,0)`.\n3.  The other `4` marker is `(4,10)`. Push this orange line down to the grid bottom at C10.\n4.  Remove the parts that are no longer part of the orange lines - the original horizontal segment is removed.\n5.  What about intersections, will the 7 line, at the intersection, \"win\" over the Magenta (6) line? Yes!\n\nI hope this all works, time to put the plan into action!\n\n\nTo solve this task, we need to understand the transformation rules governing the interaction between \"Linear Paths\" (colors 1, 3, 6, 7), \"Background\" (0), and \"Endpoint Markers\" (2, 4). Based on the provided examples, the logic is as follows:\n\n**1. Marker Behaviors:**\n*   **Marker '2' (Endpoint Connector):** These markers denote the terminals of a line segment. The transformation converts the '2's into the adjacent path color. If two '2's define a segment with path color (or gaps) between them, the entire segment is filled with the path color, completing the line.\n*   **Marker '4' (Extend & Trim):** This marker indicates a shift or extension of the path.\n    *   **Identify Direction:** Find the adjacent pixel with a path color (1, 3, 6, 7). The direction *from* that path pixel *towards* the '4' is the direction of extension.\n    *   **Extend:** The path color is extended from the marker's position to the grid edge in that direction.\n    *   **Trim:** The original path segment on the \"opposite side\" (the source direction) is removed (turned to 0). This removal creates a new endpoint for the line structure at the marker's location. Any disconnected components resulting from this trim (like the vertical line at column 4 in the test input) are also deleted.\n\n**2. Line Completion & Priority:**\n*   **Gap Filling:** Straight lines of path colors are continuous. Any gaps (0) or markers (2) within a logical segment are filled with the path color.\n*   **Intersection Priority:** When two lines cross, the line that is being \"completed\" or \"filled\" (usually the one with markers or the one that had a gap at the intersection) overwrites the existing continuous pixels of the other line. In this specific task, the Orange (7) structure is the \"active\" one being manipulated by markers, so it overwrites the static Magenta (6) line at intersections.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Structures:**\n    *   **Orange (7) Structure:**\n        *   **Top Verticals:** Two vertical lines coming down from Row 0 at Col 4 and Col 10, ending at Row 3 (marked by 2s).\n        *   **Row 3 Horizontal:** A complex line containing markers.\n            *   Left side: `4` at `(3,0)`, adjacent to `2` at `(3,1)`. Segment `(3,1)` to `(3,4)` (ends in 2).\n            *   Right side: Segment `(3,7)` to `(3,10)` (bounded by 2s).\n        *   **Middle Verticals:** Vertical lines at Col 1 and Col 7, running from Row 3 down to Row 9.\n        *   **Row 9 Horizontal:** A segment connecting Col 1 and Col 7 (bounded by 2s).\n    *   **Magenta (6) Structure:** A horizontal line at Row 7 with a gap at Col 7.\n\n2.  **Apply Marker '4' Rules:**\n    *   **At `(3,0)`:** Adjacent to the path start at `(3,1)` (implied color 7). Direction is **Left**.\n        *   **Action:** Extend 7 into `(3,0)`.\n        *   **Trim:** Remove the path to the Right of `(3,1)`. This deletes the segment `(3,2)` to `(3,4)`. Consequently, the vertical line at Col 4 (connected at `(3,4)`) becomes disconnected and is removed.\n    *   **At `(4,10)`:** Adjacent to the path endpoint `(3,10)` (implied color 7). Direction is **Down**.\n        *   **Action:** Extend 7 from `(4,10)` down to the bottom edge (Row 11).\n        *   **Trim:** Remove the path \"upstream\" from the anchor `(3,10)`. The vertical line coming from above (Top Col 10) is removed. The horizontal connection to the left `(3,7)-(3,10)` remains as it is orthogonal to the extension.\n\n3.  **Apply Line Completion:**\n    *   **Row 3:** The segment `(3,7)` to `(3,10)` is filled with 7. The markers at `(3,1)` and `(3,10)` become 7. The gap `(3,5)-(3,6)` remains 0.\n    *   **Verticals (Col 1, Col 7):** These are preserved and filled.\n    *   **Row 9:** The segment between Col 1 and Col 7 is filled with 7.\n\n4.  **Handle Intersections (Row 7):**\n    *   The Magenta (6) line crosses the Vertical 7s at Col 1, Col 7, and the Extension 7 at Col 10.\n    *   Since the 7-lines are the active structure (filled gaps/extended), they overwrite the Magenta line.\n    *   `(7,1)` becomes 7. `(7,7)` becomes 7. `(7,10)` becomes 7.\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid:**\n*   **Rows 0-2:** Empty (Top verticals removed).\n*   **Row 3:** `7` at C0, C1 (Extension). `7` at C7-C10 (Preserved segment).

It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
