        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, the user wants me to solve an ARC task, likely involving some sort of pattern recognition and rule application. I need to analyze a set of solved examples (4) and a single test case to figure out the underlying logic. My initial thought is to break down the task into smaller sub-problems. First, I\u2019ll look at the examples and try to identify repeating structures, patterns, and relationships between the inputs and outputs. I'll pay close attention to any visual cues like colors, shapes, and spatial arrangements. Then, I\u2019ll formalize the rules and test them against the solved cases before applying them to the new test input.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nThis looks promising. I see a 24x24 grid, with some background color (8, teal). There are a few interesting structures here: small boxes. Let's look at the first box: Rows 9-12, Col 3-6.  It has a border (green, 3) and an inner color (maroon, 9). I'll note those coordinates.  The other boxes seem similar (green border with an interior color, different positions/colors). Let's see, there is also a Box with (blue, 1), and then a box (yellow, 4).  I'll compare the input boxes and see what the output is. Ah, the output. I see diagonal lines emanating from these boxes! Not always from the boxes, but radiating outwards. Let\u2019s try to identify how these \"rays\" are generated, I see some sort of diagonal pattern emerging, I will check the position of the box and compare with the output.  The original boxes are still visible but some pixels are replaced with rays. The pixels around the box have been changed! So, the border is there. This is a crucial observation.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s get a little more specific with coordinates, let\u2019s see the maroon (9), the original box pixels are at (10,4), (10,5), (11,4), (11,5). Let\u2019s compare with the output. Hmm, the output 9s appear in diagonal lines. This suggests a direction and distance relationship.  Let\u2019s trace the diagonal lines and compare their coordinate's,  this is probably important. Let's look for a pattern in the distances. Going back to my drawing board.\n\nOkay, it seems like the rays are based on the inner colors, not the outer border.  For this specific case, the inner color (9) is \"projected\" out diagonally in two directions to create the visual rays.  It seems to be filling the background. Ah, the green borders aren\u2019t there, the boxes themselves are still visible, but the background around them has been transformed into a diagonal pattern. Let me check the next one, looking at the blue one (1),  In the output, I\u2019m seeing vertical lines of 1s instead of diagonals. So, each box seems to generate a unique ray pattern! And, it appears the 3s (green) are somewhat irrelevant now. It looks like the rays go from those boxes and stop at a vertical line! This might be a rule.\n\nAh, I think I'm starting to get it. The direction is related to the hole in the border. Let's check the Yellow one (4) and see where the pattern changes in the output to confirm my hypothesis. Here, I see the Yellow one is projected up, but shifts, with the exception of the Magenta, the shift isn't completely vertical, it seems it shifted one step and the output is just a vertical line. Let me keep analyzing the hole and the border.  The output seems to change, is the board an influence? Let's check Ex 1 and confirm, the pattern changes to up vertical at the column 18 and a 3 by side-by-side! The box color influences the shape!\n\n**Formulation of Hypothesis & Rules:**\n\nI\u2019ve got a theory! The \u201cgreen\u201d border acts as a launcher or cannon for \"rays\" of the inner color. The \"missing\" green pixels in the 3x3 box determines the direction. So, corners shoot diagonals.  The \"missing\" ones on the sides, shoot straights! I am pretty sure this is the right direction!\n\n*   Closed Border: No ray or undefined shape!\n*   Missing corner creates a diagonal ray from that corner.\n*   Missing side creates a straight ray.\n\nLet me verify this, with those new hypothesis. I\u2019m starting with the maroon example (9). The corners are missing, the output reflects diagonal projections!  For the blue box, the corners are also missing, and the rays are also diagonals (X-shaped). The yellow one (4) has top and bottom\n\nThe solution involves simulating \"light rays\" emitted from colored boxes.\n\n**Logic:**\n1.  **Sources:** The grid contains several rectangular structures (boxes) defined by green (3) borders. Each box encloses a specific inner color.\n2.  **Emitters:** The green border is not always continuous. \"Holes\" (pixels in the 4x4 perimeter that are not 3, usually 8) act as emitters.\n    -   **Top/Bottom/Left/Right Edge Holes:** Emit straight rays (Vertical/Horizontal) outwards from the hole.\n    -   **Corner Holes:** Emit diagonal rays (45 degrees) outwards from the corner.\n3.  **Beam Color:** The rays consist of the color found inside the box.\n4.  **Interactions:**\n    -   **Solid Objects:** Rays are blocked by the green borders of other boxes.\n    -   **Ray Collisions:**\n        -   **Perpendicular/Crossing:** If a Horizontal ray hits a Vertical ray, the Horizontal ray typically stops (Vertical/Diagonal blocks Horizontal).\n        -   **Diagonal vs Vertical:** If a Diagonal ray intersects a Vertical ray, the Vertical ray is \"pushed\" or shifted sideways to run parallel to the diagonal ray.\n        -   **Diagonal vs Horizontal:** The Diagonal ray blocks the Horizontal ray.\n\n**Rays in Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Red Box (Inner 2):**\n    -   Hole at Top (4,4) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Up (Col 4).\n    -   Hole at Left (5,3) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Left (Row 5).\n    -   Hole at Bottom-Right (7,6) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal BR.\n\n2.  **Yellow Box (Inner 4):**\n    -   Hole at Top-Right (4,18) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal UR.\n    -   Hole at Right (5,18) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Right (Row 5). *Interaction:* Intersection with Magenta Up Ray at Col 23. Horizontal stops. Ray ends at Col 22.\n    -   Hole at Bottom (7,16) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Down (Col 16). *Interaction:* Intersection with Red BR Diagonal Ray at Row 17. The Vertical ray is pushed right by the Diagonal ray. From Row 17 onwards, it shifts to `(r, r)` path (Col = Row).\n\n3.  **Magenta Box (Inner 6):**\n    -   Hole at Top (13,23) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Up (Col 23).\n    -   Hole at Top-Right (13,25) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal UR.\n    -   Hole at Bottom-Right (16,25) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal BR.\n\n4.  **Orange Box (Inner 7):**\n    -   Hole at Right (20,24) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Right (Row 20). *Interaction:* Intersection with Magenta BR Diagonal Ray at Col 29. Horizontal stops at 28.\n    -   Hole at Bottom-Right (22,24) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal BR.\n\n5.  **Maroon Box (Inner 9):**\n    -   Hole at Top (24,3) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Up (Col 3). *Interaction:* Blocked by the bottom of the Red Box at Row 7 (specifically Row 7 Col 3 is a 3). Ray stops at Row 8.\n    -   Hole at Right (25,4) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Right (Row 25). *Interaction:* Intersection with Red BR Diagonal Ray at Col 24. Horizontal stops at 23.\n    -   Hole at Right (26,4) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Right (Row 26). *Interaction:* Intersection with Red BR Diagonal Ray at Col 25. Horizontal stops at 24.\n    -   Hole at Bottom-Right (27,4) $\\rightarrow$ Ray Diagonal BR.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,2,4,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Solution for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given examples and a test input. My job is to figure out the rule and apply it. Let's break this down.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\n*   I'm looking at grids, mainly filled with one color (like blue in the first example), with some small, organized structures embedded within them. These structures are the key.\n*   They seem to be a specific color with a green border. But the border isn't a perfect square. This is important.\n*   The output grids show diagonal lines or \"rays\" originating from these structures, with the color of the inner part of the structure.\n\n**Diving into the Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1**: The first thing I see are these structures with a green, slightly irregular border. Inside, there's a 2x2 block of a different color. My gut tells me these are \"pods\" of some kind.\n    *   I carefully examine the border shape. It looks like a square with the corners removed, which I'll call a \"damaged\" border or broken box.\n    *   The output has lines of the inner color (e.g. 9) extending out diagonally from the pods. The lines seem to follow these directions:\n        *   Each corner of each pod border is a hole.\n\n*   **Example 2**: I'm on the right track, with a smaller grid and only one pod.\n    *   There's also this damaged border with a hole (missing green).\n    *   The output shows a diagonal line, and it's starting where there is a broken border!\n        *   This seems to reinforce the idea that the direction of the lines in the output relates to the shape of the border.\n    *   A bit of further observation about the output indicates that the lines might be related to which parts of the pod is \"missing\" (not 3), and \"rays\" get launched from there, like lights from a lighthouse! The rays' directions change according to the \"missing\" border segments.\n\n*   **Hypothesis Formulation:** I'm starting to get a clear picture. Here's my working hypothesis:\n    1.  **Identify Pods:** Find a 2x2 core of a certain color ($C_{core}$) surrounded by a damaged green border (3).\n    2.  **Hole Detection:** Examine the border. The border should have a full square shape, with all the sides, except for those that have 8 or a similar non-3 value, which defines a *hole*.\n    3.  **Ray Launch:** For each hole, project a line of the inner color $C_{core}$ outwards in a specific direction determined by the position of the hole in the bounding box. Corners move diagonally.\n\n*   I'm testing this hypothesis carefully with Example 2, checking each part of the border. I see the pattern. It's the holes, which act like launch points for rays.\n    *   When the border is broken, with a pixel that is not 3, that defines a direction for the ray.\n\n**Refining the Rule:**\n\n*   I see a difference between a pod, versus a \"damaged\" border.\n    *   A perfect box boundary has corners, and these don't lead to lines, since they are not considered holes.\n\n*   I need a formal definition of a \"hole\" or \"damaged\" position:\n    *   Scan the 4x4 bounding box around the 2x2 core.\n    *   Any boundary pixel that is not a 3 is a *hole*.\n    *   For corner pixels that are non-3, diagonal lines get emitted from that location.\n*   I check my rule against the examples again to confirm. This is making sense!\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Pod Identification:** I'll scan the test input grid and look for 2x2 blocks of colors that aren't 3 or 8. These are my cores.\n2.  **Boundary & Hole Detection:** I draw the 4x4 bounding box around each core, then I'll find all the non-3 values within that border, which defines the hole.\n3.  **Ray Generation:** For each hole, the location defines the start of a ray.\n\nI'm systematically going through the test input:\n\n*   I identify five pods.\n*   For each pod, I carefully analyze the borders, identifying the positions of all the 3's and the non-3's. Non-3's means hole.\n*   The position defines the direction of the ray.\n\n**Conflict Resolution:**\n\n*   What happens when rays cross or overlap\n\nThe transformation involves identifying \"pods\" in the grid and projecting colored lines from them.\n\n**Rules inferred from examples:**\n1.  **Identify Pods:** Look for 4x4 structures that consist of a border of green (3) pixels surrounding a 2x2 core of a distinct color $C$. The border occupies the perimeter of the 4x4 area.\n2.  **Identify Holes:** Examine the 12-pixel border of each 4x4 pod. A \"Hole\" is any pixel in this border that is **not** green (3). In the examples, holes are typically background color (8) or sometimes the core color if the pod is \"damaged\".\n3.  **Project Rays:** For each Hole found:\n    *   Determine the direction of the ray based on the Hole's position relative to the pod's center:\n        *   **Top Edge (non-corner):** Project **Up** (Vertical).\n        *   **Bottom Edge (non-corner):** Project **Down** (Vertical).\n        *   **Left Edge (non-corner):** Project **Left** (Horizontal).\n        *   **Right Edge (non-corner):** Project **Right** (Horizontal).\n        *   **Top-Left Corner:** Project **Up-Left** (Diagonal).\n        *   **Top-Right Corner:** Project **Up-Right** (Diagonal).\n        *   **Bottom-Left Corner:** Project **Down-Left** (Diagonal).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner:** Project **Down-Right** (Diagonal).\n    *   The ray consists of the core color $C$.\n    *   The ray starts at the Hole pixel itself (replacing it with $C$) and continues in the determined direction until it hits the grid edge.\n4.  **Collision Resolution:** If rays from different pods overlap at the same pixel:\n    *   The ray with the **shorter distance to its source** (the hole) takes precedence (Closer wins).\n    *   If distances are equal, a consistent tie-breaking rule applies (in this solution, Vertical lines or Reading Order of the pod seems to take precedence).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nWe identified 5 pods:\n1.  **Pod A (Yellow 4):** Rows 4-7, Cols 14-17.\n    *   Hole at (4,17) [TR] $\\to$ Ray Up-Right.\n    *   Hole at (5,17) [R] $\\to$ Ray Right.\n    *   Hole at (7,15) [B] $\\to$ Ray Down.\n2.  **Pod B (Red 2):** Rows 4-7, Cols 3-6.\n    *   Hole at (4,4) [T] $\\to$ Ray Up.\n    *   Hole at (5,3) [L] $\\to$ Ray Left.\n    *   Hole at (7,6) [BR] $\\to$ Ray Down-Right.\n3.  **Pod C (Pink 6):** Rows 13-16, Cols 22-25.\n    *   Hole at (13,23) [T] $\\to$ Ray Up.\n    *   Hole at (13,25) [TR] $\\to$ Ray Up-Right.\n    *   Hole at (16,25) [BR] $\\to$ Ray Down-Right.\n4.  **Pod D (Orange 7):** Rows 19-22, Cols 21-24.\n    *   Hole at (20,24) [R] $\\to$ Ray Right.\n    *   Hole at (22,24) [BR] $\\to$ Ray Down-Right.\n5.  **Pod E (Maroon 9):** Rows 24-27, Cols 0-3.\n    *   Hole at (24,2) [T] $\\to$ Ray Up.\n    *   Hole at (27,3) [BR] $\\to$ Ray Down-Right.\n\n**Notable Conflicts:**\n*   At `(5,2)`: Ray B (Left, dist 1) vs Ray E (Up, dist 19). Ray B wins (Color 2).\n*   At `(16,15)`: Ray A (Down, dist 9) vs Ray B (Down-Right, dist 9). Ray A wins (Color 4).\n*   At `(20,29)`: Ray C (Down-Right, dist 4) vs Ray D (Right, dist 5). Ray C wins (Color 6).\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8",

The line color matches the interior color of that pattern\n\nFor the test input, I identify these patterns and their gaps:\n- **2s pattern** (rows 4-7, cols 3-6): gaps at (4,4)\u2192up, (5,3)\u2192left, (7,6)\u2192diagonal down-right\n- **4s pattern** (rows 4-7, cols 14-17): gaps at (4,14)\u2192diagonal up-left, (5,17)\u2192right, (7,15)\u2192down\n- **6s pattern** (rows 13-16, cols 22-25): gaps at (13,23)\u2192up, (13,25)\u2192diagonal up-right, (16,25)\u2192diagonal down-right\n- **7s pattern** (rows 19-22, cols 21-24): gaps at (20,24)\u2192right, (22,24)\u2192diagonal down-right\n- **9s pattern** (rows 24-27, cols 0-3): gaps at (24,2)\u2192up, (27,3)\u2192diagonal down-right\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

In a given direction, if the **immediately adjacent** cell is background (`8`), then the source \u201cemits a ray\u201d in that direction.\n3. The ray continues step-by-step in that same direction, and every encountered background (`8`) cell is recolored to the source color.\n4. The ray stops if it goes out of bounds or hits a wall `3`.  \n   (Existing non-background cells are not overwritten.)\n\nApplying this to all sources produces the output.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n2,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,9,8,8,8\n8,2,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,9,8,8,8,8\n2,8,2,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,9,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,9,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,4,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,9,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,7,8\n8,8,9,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8\n8,8,9,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8\n8,8,9,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,7,8,8,6,8\n8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,4,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

On each framed object, some outline cells are **missing** (they are `8` instead of `3`).  \n   Each such missing outline cell is an **opening**.\n\n3. **From each opening**, the interior color \u201cescapes\u201d as a **beam**:\n   - Find the interior-colored cell that touches the opening (touching can be orthogonal or diagonal).\n   - The beam direction is the step from that interior cell into the opening (one of the 8 directions).\n   - The beam **paints every `8` cell it travels through** with the interior color, continuing step by step.\n\n4. **Beams do not overwrite non-background** (anything not `8`, including the original `3` frames and other colors).\n\n5. **When two beams would step into the same next cell at the same time**, they do not enter that cell.  \n   Instead, they both \u201cdeflect\u201d by updating their directions to the **sign of the sum** of their direction vectors (this produces the kind of diagonal diversion seen in Example 3), and they continue from their current positions.  \n   The contested cell remains `8`.\n\nApplying these rules to the test input yields the following output.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6  \n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8  \n2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8  \n8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8  \n9,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,9,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",
