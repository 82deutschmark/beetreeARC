        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Strategic Approach to the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's my game plan for tackling this ARC task. The goal is to figure out the hidden rules behind a transformation applied to a grid of numbers, based on examples and a test input. I'm going to break it down systematically:\n\n1.  **Understand the Basic Setup:** We're dealing with grids of numbers (0-9). The core task is to take an input grid and produce a transformed output grid. The main challenge is deciphering the logic behind this transformation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Examples:** The examples are crucial for inferring the rules. I will carefully examine each example, identifying key components like \"walls\" (contiguous lines of 9s) and \"boxes\" (regions bordered by 0s). I'll pay close attention to how these elements interact. What direction do objects move? How do contents change?\n\n3.  **Formulate Hypotheses:** Based on my observations, I'll generate hypotheses about the transformation rules. My initial thoughts are along the lines of \"gravity\" or \"attraction\" \u2013 perhaps boxes are drawn towards the walls and push the walls! I'll test these hypotheses against the examples to see if they hold up. The change of contents within the boxes is also a huge area of study. Is there something to the order of numbers? Do they conduct heat?\n\n4.  **Refine & Test:** If my initial hypotheses don't fully explain the behavior, I'll refine them. I'm open to considering alternative perspectives, like the idea of heat transfer or fluid dynamics (where the 9s act as hot sources), and see if this provides a more consistent explanation.\n\n5.  **Test Input is the Key:** The test input will be the ultimate validation tool. I'll apply my refined rules to the test input and see if they produce the expected output. If they don't, I'll go back to the drawing board and modify the rules until I can consistently predict the transformation.\n\n6.  **Code the Solution:** After establishing consistent rules, I'll construct the rules as explicitly as possible to transform the grid.\n\n**Example-Driven Rule Discovery:**\n\n*   **Movement:** I initially suspected boxes were sliding towards walls, but sometimes walls moved too. Now, my hypothesis is that boxes (bordered by 0s) move to minimize the gap to the 9s. I'm carefully analyzing how many steps this move entails.\n*   **Content Changes:** I noticed a pattern where numbers inside boxes would change. \"7s\" seem to \"heat up\" boxes. It looks as though if a \"5\" (Grey) touches a wall or another 7, it'll convert to a 7.\n*   **Directionality:** The direction of movement is critical. Box positions were linked to wall positions in different ways.\n\n**Test Input Strategy:**\n\nThe test input has provided three vertical strips that I will use to see if the rules are generalizable.\n\n1.  *Left Strip:* Wall on top, Box underneath, all Grey, Orange, and Green.\n2.  *Middle Strip:* Box on top, Wall below it, all Grey.\n3.  *Right Strip:* Box on top with Orange, Wall below it.\n\nI'll check the movement direction of each box (Up, Down, and Down), and how the conversion from Grey to Orange takes place. I need to be exact here. Based on this, I plan to code up the transformation. I have been very careful when making calculations, and believe a general solution will emerge!\n\n\nTo solve this task, I have analyzed the transformation rules from the three solved examples and applied them to the test input.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The grid contains \"Walls\" (lines of `9`s) and \"Boxes\" (rectangular areas enclosed by `0`s). Inside the boxes, the pixels are either `5` (grey) or `7` (orange).\n2.  **Movement Rule**: Boxes move towards the nearest adjacent Wall.\n    *   If a box is separated from a wall by a gap, it moves to close the gap and **overlaps** the wall by one unit (or moves to maximize contact).\n    *   **Left Strip**: The box is below the wall. It moves **UP** by 1 row (overwriting the bottom row of the wall).\n    *   **Middle Strip**: The box is above the wall, separated by a gap of 1 row. It moves **DOWN** by 2 rows (closing the gap and overwriting the wall).\n    *   **Right Strip**: The box is above the wall and touching it. It moves **DOWN** by 1 row (overwriting the wall).\n3.  **Color Transformation (Heat Diffusion)**:\n    *   The Walls (`9`s) act as a \"heat source\". `7` is \"hot\" and `5` is \"cold\".\n    *   When a box touches/overlaps a wall, the \"heat\" (`7`) spreads from the wall into the box.\n    *   Existing `7`s inside the box also help propagate the heat to adjacent `5`s.\n    *   **Left Box**: Moving up brings the content closer to the top wall. The top-most layer of `5`s (specifically those adjacent to existing `7`s) turns into `7`s. The row that was `7,7,7,7,5` becomes `7,7,7,7,7`.\n    *   **Middle Box**: Moving down brings the content to the bottom wall. The bottom-most layer of content (`5,5,7`) becomes fully hot (`7,7,7`). The heat propagates up slightly: the row above (`5,5,5`) catches some heat from the `7` below it, becoming `5,5,7`.\n    *   **Right Box**: Content is already fully `7`s. It remains `7`s.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Left Column (Cols 1-8)**:\n    *   Input Box (Rows 13-23) moves UP to Rows 12-22.\n    *   Content shifts up. The `5` in the mixed row (originally Row 16) turns into a `7`.\n*   **Middle Column (Cols 11-15)**:\n    *   Input Box (Rows 0-7) moves DOWN 2 rows to Rows 2-9.\n    *   Content shifts down. The bottom row (originally `5,5,7`) becomes `7,7,7`. The row above it (`5,5,5`) becomes `5,5,7`.\n*   **Right Column (Cols 22-25)**:\n    *   Input Box (Rows 0-13) moves DOWN 1 row to Rows 1-14.\n    *   Content remains `7`s.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Deconstructing the ARC Puzzle**\n\nOkay, here we go. I'm faced with this ARC problem. It seems like the core is about moving these \"Boxes\" around and changing the colors inside them, influenced by these \"Maroon\" structures.\n\n**Initial Impressions:**\n\n*   It starts with these three examples and a test case.\n*   I\u2019m seeing a pattern with how these \"Maroon\" (9) elements interact with the \"Boxes\" (0-framed elements). The \"Maroon\" elements seem to be directional indicators: Boxes move towards them.\n*   The \"Grey\" (5) pixels inside a Box change to \"Orange\" (7) pixels under the influence of these movements.\n\n**Digging into Example 1:**\n\n1.  I started by closely analyzing the pixel values and grid positions, mapping them to objects within. I identified:\n    *   **Maroon**: These are the \"direction vectors\" for the \"Box\".\n    *   **Boxes**: 0-frame elements containing Grey and Orange pixels.\n    *   **Grid Structure:** Mapping all cells within the grid to their respective objects, pixel values, and grid coordinates.\n2.  I noticed the Boxes move up in the example, and somehow \"eat\" the \"Maroon\" block above, changing the internal color.\n\n3.  The core question becomes, *where do the colors come from?*\n    *   I did a comparison of input vs output pixel counts and identified the rule.\n    *   A lot of focus on pixel counts did not result in a consistent rule.\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation**\n\n*   **Initial Hypothesis**: Maybe the \"Maroon\" acts like \"paint\" flowing into the Box? The movement triggers a pixel-level change.\n\n**Refinement through Example Analysis**\n\n*   Analyzing Example 2, the interaction is not limited to vertical blocks. Horizontal, diagonal, sideways - everything gets covered.\n*   I noticed movement, but the \"Maroon\" moved too. So it\u2019s not stationary. The goal is to move the Box. The Maroon is an indicator. If it's next to the Box, the Box moves into it.\n*   This led to a new hypothesis:\n\n    *   **Movement Rule**: Boxes move towards the Maroon in the appropriate direction. They move until they hit another Maroon line or the edge of the grid.\n    *   **Color Conversion**: When a box \"moves over\", meaning overlays or touches a Maroon structure, that\u2019s when pixels inside change (5 -> 7).\n\n*   I went back to examples trying to predict the direction of movement.\n\n**Refining the Color Change Rule**\n\n1.  This, along with the \"Distance Moved\" concept, finally made sense. I had to focus on:\n    *   Identify how many Maroon pixels are \"covered.\"\n    *   Map them into the Box.\n    *   Figure out the logic behind conversion.\n2.  I introduced the concept of **\"Fill = Distance.\"**\n3.  *Ex 3 gave a clue.* The new 7s always build towards the Maroon.\n\n**Pattern Emerges**\n\n1.  **Boxes move toward Maroon lines.**\n2.  **The interior of the Box where it passed over the original Maroon becomes 7**.\n\n**Test Input**\n\n*   The test input has the Box \"touching\" Maroon, which might imply one more move (overlap?) and, thus, more new pixels.\n*   I worked out the details with the help of this new model.\n*   I created the logic.\n\n**Summarizing:**\n\n1.  **Directional Movement**: Boxes are attracted to the Maroon, moving toward them, and the direction is based on the Maroon location relative to the Box.\n2.  **Overlapping is the Key:**. If the Box moves over, the leading interior rows are changed (5 -> 7).\n3.  **Fill Amount Calculation**: The fill amount is equal to the distance the Box moved.\n4.  I used the patterns observed to predict how the test case grids should transform, making sure to show how all the elements (Maroons, Boxes) would interact with the movements.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the interplay between the geometric arrangement, the movement, and the fill based on the distance. I can move on now to code and build the algorithm based on these observations.\n\n\nThe solution involves simulating the movement of \"Box\" objects (defined by 0-borders containing 5s and 7s) based on the attraction of \"Maroon\" objects (lines or blocks of 9s).\n\n**Rules derived from examples:**\n1.  **Movement:** Each Box moves in the direction of the nearest Maroon block/line.\n    *   **Box 1 (Top Right):** Maroon is below (Row 8). Box moves **Down**.\n    *   **Box 2 (Bottom Left):** Maroon is to the right (Col 17). Box moves **Right**.\n    *   **Box 3 (Bottom Right):** Maroon is above (Row 16). Box moves **Up**.\n2.  **Distance:** Boxes move until they touch or overlap the Maroon object, or touch another object that is blocked by the Maroon object.\n    *   **Box 1:** Moves down 1 step to overlap the Maroon line at Row 8. (New position: Rows 1-8).\n    *   **Box 2:** Moves right 9 steps to touch the Maroon block at Col 17. (New position: Cols 10-16).\n    *   **Box 3:** Moves up 2 steps to touch the Maroon block at Row 16. (New position: Rows 17-23).\n3.  **Interior Change (5s to 7s):** When a box moves, pixels inside change from Grey (5) to Orange (7) based on the **distance moved**. The \"fill\" starts from the **leading edge** (the side facing the movement direction) and extends inwards.\n    *   **Box 1:** Moved 1 step. The bottom row of the interior is the leading edge. It fills 1 pixel depth. Since the bottom row already has a 7 on the right (`5,5,7`), the fill connects to it, resulting in `5,7,7`.\n    *   **Box 2:** Moved 9 steps. The right column of the interior is the leading edge. It fills 9 pixels. The column height is 8, so the entire rightmost column of the interior becomes 7s. The 9th pixel spills to the next column (top pixel), which is already a 7. Result: Rightmost column becomes all 7s.\n    *   **Box 3:** Moved 2 steps. The top row of the interior is the leading edge. It fills 2 pixels depth. The interior values were vertically `5, 7, 7, 5, 5`. The top two pixels (`5, 7`) become `7, 7`. The resulting column is `7, 7, 7, 5, 5`.\n\n**Grid Construction:**\n*   **Background:** 6s.\n*   **Box 1:** Rows 1-8, Cols 11-15.\n    *   Border: 0s.\n    *   Interior (R2-7, C12-14):\n        *   Rows 2-6: `5, 5, 5`\n        *   Row 7: `5, 7, 7`\n*   **Box 2:** Rows 14-23, Cols 10-16.\n    *   Border: 0s.\n    *   Interior (R15-22, C11-15):\n        *   Row 15 (Top): `7, 7, 7, 7, 7`\n        *   Rows 16-22: `5, 5, 5, 5, 7` (Rightmost column filled).\n*   **Box 3:** Rows 17-23, Cols 17-19.\n    *   Border: 0s.\n    *   Interior (R18-22, C18):\n        *   Values: `7, 7, 7, 5, 5` (Vertical column).\n*   **Remaining Maroon (9s):**\n    *   The Maroon line at R8 is overwritten by Box 1.\n    *   The Maroon block at C17-19 (Rows 14-16) remains above Box 3.\n    *   The Maroon block at C17-19 (Rows 17-23) is overwritten by Box 3.\n    *   The Maroon block at the far right (C22-25) remains.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,6,6,9,9,9,9\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,0,5,5,5,5,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,5,0,6,6,0,5,5,5,5,7,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,0,5,5,5,5,7,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,0,5,5,5,5,7,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,0,5,5,5,5,7,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,0,5,5,5,5,7,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,0,5,5,5,5,7,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,0,5,5,5,5,7,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9",

Let the shift distance be the number of cells between the adjacent (moving) 9-bar and that next (target) 9-bar.\n5. **Move the entire 0-framed rectangle** by that distance in that direction.\n   - The old frame position becomes background **6**.\n   - The adjacent 9-bar is considered to have slid and merged into the target, so it disappears from its old location (often it is overwritten anyway).\n6. **Recoloring rule (inside the moved frame only):**\n   - Convert exactly `|shift|` cells of color **5** into **7** (or all of them if there are fewer than `|shift|`).\n   - Which 5s get converted is determined by a direction-dependent scan order:\n     - **Up:** scan interior from **top-left**, row-major (left\u2192right, top\u2192bottom).\n     - **Down:** scan interior from **bottom-right**, row-major reversed (right\u2192left, bottom\u2192top).\n     - **Right:** scan interior from **top-right**, column-major (top\u2192bottom, right\u2192left).\n     - **Left:** scan interior from **bottom-left**, column-major (bottom\u2192top, left\u2192right).\n\nApplying this to the test grid moves four framed rectangles and updates their interiors accordingly, producing the output below.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,7,7,7,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0  \n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9",
