            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this ARC task and how I'm thinking about it.**\n\nThe user wants me to crack this ARC problem based on a few input-output examples. My goal is to figure out the underlying logic and apply it to a new test case. Here's how my brain is working through it:\n\n*   **Initial Scan & Hypothesis:** I'm starting by carefully observing the examples. My first thought is usually to see if there's an obvious pattern like a color swap or a simple geometric transformation. I\u2019m looking for relationships between input colors, the spatial arrangement of those colors, and how that influences the output.\n\n*   **Example 1: The \"Seed\" Idea:** I noticed the first example has colors like \"1\", \"2\", and \"8\". The output only has \"2\", and the pattern of the output kind of mirrors the arrangement of \"1\" in the input, possibly shifted or somehow related to that original shape. This makes me consider if there is a primary color (maybe \"2\" is dominant) that acts as a \"fill\" and an associated shape defined by the pixels of \"1\" or \"8\" \u2013 a \u201ctemplate.\u201d\n\n*   **Example 4: Line Swaps:** Example 4's a simpler grid, and here's where things start to sharpen. It has lines (horizontal of \"1\"s, vertical of \"2\"s). The output cleanly *swaps* the colors of these lines. I think \"Aha! This might be it!\" Then my brain starts searching for the evidence to prove that this rule applies to all the examples.\n\n*   **The \"Most Common Color\" or \"Least Common Color\" Red Herring:** I wonder if the most common color (or maybe least common) gets swapped, then realize it does not apply well to every example. I try to map the output colors to the input pixel count and look for the relation. This line of thought leads nowhere, so I pivot.\n\n*   **The \"Marker\" and the \"Structure\"**: Next, I started thinking about \"structures\" (like lines or patterns) and \"markers\" (single pixels or small groups of pixels). Maybe the \"marker\" defines *what* happens to the structure. Example 3 has different patterns and the most frequent colors, so maybe there are regions of \"4\", or \"1\" and other sparse pixels.\n\n*   **Region Recognition:** I am looking for the \"lines\" like in example 4 but my brain goes for the rectangle and other shapes created by color regions.\n\n*   **Combining Hypothesis (Marker + Structure + Shape Transformation)**: This is the core hypothesis forming:\n    1.  **Identify Structures:** Large groups of pixels of the same color.\n    2.  **Identify Markers:** Single pixels or small groups of pixels.\n    3.  **Map:** Relate a Marker Color to a Structure Color, maybe based on proximity or the \u201cbounding box\u201d\n    4.  **Transform:** The output shape (the pixel pattern) relates to the structure and it changes to the pattern defined by the marker. Maybe the structure *defines a shape* (boundary) and the output *fills* that shape. And the color is influenced by the marker.\n\n*   **Example 3 and Pattern Replication:** In Example 3, I'm stuck, but then I remember that the output sometimes forms a pattern like the output of the \"1\" pixels from the input, maybe the \"marker\" color (a single pixel) from the input is determining the pattern (like checkerboard or diagonal lines) that should be copied or replicated at the output.\n\n*   **Connected Component Idea:** I consider how many pixels are connected by the same color, large lines (like Example 4) or isolated pixels. This seems like a good line to try. The connected components *might* be what drives the final pixel value.\n\n*   **Let\u2019s Test the Hypothesis for The Test Input**: This is the heart of the task!\n    1.  **Grid Analysis:** My brain starts scanning the new 20x20 test input for any lines, shapes, \"keys\" (color swaps), or things that might look like markers or structures. I identify the \u201c8\u201ds as clear structural elements. 8 is the separator.\n    2.  **The \"Key\" to the Puzzle**: I see what looks like a pattern: `4 1 8` and `2 4 8` on the test input. In other words, a group of pixels with some key, a pixel, and the `8`. My hypothesis is: the key tells me how to map a color to a value.\n    3.  **The \u201cWall\u201d or Separator:** I notice this pattern of lines + 8 is in the left side of the input. I decide to see if it makes\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Separation of Logic and Data:**\n    *   In Example 2, Row 10 contains `8 0 4 2...`. This acts as a key: `4` and `2` are related (swapped/mapped). The regions with 4s and 2s in the grid are transformed accordingly.\n    *   In Example 4, a swap between colors 1 and 2 occurs (lines change color). Isolated pixels of 1 and 2 (\"noise\") hint at this relationship.\n    *   The test input contains a specific structure in the top-left area (Rows 0-11, Cols 0-4). There is a vertical dashed line of `8`s at columns 3 and 4. To the left of these `8`s, we see pairs of colors:\n        *   Row 2: `0 4 1 8`. This indicates a mapping `4 -> 1`.\n        *   Row 6: `0 2 4 8`. This indicates a mapping `2 -> 4`.\n        *   Row 10: `0 5 7 8 8`. This indicates a mapping `5 -> 7`.\n\n2.  **Instruction Zone vs. Canvas:**\n    *   The area containing the instructions (Rows 0-11, columns 0-4) acts as a \"legend\" or \"instruction set\" and is not part of the image content. These pixels, including the separator `8`s, should be removed (become 0) in the output.\n    *   The rest of the grid (and rows below 11) is the \"Canvas\". The pixels here are retained but transformed according to the rules derived from the instructions.\n\n3.  **Determining the Transformation Rules:**\n    *   From the instruction rows, we have:\n        *   `4` becomes `1`.\n        *   `2` becomes `4`.\n        *   `5` becomes `7`.\n    *   We must deduce the mapping for color `1`, which appears in the canvas at `(2,10)`.\n        *   We have `2 -> 4` and `4 -> 1`. This suggests a chain or cycle.\n        *   In ARC tasks, transformations are often permutations (cycles) rather than many-to-one mappings. If `1` mapped to `1`, then both `4` and `1` would result in `1` (loss of distinction). If `1` mapped to `4`, it would conflict with `2` mapping to `4`.\n        *   The most logical completion of the chain `2 -> 4 -> 1` is a cycle: `1 -> 2`. This creates a permutation `(1 2 4)` where colors rotate `1->2`, `2->4`, `4->1`.\n    *   Color `6` appears in the canvas but is not in the instructions. In Example 2, some colors remained unchanged. We assume `6 -> 6`.\n\n4.  **Applying the Transformation:**\n    *   **Filter:** Clear all pixels in the instruction zone (Rows 0-11, Cols 0-4) and all separator `8`s.\n    *   **Map:** Apply the rules to all remaining pixels:\n        *   `2 -> 4`\n        *   `4 -> 1`\n        *   `5 -> 7`\n        *   `1 -> 2`\n        *   `6 -> 6` (Unchanged)\n\n**Processing the Test Input:**\n*   **Instruction Removal:**\n    *   Remove `(1,0)` [Color 2], `(1,3)` [8].\n    *   Remove Row 2 `4, 1, 8`.\n    *   Remove Row 6 `2, 4, 8`.\n    *   Remove Row 10 `5, 7, 8, 8`.\n    *   Remove vertical line of `8`s at `(x,3)` and `(x,4)`.\n*   **Canvas Transformation:**\n    *   Row 0: `(0,17)` is 6 -> **6**.\n    *   Row 1: `(1,7)` is 6 -> **6**, `(1,19)` is 6 -> **6**.\n    *   Row 2: `(2,10)` is 1 -> **2**.\n    *   Row 3: `(3,13)` is 5 -> **7**.\n    *   Row 6: `(6,11)` is 2 -> **4**.\n    *   Row 8: `(8,18)` is 5 -> **7**.\n    *   Row 9: `(9,13)` is 4 -> **1**.\n    *   Row 10: `(10,9)` is 5 -> **7**.\n    *   Row 12: `(12,16)` is 2 -> **4**.\n    *   Row 14: `(14,1)` is 2 -> **4**, `(14,5)` is 2 -> **4**, `(14,13)` is 2 -> **4**, `(14,19)` is 6 -> **6**.\n    *   Row 15: `(15,9)` is 4 -> **1**.\n    *   Row 16: `(16,2)` is 5 -> **7**.\n    *   Row 17: `(17,13)` is 4 -> **1**, `(17,16)` is 6 -> **6**.\n    *   Row 19: `(19,0)` is 5 -> **7**, `(19,9)` is 6 -> **6**.\n\nThe final grid is constructed with these transformed pixels.\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the solved examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1. **Example 1**: First row contains `1,2,8,8,8` - a \"key\" showing source color (1), target color (2), and 8s as markers. The 1s in the body are replaced with 2s.\n\n2. **Example 4**: Two crossing lines (1s horizontal, 2s vertical) swap colors. Noise (8s and scattered elements) is removed.\n\n3. **Examples 2 & 3**: More complex - 8s form diamond structures, with nearby color pairs indicating mappings. Patterns are transformed accordingly.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nThe 8s form a vertical structure around columns 3-5, rows 1-11. Adjacent to this structure are color pairs that define mappings:\n- Row 2: 4, 1 \u2192 mapping 4 \u2192 1\n- Row 6: 2, 4 \u2192 mapping 2 \u2192 4  \n- Row 10: 5, 7 \u2192 mapping 5 \u2192 7\n\n**Transformation Rules:**\n1. Apply color mappings: 4\u21921, 2\u21924, 5\u21927\n2. Reverse mappings for existing colors: 1\u21924, 7\u21925\n3. Remove all 8s (become 0)\n4. Remove key-area colors adjacent to 8 structure (become 0)\n5. Remove 6s (no mapping defined, treated as noise)\n\nApplying these rules systematically to each cell in the test input:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Color Transformation Based on Adjacent Patterns**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I need to figure out how to transform a grid of colors. It looks like there are a few core concepts at play: specific colors act as \"keys\" that define how other colors should be replaced, and there's a consistent pattern involving the removal of certain elements and the application of a \"fill\" or \"swap\" operation.\n\nInitially, I looked at this as a shape-matching task, and at first I thought this was just about taking one color and turning it into something else. The thing that threw me off was these extra colors that didn't do anything, the \"noise\" or \"delimiters\" as I started calling them. I kept coming back to one color being the \"key\"\n\nThen I started looking for a consistent element - color 8 - it was always there, and always gone. From then on, I was more clear that the \"key\" was color 8. I realized I could ignore or even treat 8 as background to make it easier.\n\nFocusing on the patterns of non-noise colors, I noticed the examples had things adjacent to the \"8s\". Then it clicked! There's a 3-part rule:\n\n1.  **Find Adjacency:** Identify sequences of three adjacent pixels: [Color A, Color B, Color 8], this is the KEY.\n2.  **Transformation Rule:** The key defines a transformation rule, Color A becomes Color B (A->B).\n3.  **Application:** In the output grid, anywhere there was a pixel of Color A, it becomes Color B.\n4.  **Key Pixel & Noise Removal:** Remove any occurrences of Color 8, and the Key Pixels themselves (both Color A, and Color B).\n\nThere are two major nuances: 1) What color should be chosen for the fill (based on adjacent pixels)? 2) Are all the rules simultaneous, or does the fact that I find a 4->1 and a 2->4 rule mean there's a transitive relationship (2 is ultimately a 1)? My logic says they are simultaneous. The \"Key Pixels\" which are adjacent to the deliminator, are erased, making the rule consistent.\n\nThe test examples let me create a grid of rules. It seems that this covers most of the cases.\n\n\nThe transformation rule is inferred as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify \"Noise\" and \"Key\" structures**: The color 8 acts as a delimiter or control symbol. It is consistently removed in the output.\n2.  **Decode Transformation Keys**: Locate all linear sequences of three horizontally adjacent pixels `[A, B, 8]` (or `[8, B, A]`), where `A`, `B`, and `8` are distinct colors.\n    *   Such a sequence defines a transformation rule: **Color A changes to Color B**.\n    *   The pixels `A` and `B` forming this specific key sequence are treated as \"instruction code\" and are removed (set to 0) in the output, along with the 8.\n3.  **Apply Transformations**: For all other pixels in the grid (those not part of a key sequence or an 8):\n    *   If a pixel's color matches `A` from a discovered rule `A -> B`, change it to `B`.\n    *   If a pixel's color does not match any source color `A`, it remains unchanged.\n    *   The transformations are simultaneous.\n4.  **Cleanup**: Ensure all 8s are removed.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Key Detection**:\n    *   Row 2: Sequence `4, 1, 8` at indices `(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)`. Rule: **4 -> 1**. Key pixels at `(2,1), (2,2)` become 0. `(2,3)` (8) becomes 0.\n    *   Row 6: Sequence `2, 4, 8` at indices `(6,1), (6,2), (6,3)`. Rule: **2 -> 4**.

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Finalized Approach: A Refined \"Paint-By-Numbers\" Logic**\n\nAlright, here's what I've figured out for this ARC problem. It seems like the core idea is a \"paint-by-numbers\" approach. We identify \"Shapes\" and \"Markers\" within the input, then \"paint\" the shapes with the colors of the markers.\n\n1.  **Shape identification**: Find connected structures of a single color. Think of solid or dashed lines, or recognizable shapes.\n\n2.  **Marker identification**:  Find pixels of a different color, often near the shape. The proximity is crucial; these are our \"paint buckets.\"\n\n3.  **Mapping and \"Painting\"**: Each identified shape is \"filled\" or repainted with the color of its closest marker. Simple, right? But the devil's in the details of determining what constitutes a shape and what constitutes a marker. The \"noise\" pixels usually serve as the \"marker\" pixels and the well defined pixels as \"shapes\".\n\nExample: If an outline is identified and the closest \"marker\" is color 2, the defined outline is filled. Any \"unlinked\" pixels just disappear.\n\nLet's look at it like this:\n\n*   **Shapes**: Distinct visual elements, like lines, or closed figures.\n*   **Markers**: Pixels that are associated with a Shape, but are not actually part of the shape. If a shape has a marker of a specific color, all pixels making up that shape are changed to that color.\n*   **Transformation**: The Shapes take the color of the \"Marker\". This is how the input is transformed.\n*   **Noise**: Unorganized pixels that are removed.\n\nNow, applying this framework to the **Test Input** I'm trying to solve.\n\n1.  **Shape Identification:**\n    *   **Left Vertical Bar (8s):** Appears at cols 3-4 (rows 1-11). There are the 8s to define a structure.\n    *   **Right structure (6s)**: It seems to form a structure (cols 17-18). It's vertical. It spans all rows.\n    *   **Bottom Line (2s)**: Row 14. This is a horizontal bar of pixels.\n    *   **Top** - A red pixel, which is the starting marker for the top\n\n2.  **Marker Identification:**\n    *   **Left Vertical Bar**: (1, 4, 7): This should have markers that represent it in the output. The markers are (2,2)=1, (6,2)=4, (10,2)=7.\n    *   **Right Structure**: Near the 6, (5,17)=4. So marker will be 4.\n    *   **Bottom Line**: The marker is scattered. (16,2), (19,0), should be 5.\n    *   **Top?** (1,0)=2. This is the seed. Top goes to red color 2.\n\n3.  **Application to Output**: Let's build what the grid will look like.\n    *   Left Vertical Bar : Split it into sections of 1, 4, and 7.\n        *   Rows 1-4: 1\n        *   Rows 5-8: 4\n        *   Rows 9-12: 7\n        *   Rows 13-19: Should the 7 keep going? No, because it is far. (What's the output of the 13-19 block?). It's outside of the bar, so it's a 0.\n    *   Right Vertical Bar: Fill with 4.\n    *   Bottom Horizontal: Fill with 5.\n    *   Top Horizontal: Fill with 2.\n\n**Final Grid Output** will look like a set of connected filled bars of specific colors. The intersection should be handled in a way that, if there are multiple values it should choose the \"closer\" or \"stronger\" marker, meaning the one closer to the line has the stronger property. The horizontal 2 should become vertical 2 and the vertical 8 becomes 4.\n\nI need to create a solution based on this. I just have to create a set of loops to do this in order!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on patterns inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** A sparse set of blue pixels (1) outlines a region. A single red pixel (2) acts as a \"marker\" or \"seed\". The output creates a solid red shape filling the region defined by the blue pixels. The teal pixels (8) are ignored.\n    *   **Rule:** Shape Outline + Marker -> Filled Shape of Marker Color.\n2.  **Example 2:** A frame of magenta (6), red (2), yellow (4), and orange (7) pixels defines a region. The output is a thick frame with checkerboard patterns. The colors map: Top (6) -> 7, Left (2) -> 4, Right (4) -> 2.\n    *   **Rule:** Sides of the frame swap/map colors based on \"markers\" or specific swap pairs (2<->4, 6<->7).\n3.  **Example 3:** Shapes of yellow (4) and blue (1) are replaced by filled shapes of red (2) and orange (7). There are red and orange pixels in the input acting as markers (though sparse).\n    *   **Rule:** Outline Color -> Marker Color.\n4.  **Example 4:** A horizontal line of blue (1) and a vertical line of red (2) cross. In the output, the blue line becomes red, and the red line becomes blue.\n    *   **Rule:** Intersecting/nearby shapes swap/take each other's colors.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Object 1 (Left Vertical):** There is a vertical broken line of teal (8) pixels in columns 3 and 4, spanning approximately rows 1 to 12.\n    *   **Markers:** To the immediate left (col 2) of this line, there are distinct pixels aligned with different sections:\n        *   Row 2, Col 2 is Blue (1).\n        *   Row 6, Col 2 is Yellow (4).\n        *   Row 10, Col 2 is Orange (7).\n    *   **Transformation:** The teal line transforms into a vertical bar with three colored segments corresponding to the markers:\n        *   Top section (approx rows 1-4) becomes **Blue (1)**.\n        *   Middle section (approx rows 5-8) becomes **Yellow (4)**.\n        *   Bottom section (approx rows 9-12) becomes **Orange (7)**.\n\n*   **Object 2 (Right Vertical):** There is a sparse vertical structure of magenta (6) pixels on the right side (around col 17-19).\n    *   **Markers:** There are several yellow (4) pixels scattered on the right side (e.g., (5,17), (9,13), (15,9), (17,13)).\n    *   **Transformation:** This right-side structure becomes a solid vertical bar of **Yellow (4)**.\n\n*   **Object 3 (Bottom Horizontal):** There is a horizontal line of red (2) pixels on row 14.\n    *   **Markers:** There are several grey (5) pixels scattered near the bottom (e.g., (16,2), (19,0)).\n    *   **Transformation:** The horizontal line becomes a solid bar of **Grey (5)**.\n\n*   **Object 4 (Top Horizontal):** There is a line on row 1 containing red (2), teal (8), and magenta (6). The pixel at (1,0) is Red (2).\n    *   **Transformation:** This defines a top horizontal bar. Given the red pixel at the start, it likely becomes **Red (2)**.\n\n**Priority/Layering:**\nIn Example 4, the vertical line overwrote the horizontal line at the intersection. We will assume the vertical bars (Left and Right) are drawn \"on top\" of the horizontal bars (Top and Bottom).\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid:**\n*   **Background:** Black (0).\n*   **Top Bar:** Row 1 filled with Red (2).\n*   **Bottom Bar:** Row 14 filled with Grey (5).\n*   **Left Bar:** Columns 3 and 4.\n    *   Rows 1-4: Blue (1).\n    *   Rows 5-8: Yellow (4).\n    *   Rows 9-12: Orange (7).\n*   **Right Bar:** Columns 17 and 18 filled with Yellow (4). (Assuming width 2 to match the Left Bar).\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n2,2,2,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,2\n0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0\n\nRefining based on standard ARC geometric integrity:\nThe Left Bar seems to span rows 1-12.\nThe Bottom Bar is at row 14.\nThe Top Bar is at row 1.\nThe Right Bar likely spans the whole height or matches the markers.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this ARC task.**\n\nThe goal is to analyze a set of input grids (essentially images with colored pixels) and produce a corresponding output grid, using patterns and relationships I can deduce from the examples.\n\nI started by observing that these problems often involve filling or pattern generation. I'll need to figure out what controls the filling \u2013 a seed color, a boundary, or something else. I'm focusing on identifying what part of the input controls what changes in the output.\n\nExample 1 made me think about boundaries. The blue pixels seem to enclose a region and it feels like a 'flood-fill' concept to me. It's almost like the pixels in the input define shapes. In this first example, it looks like a \"container\" shape (blue) and the \"contained\" space takes on a new color in the output, along with the boundary itself.\n\nMoving to Example 4, I see a clear color swap. This is a bit simpler, with isolated shapes swapping colours. A vertical block of one colour becomes the other, and vice versa. It seems a color in the shape is a seed.\n\nExample 2 is trickier. There are borders and a central object, and the outputs are also framed.  I noticed that the borders had specific patterns of colours. This example is about a colour swap between opposite sides of the outer border. In the output the opposite sides of the outer frame swap their border colors. It seems a shape within the frame tells the borders to swap colours. I think the interior structure's color might govern the color swap.\n\nExample 3 is more about scattered shapes. It has a central structure and also hints of color mapping. The central element might define colour mappings based on position. I was finding clues for relationships between colours based on their location, which is a key concept here, it turns out.\n\nAs I try to connect the patterns, I start to notice 8 is a special colour. In all examples so far, it acts like an 'instruction' that causes another pattern shift, and it disappears in the outputs, too. So my hypothesis shifts - I have a color \"trigger\" - color 8 that means the application of instructions. Other colours are shapes or fill patterns.\n\nNow I am convinced, color 8 serves as metadata or instruction. When I find 8, I need to interpret. The other colours are shapes that can be filled, swapped, or changed. This becomes a pattern where there's a key in the form of a colour sequence at the start of a row or column which triggers changes in the pattern. I think the presence of the special color dictates a change that happens.  The patterns are linked through instruction pixels (8) and a color mapping.\n\nLet's look at the Test input.\n\nThe test grid has multiple colors and several sequences with '8'. I've figured out what these sequences with 8 do - they are the Keys to map colors to each other - these sequences are color pairs that will swap to each other.\nI've discovered these rules: \n*   A sequence `4, 1, 8` suggests the pair `4 <-> 1`.\n*   A sequence `2, 4, 8` suggests the pair `2 <-> 4`.\n*   A sequence `5, 7, 8` suggests the pair `5 <-> 7`.\n\nI'm thinking about the shape and color of these input elements.\n\nIt appears the 8s become a \"Tree\" or \"Totem Pole\". Based on location, I believe the instruction zones are vertical sections on the left of this test input grid.  I need to use these for the colour mapping of the patterns. This \"Totem\" shape of 8s defines the \"instructions\". The 8s themselves vanish, the shapes remain. The instructions are local, but they dictate changes across the grid.\n\nThese instructions are about taking specific colors and making the pixel pattern of the grid change. It's looking like \"replace Color A with Color B\", according to a rule based on what colours are grouped with colour 8. \n\nThe task boils down to applying the color mapping and completing the shapes - which I think will be vertical bars formed by connecting \"dots\".\n\nSo, let's process the input grid to obtain the output:\n\n1.  **Extract the color mapping from the instruction clusters/Totem**: The instruction sequences: `4, 1, 8`, `2, 4, 8`, `5, 7, 8` imply that color 4 transforms to 1, color 2 transforms to 4 and color 5 transforms to 7.\n2.  **Identify the pixels that are shapes:** These are pixel patterns that are not color 8. I will look at pixels to the right of the instruction structure (to the right of column \n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** A boundary of blue (1) pixels encloses a region. Inside/nearby is a red (2) pixel. A row of `1, 2, 8` suggests a rule. The output is the region filled with red (2). The `8`s and the original `1`s disappear/transform.\n2.  **Example 2:** A frame of colored dots (6, 2, 7, 4) encloses a complex \"cross\" shape containing `8`s and pairs of colors. The output creates a thick border where colors are swapped: Top (6) <-> Bottom (7), Left (2) <-> Right (4). The pairs `6,7` and `2,4` can be found in the central cross.\n3.  **Example 3:** Sparse corners of dots (Yellow 4, Blue 1). A central diamond of `8`s contains a pair `4` and `2`. Output shows Yellow (4) shapes became Red (2) filled triangles. Bottom-left Blue (1) shape became Orange (7) filled triangle. A `7` is present in a cluster of `8`s.\n4.  **Example 4:** A block of `1`s and a line of `2`s. A sequence `2, 1, 8` is present. Output swaps the colors: `1`s become `2`s, `2`s become `1`s.\n\n**General Rule:**\n*   **Instruction Zones:** Pixels of color **8 (Teal)** define instruction areas.\n*   **Mappings:** Sequences of colors adjacent to or inside `8`-clusters define transformations (e.g., `A, B, 8` implies `A` maps to `B`).\n*   **Filling:** Sparse arrangements of pixels (dots) in the input define shapes (like vertical lines or corners) that are filled in the output.\n*   **Cleanup:** The instruction zones (8s and their key pixels) are removed from the output.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Mappings:**\n    *   Row 2 contains the sequence `0, 4, 1, 8`. This defines a mapping **4 (Yellow) -> 1 (Blue)**.\n    *   Row 6 contains the sequence `0, 2, 4, 8`. This defines a mapping **2 (Red) -> 4 (Yellow)**.\n    *   Row 10 contains the sequence `0, 5, 7, 8`. This defines a mapping **5 (Grey) -> 7 (Orange)**.\n    *   Colors not in the \"source\" position of a mapping (like 1 and 6) remain unchanged or map to themselves. (1 is a target, 6 is unused). So **1 -> 1**, **6 -> 6**.\n\n2.  **Identify Shapes to Fill:**\n    *   The \"instructions\" are on the left side (columns 0-8). The \"content\" to be transformed is on the right side (columns 9-19).\n    *   The content consists of sparse pixels arranged in columns. Following the \"Totem/Rain\" pattern, these pixels act as starting points for vertical bars.\n    *   **Filling Rule:** For each column, start at a dot, apply the color transformation, and fill downwards until the next dot or the bottom of the grid.\n\n3.  **Process Content Columns:**\n    *   **Column 9:**\n        *   (10,9) is 5. Map 5->7. Fill 7 from row 10 to 14.\n        *   (15,9) is 4. Map 4->1. Fill 1 from row 15 to 18.\n        *   (19,9) is 6. Map 6->6. Fill 6 at row 19.\n    *   **Column 10:**\n        *   (2,10) is 1. Map 1->1. Fill 1 from row 2 to 19.\n    *   **Column 11:**\n        *   (6,11) is 2. Map 2->4. Fill 4 from row 6 to 19.\n    *   **Column 13:**\n        *   (3,13) is 5. Map 5->7. Fill 7 from row 3 to 8.\n        *   (9,13) is 4. Map 4->1. Fill 1 from row 9 to 13.\n        *   (14,13) is 2. Map 2->4. Fill 4 from row 14 to 16.\n        *   (17,13) is 4. Map 4->1. Fill 1 from row 17 to 19.\n    *   **Column 16:**\n        *   (12,16) is 2. Map 2->4. Fill 4 from row 12 to 16.\n        *   (17,16) is 6. Map 6->6. Fill 6 from row 17 to 19.\n    *   **Column 17:**\n        *   (0,17) is 6. Map 6->6. Fill 6 from row 0 to 4.\n        *   (5,17) is 4. Map 4->1. Fill 1 from row 5 to 19.\n    *   **Column 18:**\n        *   (8,18) is 5. Map 5->7. Fill 7 from row 8 to 19.\n    *   **Column 19:**\n        *   (1,19) is 6. Map 6->6. Fill 6 from row 1 to 13.\n        *   (14,19) is 6. Map 6->6. Fill 6 from row 14 to 19. (Continuous 6 from 1 to 19).\n\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Initialize a 20x20 grid with 0s. Apply the filled vertical segments.\n\nOutput Grid:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,0,0,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,0,0,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,0,0,1,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,7,0,0,0,1,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,7,0,0,0,1,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,7,0,0,0,1,7,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,1,0,0,0,1,7,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,4,0,1,0,0,0,1,7,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,4,0,1,0,0,0,1,7,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,4,0,1,0,0,4,1,7,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,4,0,1,0,0,4,1,7,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,1,4,0,4,0,0,4,1,7,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,0,4,0,0,4,1,7,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,0,4,0,0,4,1,7,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,0,1,0,0,6,1,7,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,0,1,0,0,6,1,7,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,4,0,1,0,0,6,1,7,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1. **Example 1**: Row 0 has \"1,2,8,8,8\" which defines a transformation: color 1 \u2192 color 2. The 8s mark this as a definition. The 1s in the body become 2s, and the definition row becomes 0s.\n\n2. **Example 4**: Has \"2,1,8\" in the interior which defines a swap between colors 1 and 2. The main structural lines swap colors.\n\n3. **Examples 2 & 3**: Have 8-diamond patterns with associated colors that define transformations for different regions.\n\n**Key insight**: When cells show pattern \"color_A, color_B, 8...\" (colors immediately preceding 8s), this defines a transformation: color_A \u2192 color_B.\n\n**For the test input**, I identify three definition patterns near the 8s:\n- Row 2: `4,1,8` at columns 1,2,3 \u2192 **4 \u2192 1**\n- Row 6: `2,4,8` at columns 1,2,3 \u2192 **2 \u2192 4**  \n- Row 10: `5,7,8,8` at columns 1,2,3,4 \u2192 **5 \u2192 7**\n\n**Transformation rules:**\n1. All 8s become 0\n2. Definition cells (the color pairs next to 8s) become 0\n3. Remaining 4s \u2192 become 1s\n4. Remaining 2s \u2192 become 4s\n5. Remaining 5s \u2192 become 7s\n6. Colors without defined transformations (6s, 1s not in definitions) stay unchanged\n\n**Applying transformations to each cell:**\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Color Transformation Analysis**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack this ARC puzzle with these four examples. Let's see what we've got.\n\nFirst, I'm diving into Example 1. It's a 5x5 grid, and the initial thing that jumps out is that there are Blue, Red, and Teal colors. The output has removed Teal and mapped Red to the right edge. Something is going on with color and position mapping here, with Teal apparently being structural noise.\n\nMoving onto Example 2, this is a 15x15 grid that gives us a hint about this Teal stuff being \"dominant cyan structural clusters ... typically removed.\" It's definitely noise. This example is more complex, with more colors like Magenta, Yellow, Orange.  The input seems to map opposite sides - Top and Bottom, and Left and Right - to new colors on the output. So, it appears the key is mapping color markers from one side to another.\n\nIn Example 2, I identify colors on each side and it shows that the colors on each opposite side \"swap\".\n\nThe hypothesis for the color mapping:\n*   Identify marker color for each of the four sides.\n*   Construct the output by filling the corresponding sides with the marker color from the *opposite* side.\n\nTesting this, I go back to Example 1. But it doesn't quite fit - the output ends up with the Red color being on the right, but nothing on the others, which is strange. I need to re-evaluate it and find how this logic applies.\n\nExample 4 is similar, Top and Right are filled in the output, and there seems to be a Top to Right conversion, like the earlier ones.\n\nGoing through all the examples, I can see that there's a pattern: the most important thing is to focus on the colors at the edges of the grid. There are two general transformations in these examples: Swap Opposite Sides (top-to-bottom and left-to-right swap) or an Anti-Diagonal Reflection (top-to-right and left-to-bottom). It looks like the presence of markers and the shapes of the teal noise might dictate the transformation.\n\nIn Example 3, I get completely thrown off by the center pixel. And the color mapping is not consistent with swapping anything.\n\nFor this problem, \"dominant\" colors are key, not just any color. Also, the problem seems focused on the edge.\n\nIt seems like **the Teal structure defines the \"inside\", while the colors at the \"edge\" are the important parts**.\n\nNow, going through this Test Input, I've got to find the key colors. The edges are the most important. I'm grouping the colors into their edges. I am looking for the main marker for each edge. I'm noting 2, 5, 6 are prominent colors. I'm thinking about them as dominant colors.\n\nIt looks like the colors at the corners define the transformation, and how we map the sides to the output.\n\nGoing through all of these examples, I'm thinking about the most common type of transformation. I remember the hints - swapping opposite edges. Let's try to see if it is just always that type of swap.\n\nI will test this with each example, using the corner colors to map to the new sides. I feel the swap is more likely to apply (top/bottom and left/right swap).\n\nThe Teal pixels here and their general form do seem important for figuring out the transformation. But, they can be ignored for the output construction, just for their structure!\n\nTrying this method out... I will find the result for the Test Input.\n\nSo now, let me give you the construction of the final output. The key is in these three markers - Top, Bottom, Left, and Right.\n\nHere is the plan for my code:\n\n1.  *Clear the grid*: Set all cells to the background color (0).\n2.  *Define Regions:* Create regions for Top (rows 0-1), Bottom (rows 18-19), Left (cols 0-1 from rows 2-17), and Right (cols 18-19 from rows 2-17).\n3.  *Color Assignment:* Set colors for these regions based on the user's logic (Top color = Bottom input marker color, Bottom color = Top input marker color, Left color = Right input marker color, Right color = Left input marker color).\n4.  *Fill Patterns:* Use a checkerboard pattern.\n5.  *Output*\n\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation involves identifying \"marker\" colors on the perimeter of the input grid and reassigning them to different sides in the output, typically swapping opposite sides (180-degree rotation of assignments). The interior, usually containing a teal (8) structural cluster, is erased. The output sides are filled with a sparse, checkerboard-like pattern of the reassigned colors.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Marker Colors and Positions:**\n    *   **Left Input:** Contains Red (2).\n    *   **Right Input:** Contains Magenta (6).\n    *   **Bottom Input:** Contains Gray (5).\n    *   **Top Input:** Contains mixed signals, but the Top-Right corner has Magenta (6), similar to the Right side.\n    *   **Teal (8) Cluster:** Located in the interior/left, acts as structure to be removed.\n\n2.  **Determine Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Example 2 (15x15 grid) shows a clear **Swap Opposites** rule: Top Input $\\to$ Bottom Output, Bottom Input $\\to$ Top Output, Left Input $\\to$ Right Output, Right Input $\\to$ Left Output.\n    *   Example 4 (8x8 grid) shows an Anti-Diagonal swap, but Example 2 is closer in size (15x15 vs 20x20) and complexity (markers on all sides). The hints also explicitly mention \"swapping opposite edges\".\n    *   Applying **Swap Opposites** to Test Input:\n        *   **Top Output** receives color from **Bottom Input** (Gray, 5).\n        *   **Bottom Output** receives color from **Top Input** (Magenta, 6, derived from the corner/right dominance).\n        *   **Left Output** receives color from **Right Input** (Magenta, 6).\n        *   **Right Output** receives color from **Left Input** (Red, 2).\n\n3.  **Construct Output Pattern:**\n    *   The output is a 20x20 grid.\n    *   The pattern is a checkerboard filling the perimeter (rows 0-1, 18-19; cols 0-1, 18-19).\n    *   Based on Example 2 and 3, pixels are colored if the sum of their row and column indices is odd (parity check).\n    *   **Top Region (Rows 0-1):** Filled with Gray (5).\n    *   **Bottom Region (Rows 18-19):** Filled with Magenta (6).\n    *   **Left Region (Cols 0-1, Rows 2-17):** Filled with Magenta (6).\n    *   **Right Region (Cols 18-19, Rows 2-17):** Filled with Red (2).\n    *   Corner priority follows Example 2: Top/Bottom rows extend full width, covering the corners.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n*   **Rows 0-1:** Gray (5) at odd positions (`r+c` is odd).\n*   **Rows 18-19:** Magenta (6) at odd positions.\n*   **Rows 2-17:**\n    *   Cols 0-1: Magenta (6) at odd positions.\n    *   Cols 18-19: Red (2) at odd positions.\n    *   Interior: 0.\n\n0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5\n5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6\n6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing ARC Task and Examples**\n\nAlright, the user wants me to tackle an ARC task based on these examples. My initial impression is that there's some sort of color manipulation going on, probably involving swapping or shifting colors based on their initial location. I'm seeing patterns emerge, particularly around the edges of the grids and these teal structures that seem to be just noise that needs to be removed.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\nExample 1 is a bit confusing but shows that the colors in the output are determined by where the colors are located in the input grid. I see that the teal color at the top is replaced by red pixels. It appears that the output represents an inverted image of some form where the location of one pixel is changed into another location. The colors of the grid are \"mapped\" into positions in the Output, almost like a matrix transformation of the image or matrix.\n\nExample 2 is interesting; it's a bigger grid and has a more complex pattern of colors, but the main thing is that a set of colors is swapped to the opposites, and a large teal structure is removed from the grid. It looks like the colors at the four edges of the grid are swapped across edges, and the internal grid contents are removed. It's becoming clearer that the key is identifying \"edge colors\" and then swapping them across opposing sides of the output grid.\n\nExample 3 complicates things a bit.  It seems the \"swap\" logic I was seeing in Example 2 might be more nuanced and possibly involve only the opposite sides. It also may not be completely consistent with the previous examples. The output consists of a Top area filled with red and a bottom area filled with orange. The mapping between input/output colors is not clearly defined at this point.\n\nExample 4 simplifies things. It shows the basic side swap, so top goes right, and right goes top. Top is not completely filled, but just a singular pixel, while in Input, the shape is a complete horizontal line. This makes me consider if there is a pattern in the shape of the color?\n\n**Key Hypothesis Formulation**\n\nI'm thinking the core logic revolves around identifying significant \"edge colors\" within the input grid, specifically, the ones on the border or around a clear structure or clusters, and swapping them to their opposite side. The teal thing will be deleted. Perhaps the swap follows a rotation?  The core of my approach now is this:\n\n1.  **Identify Border Colors:** Look for colors concentrated around the edges of the grid.  Colors must not be part of the teal object\n2.  **Edge Mapping:**  Swap the colors associated with top/bottom or left/right sides.\n3.  **Output Generation:** Fill the corresponding side with a predictable pattern. A sparse checkerboard pattern seems to work best so far.\n\n**Examining the Test Input**\n\nI've got the Test Input now. It's a 20x20 grid with a bunch of colors scattered around, including the teal structure. Time to filter out \"noise\" and see if I can find the dominant edge colors.  I'm identifying the most frequent color on each edge.  Then I'll apply the swap.\n\nI've identified these colors as the primary markers on the sides. The key is in those edge pixels. I will swap those sides and use a checkerboard pattern.\n\n*   Left: Magenta (6)\n*   Right: Red (2)\n*   Top: 1 (Blue)\n*   Bottom: Grey (5).\n\nI'm starting to think that the output is not determined by an inverse matrix. I can use the same positions, but the mapping is just a swap of colors.\n\n**Finalized Plan**\n\nSo, the plan:\n\n1.  Isolate the border colors: from the input grid.\n2.  Implement the swap: top, bottom, left, and right colors.\n3.  Fill the borders: according to color.\n\nI am using a checkerboard-style border for the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on the logic inferred from examples. The examples show a process of removing a dominant \"noise\" structure (usually a large teal/8 cluster) and creating a patterned border using the colors found in the input.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Active Colors and Sides**:\n    *   The input contains a large teal (8) structure which is consistently removed in the output.\n    *   We look for other colors concentrated near the four edges (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).\n    *   **Left Side**: The color Red (2) appears at (1,0), (6,1), (14,1). This establishes Red (2) as the Left marker.\n    *   **Right Side**: The color Magenta (6) appears at (0,17), (1,19), (14,19). This establishes Magenta (6) as the Right marker.\n    *   **Bottom Side**: The color Grey (5) appears at (19,0), (16,2). This establishes Grey (5) as the Bottom marker.\n    *   **Top Side**: The color Blue (1) appears at (2,2) and (2,10). While less frequent, it is the only distinct color in the top region (Rows 0-2) that isn't part of the Left/Right edge groups. Thus, Blue (1) is the Top marker.\n    *   Other colors like Yellow (4) and Orange (7) are either scattered or singletons without a strong border presence, similar to how the Yellow (4) scattered pixels were ignored in Example 3.\n\n2.  **Determine Transformation Rule (Swapping)**:\n    *   Based on Example 2 and Example 4, the transformation involves **swapping the colors of opposite sides**.\n    *   **Top <-> Bottom**: The Top region takes the Bottom marker's color, and the Bottom region takes the Top marker's color.\n        *   New Top Color: **Grey (5)**.\n        *   New Bottom Color: **Blue (1)**.\n    *   **Left <-> Right**: The Left region takes the Right marker's color, and the Right region takes the Left marker's color.\n        *   New Left Color: **Magenta (6)**.\n        *   New Right Color: **Red (2)**.\n\n3.  **Construct Output Pattern**:\n    *   The output erases the interior (including the teal cluster).\n    *   It fills the perimeter with the new colors in a sparse/checkerboard pattern (as seen in Examples 2 and 3).\n    *   **Top Region (Rows 0-1)**: Filled with Grey (5) checkerboard.\n    *   **Bottom Region (Rows 18-19)**: Filled with Blue (1) checkerboard.\n    *   **Left Region (Cols 0-1)**: Filled with Magenta (6) checkerboard (vertical strips between top/bottom blocks).\n    *   **Right Region (Cols 18-19)**: Filled with Red (2) checkerboard (vertical strips between top/bottom blocks).\n\n**Output Generation**:\n*   **Top (Rows 0-1)**: `5, 0, 5, 0...` pattern.\n*   **Bottom (Rows 18-19)**: `1, 0, 1, 0...` pattern (offset on second row).\n*   **Left (Cols 0-1)**: `6, 0, 6, 0...` pattern in the middle rows.\n*   **Right (Cols 18-19)**: `2, 0, 2, 0...` pattern in the middle rows.\n\n0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5\n5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1\n1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify a consistent transformation pattern:\n\n**Key observations:**\n1. The cyan (8) structural cluster is always removed\n2. Colors adjacent to the 8s structure define marker-pattern relationships\n3. Border/edge colors swap to opposite sides\n4. Output patterns are sparse/checkerboard style, concentrated on the perimeter\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nThe 8s form a vertical diamond structure around columns 3-5, rows 1-11. Looking at the colors adjacent to this structure:\n- Row 2: 4 at col 1, 1 at col 2 \u2192 suggests 4\u21921 transformation  \n- Row 6: 2 at col 1, 4 at col 2 \u2192 suggests 2\u21924 transformation\n- Row 10: 5 at col 1, 7 at col 2 \u2192 suggests 5\u21927 transformation\n\n**Edge analysis:**\n- 6 appears predominantly on the right side (columns 7, 17, 19)\n- 2 appears on the left side (column 0, 1)\n- 5 appears scattered including bottom row\n- Following the swap rule: right colors go left, left colors go right\n\n**Constructing the output:**\n- Top rows: 7s in checkerboard (from transformed 5s moving up from bottom)\n- Left edge (cols 0-1): 6s (from right side moving left)\n- Right edge (cols 18-19): 4s (from 2s on left, transformed 2\u21924)\n- Bottom rows: 6s in checkerboard (6s from top moving down)\n- Interior: all 0s (8s region cleared)\n\n```\n0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7\n7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4\n0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6\n6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0\n```",

The output is almost entirely erased (set to 0) and replaced by a **sparse perimeter template**:\n   - Build a **2-cell-thick border** (top 2 rows, bottom 2 rows, left 2 columns, right 2 columns).\n   - Fill each band with a **checkerboard (every-other-cell) pattern**: a cell is colored iff \\((r+c)\\) is odd.\n4. **Swap opposite sides\u2019 colors** when drawing:\n   - Output **top band** uses the **bottom marker color**\n   - Output **bottom band** uses the **top marker color**\n   - Output **left band** uses the **right marker color**\n   - Output **right band** uses the **left marker color**\n   - Corners are naturally handled by the same checkerboard rule.\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\nBorder markers in the test input:\n- Top edge has a **6** \u2192 `topMarker = 6`\n- Bottom edge\u2019s first nonzero is **5** \u2192 `bottomMarker = 5`\n- Left edge\u2019s first nonzero is **2** \u2192 `leftMarker = 2`\n- Right edge\u2019s first nonzero is **6** \u2192 `rightMarker = 6`\n\nSo:\n- Top band color = bottomMarker = **5**\n- Bottom band color = topMarker = **6**\n- Left band color = rightMarker = **6**\n- Right band color = leftMarker = **2**\n\nInterior becomes all zeros.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5\n5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6\n6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0,6,0",

Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\n**Common to all pairs**\n- Background is black.\n- Output grids appear to be the **same size** as their corresponding inputs.\n- Outputs generally contain **far fewer colored cells** than inputs (many input cells disappear).\n\n### Pair 1\n- **Input 1:** A small black grid with a few colored cells (notably blue and red) concentrated near the **top edge** and the **right side**; most cells are black.\n- **Output 1:** Same-sized black grid with a **single red connected shape** near the **right side**. Blue cells seen in the input are not visible.\n\n### Pair 2\n- **Input 2:** A large black grid with:\n  - Sparse colored cells arranged along the **outer border**: magenta along the top edge, orange along the bottom edge, red along the left edge, yellow along the right edge (not fully continuous; looks \u201cspaced\u201d).\n  - A large **light-blue/cyan connected cluster** inside (cross/plus-like), with several small colored cells embedded/adjacent near it.\n  - At least one isolated colored cell in the interior (e.g., a red singleton on the right side).\n- **Output 2:** Same-sized grid where:\n  - The **interior is empty/black** (the large cyan cluster and interior singletons are gone).\n  - The **outer border** is populated by sparse colored cells (still \u201cspaced\u201d), but the **side-to-color assignment differs** from the input: top edge is orange, bottom edge is magenta, left edge is yellow, right edge is red.\n\n### Pair 3\n- **Input 3:** A large black grid with:\n  - Two separate **light-blue/cyan connected clusters** (diamond/cross-like), one roughly central and one near the lower-right area.\n  - Several **yellow singletons** scattered in the upper half.\n  - Small isolated colored cells near lower regions (including at least one red and one orange).\n- **Output 3:** Same-sized grid where:\n  - The cyan clusters and yellow singletons are not present.\n  - Three **larger corner-adjacent blocks** appear: two in the **top corners** (both red) and one in the **bottom-left corner** (orange). These blocks are made of many separated colored cells (a sparse/checker-like fill), not a solid rectangle.\n\n### Pair 4\n- **Input 4:** A small black grid with:\n  - A **vertical red bar/stripe** near the right side.\n  - A small **blue cluster** on the left side (a few cells forming a small rectilinear shape).\n- **Output 4:** Same-sized grid where:\n  - A **blue vertical bar/stripe** appears on the **right side**.\n  - A **red horizontal bar/stripe** appears along the **top edge**.\n  - The original left-side blue cluster from the input is not present in its original form/location.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement:** present  \n- **Object recoloring:** maybe (some colors disappear; unclear if any specific object is recolored vs removed/moved)  \n- **Bordering / outlining:** present (explicit border/edge patterns in outputs 2 and 4)  \n- **Filling holes or cavities:** absent  \n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** present (large interior structures often removed)  \n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** present (new corner blocks/edge bars appear not as direct copies of input shapes)  \n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center):** present (outputs heavily anchored to perimeter/corners)  \n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** maybe (large frequent cyan structures tend to be removed)  \n- **Size-based filtering or selection:** maybe (large cyan components removed; small markers seem to matter)  \n- **Symmetry or reflection operations:** maybe (pair 2 looks like swapping opposite sides of the border)  \n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** maybe (single/few markers become larger corner blocks in pair 3)  \n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** present (pair 3 converts sparse input markers into larger corner \u201cicons\u201d)  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **Perimeter anchoring dominates the outputs:** the remaining/created structures are almost entirely on the **outer border** or **corner-adjacent regions**, while the interior is largely cleared.\n2. **Large cyan connected components behave like \u201cnon-output scaffolding\u201d:** in multiple pairs, the biggest cyan shapes in the input are completely absent from the output, suggesting they are ignored or only used indirectly.\n3. **Border color reassignment is structured, not random:** in pair 2, the border colors clearly reappear but on **different sides** (top\u2194bottom and left\u2194right), while preserving the \u201cspaced\u201d/sparse style along each edge.\n4. **Output introduces standardized sparse patterns:** pair 3\u2019s corner blocks are not the same shapes as any input cluster; they look like **templated, sparse/checker-like patches** placed at corners.\n5. **Only a subset of colors survive:** outputs consistently use fewer colors than inputs, typically dropping scatter/noise colors and/or the dominant structural color (cyan).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nThe transformation appears to **discard most interior content** and then **reconstruct a perimeter-based representation** using a subset of \u201csignal\u201d colors from the input. These signal colors are placed on **edges and/or corners** in a sparse/checkered style; in at least one case, the border colors are **permuted across opposite sides** (top\u2194bottom, left\u2194right). A second plausible family is that an internal \u201ckey\u201d structure (often the large cyan cluster) indicates how to **remap** border/marker colors to their final edge/corner locations.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks you would perform when solving\n\n1. **Outer-ring comparison:** extract input\u2019s border ring and test whether the output border is a **180\u00b0 rotation / opposite-side swap** of those border colors (pair 2 suggests this).\n2. **Color-selection test:** compute color frequencies and connected components; check if the **largest component color (often cyan)** is always removed and whether only small \u201cmarker\u201d colors remain.\n3. **Corner-icon template detection:** measure the size and parity pattern of corner blocks in outputs (e.g., are they fixed-size **checkerboard patches**?), and see what minimal input markers trigger them.\n4. **Mapping from marker position to corner/edge:** for each surviving input color pixel, test rules like **nearest corner**, **quadrant**, or **edge-opposite** placement.\n5. **Invariance checks:** confirm output uses **only colors present in input**, preserves grid size, and that the interior is intentionally blanked.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* Outputs largely erase the interior and concentrate results on the **perimeter (edges/corners)**.\n* A dominant **cyan structural cluster** appears in inputs but is typically **removed** in outputs; smaller marker colors drive the result.\n* Border colors can be **reassigned to different sides** (notably swapping opposite edges) while keeping a sparse/\u201cevery-other-cell\u201d border style.\n* Some outputs create **templated corner patches** (sparse/checker-like blocks) rather than copying input shapes directly.\nHINT_END",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Test Input: Decoding the Pattern**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to solve this ARC task, and I'm diving in. Seems like we're given some examples, and then a test input. So, it's about finding the logic and applying it.\n\nFirst, I'm noting that the \"8\" is a noise indicator. In Example 1, we had a row with \"1,2,8...\", and the output somehow transformed the \"1\"s into \"2\"s. Example 2 introduced new mappings, like \"6\" to \"7\", and \"2\" <-> \"4\". \"8\"s are clearly not part of the signal. They are a code, or marker!\n\nOk, the first example seems to suggest a \"color swapping\" based on numbers around the 8s. The examples are pointing at a 'code row' with numbers next to each other. If we find something like \"A, B, 8\", the signal is \"A becomes B\".  So I'm going to look for those code-rows - rows with that \"8\" noise.\n\nThen there's the 'filling' behavior, where the new colors seem to complete shapes, or complete the region.  In Example 1, the 1 at (0,4) became a vertical line of 2s; is it \"completing\" a line. In Ex 2, we get a sort of checkerboard of 2s and 4s. Let me first find the mappings and then trace what patterns they are making!\n\nNow, the test input. I'm focusing on those code rows again, looking for \"8\" and adjacent numbers. The rows with \"8\" look interesting. We have `2,0,0,8`, or  `4,1,8`, or `5,7,8`. That, I think, gives me some color mappings: 2 <-> 4, and 5 <-> 7. The code rows should be the key to the pattern, or key to decoding the puzzle. Now let me look into what happens with the 6s!\n\nI'm thinking I'm getting a handle on the pattern. It's looking like this:\n1.  Look for code rows, those rows with the magic \"8\".\n2.  Get the mappings; numbers on either side of the 8 get swapped or changed.\n3.  Remove code rows from the grid.\n4.  Remove the noisy 8s\n5.  Swap the colors as defined by the code rows.\n6.  *Then*, the fun part:  \"fill.\" That's the shape part of it.\nThis seems like a solid plan.\n\nOk, now, apply all that to the test input. Going to look closely at the code rows and get the color pairs: `1->4`; `2->4`, `5->7`! OK! I should remove the code rows!\n\nSo, I'm going to do my best to see what happens here. If I swap these colors, I see that I'm supposed to 'fill' shapes. Now, I have to figure out how to fill the shapes.\n\nNext - The \"fill\" part. This is important. It's about filling between end-points of pixels. I need to be more precise about the pattern, looking at the pattern shape in the Examples. Should the fill be just horizontal? Or maybe vertical? Or some other shape?\n\nAfter the mappings, the structure of the remaining colored pixels (i.e. not zero, not eight) defines the shape. With the mappings, the original colors become new colors in the resulting grid, and they are not always a straight line! We need to follow, or complete the shape! Now, to complete the puzzle, I have to *see* the complete, expected output.\n\nLet me draw the lines. Based on the mapping and filling patterns, this becomes the *complete* set. So, I need to do the following: identify the structure, fill lines with the new colour, *then*, construct the final grid.\n\nThen, I'll identify lines, the diagonal lines, etc. and draw them. I will fill a row/column with new color, if there's multiple pixels of the same colour. I'm seeing patterns now!\n\nOkay, let me put this together and create the output!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task based on examples. The transformation involves identifying \"noise\" or \"code\" rows (marked by the color 8), extracting color mapping rules from them, clearing those rows, and then completing patterns (filling gaps and extending diagonals) with the mapped colors.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Code Rows & Mappings:**\n    The input grid contains several rows with the noise color '8'. We treat these as \"code rows\" that define color swaps and are then deleted.\n    -   Row 1: `2, 0, 0, 8, ... 6`. (Contains 2, 8).\n    -   Row 2: `0, 4, 1, 8...`. (Contains 4, 1, 8).\n    -   Row 6: `0, 2, 4, 8...`. (Contains 2, 4, 8).\n    -   Row 10: `0, 5, 7, 8...`. (Contains 5, 7, 8).\n    \n    Inferred Mappings:\n    -   `5, 7, 8` implies **5 \u2194 7**.\n    -   The structural pixels in the grid are primarily 2, 4, 5, 6.\n    -   The mappings for 1, 2, 4, 6 appear to consolidate to a single color, likely **6**.\n        -   Row 2 (`4, 1`) and Row 6 (`2, 4`) and Row 1 (`2, 6`) link 1, 2, 4, 6 together.\n        -   Given the output usually simplifies colors, we map **2 \u2192 6**, **4 \u2192 6**, **6 \u2192 6**.\n        -   We map **5 \u2192 7**.\n\n2.  **Filter & Recolor Grid:**\n    -   We keep only \"image rows\" (Rows 0, 4, 8, 12-19) and the structural pixels within them, mapped to the new colors.\n    -   **Color 7 (from 5):**\n        -   Row 8, Col 18.\n        -   Row 16, Col 2.\n        -   Row 19, Col 0.\n    -   **Color 6 (from 2, 4, 6):**\n        -   Row 0, Col 17.\n        -   Row 8, Col 6.\n        -   Row 12, Col 16.\n        -   Row 14, Cols 1, 5, 13, 19.\n        -   Row 15, Col 13.\n        -   Row 17, Cols 13, 16 (derived).\n        -   Row 19, Col 9.\n\n3.  **Pattern Completion (Diagonals & Fills):**\n    We look for alignment between these points to draw lines and fill regions.\n    -   **Diagonal Lines:**\n        -   **Color 7:** Points (8,18) and (16,2) align with slope -2 (down 1, left 2). We draw this line: (8,18), (9,16), (10,14), (11,12), (12,10), (13,8), (14,6), (15,4), (16,2).\n        -   **Color 6:** Points (14,19) and (19,9) align with slope -2. We draw this line: (14,19), (15,17), (16,15), (17,13), (18,11), (19,9).\n        -   **Color 6:** Points (12,16) and (19,9) align with slope -1 (down 1, left 1). Note (15,13) is also on this line. We draw: (12,16), (13,15), (14,14), (15,13), (16,12), (17,11), (18,10), (19,9).\n    \n    -   **Horizontal Filling:**\n        -   For each row, if there are multiple pixels of the *same* color (including those added by diagonals), fill the horizontal span between the leftmost and rightmost.\n        -   **Row 14 (Color 6):** Original points at 1, 5, 13, 19. Fill 1 to 19 with 6. (Note: The 7 at (14,6) from the diagonal is preserved/overlaid).\n        -   **Row 15 (Color 6):** Points at 13 (original) and 17 (diag). Fill 13-17.\n        -   **Row 16 (Color 6):** Points at 12 (diag), 15 (diag). Fill 12-15.\n        -   **Row 17 (Color 6):** Points at 11 (diag), 13 (original), 16 (original). Fill 11-16.\n        -   **Row 18 (Color 6):** Points at 10 (diag), 11 (diag). Fill 10-11.\n\n4.  **Final Assembly:**\n    -   Apply the fills and diagonals to a cleared 20x20 grid.\n    -   Row 14 is a solid bar of 6s, interrupted by the 7 diagonal at col 6.\n    -   Diagonals and fills create a structured shape at the bottom right.\n    -   Isolated points (0,17), (8,6), (19,0) remain.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,0,0\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Comprehensive ARC Task Resolution**\n\nAlright, let's break down this ARC task. The core is to map input colors to new output colors based on patterns and \"instructional\" rows. I've got to find these instruction sets and then apply the recoloring and filling rules.\n\nFirst, I identified instruction rows which are rows containing the number \"8.\" Usually, these instructions are key to defining what is supposed to change, and often define the boundary of data sections as well. It looks like the process is:\n\n1.  **Instruction Parse:** Identify rows containing \"8\" to define what is supposed to happen in the image. From this I will parse pairs that are present.\n2.  **Define Regions**: The noise or key lines will partition the image into distinct regions. I need to handle each region distinctly and may extend the fill through some of them.\n3.  **Color Mapping:** Inside the Key rows, there are mappings for the data. In Ex 1, a key pair in Row 0 suggests changing a specific input color to output. If the Input has a pattern of vertical or lattice, so should the output. If sparse, also expect that.\n4.  **Recoloring and Fill:** Based on these instructions, replace colors in the input. If the output creates gaps in a column that have the same color, fill those gaps. If they have different colors, determine boundaries by taking a Voronoi distance partitioning.\n\nUsing Example 1, I find the core logic: *1, 2, 8*, means 1 becomes 2. I identify seeds. Since the seeds are in columns that are not directly adjacent, I fill within these columns, to the specified location.\n\nExample 2 showed more complexity. Here I identified the \"key\" row containing *4, 2, 8*. This leads me to believe 4 should map to 2. The *8* delineates the key. Additionally, I infer *6, 7* from the problem, as it is found in multiple places and the key row does not have it. The pattern is horizontal/vertical lines. It extends through.\n\nThe test input is 20x20. I identify separators/keys as rows with `8`, specifically rows 1-3, 5-7, 9-11. From there I parse the mappings: 6->2, 2->4, 4->1, 5->7.  I proceed to recolor the \"data\" rows. In specific columns I split at a midpoint between two values, creating a smooth transition. I will handle each section/column distinctly to create a smooth pattern. This is a robust framework to solve ARC tasks.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on patterns inferred from the solved examples. The examples suggest a process of identifying \"key\" rows (often indicated by the noise color '8' or specific placement), extracting color mapping rules from them, clearing the key rows, and then using the mappings to recolor and fill the regions defined by the data pixels.\n\n### Analysis of the Test Input\n\n1.  **Identify Key Rows and Mappings:**\n    We scan the grid for rows containing the noise color '8', which serve as key/instruction rows.\n    -   **Rows 1-3:** Contain '8's.\n        -   Row 1: `2, ..., 8, ..., 6`. This pairs **2** and **6**.\n        -   Row 2: `0, 4, 1, 8, ...`. This pairs **4** and **1**.\n        -   Row 3: `... 8 ... 5`. (Incomplete, but Row 10 confirms 5's pair).\n    -   **Rows 5-7:** Contain '8's.\n        -   Row 6: `... 2, 4, 8, ...`. This pairs **2** and **4**.\n    -   **Rows 9-11:** Contain '8's.\n        -   Row 10: `... 5, 7, 8, ...`. This pairs **5** and **7**.\n\n    **Derived Mappings:**\n    By checking the \"data\" pixels (pixels in non-8 rows) against these pairs, we determine the direction of the mapping (Data Color $\\to$ Target Color).\n    -   Data has **6** (Row 0, 14, 17, 19). Pair (2, 6) $\\implies$ **6 $\\to$ 2**.\n    -   Data has **2** (Row 8, 12, 14). Pair (2, 4) $\\implies$ **2 $\\to$ 4**.\n    -   Data has **4** (Row 15, 17). Pair (4, 1) $\\implies$ **4 $\\to$ 1**.\n    -   Data has **5** (Row 8, 16, 19). Pair (5, 7) $\\implies$ **5 $\\to$ 7**.\n\n2.  **Identify Regions and Transformations:**\n    The key rows (1-3, 5-7, 9-11) act as separators. We process the \"Data Regions\" between them. The fill operation extends vertically within the region boundaries.\n\n    -   **Region 1 (Row 0):** Above the first separator.\n        -   Input: `6` at (0, 17).\n        -   Transform: $6 \\to 2$.\n        -   Fill: Single pixel at (0, 17) becomes **2**.\n\n    -   **Region 2 (Row 4):** Between Separators 1 and 2.\n        -   Input: Empty.\n        -   Output: Empty (0s).\n\n    -   **Region 3 (Row 8):** Between Separators 2 and 3.\n        -   Input: `2` at (8, 6), `5` at (8, 18).\n        -   Transform: $2 \\to 4$, $5 \\to 7$.\n        -   Fill: Single pixel at (8, 6) becomes **4**. Single pixel at (8, 18) becomes **7**.\n\n    -   **Region 4 (Rows 12-19):** Below Separator 3.\n        -   We fill the columns in this region (Rows 12-19) based on the mapped seeds. If a column has multiple seeds of different resulting colors, we split the column using nearest-neighbor logic.\n\n        -   **Col 0:** Seed `5` at Row 19. Transform $5 \\to 7$. Fill Col 0 with **7**.\n        -   **Col 1:** Seed `2` at Row 14. Transform $2 \\to 4$. Fill Col 1 with **4**.\n        -   **Col 2:** Seed `5` at Row 16. Transform $5 \\to 7$. Fill Col 2 with **7**.\n        -   **Col 5:** Seed `2` at Row 14. Transform $2 \\to 4$. Fill Col 5 with **4**.\n        -   **Col 9:**\n            -   Seed `4` at Row 15 $\\to$ **1**.\n            -   Seed `6` at Row 19 $\\to$ **2**.\n            -   Midpoint is 17. Rows 12-17 fill with **1**, Rows 18-19 fill with **2**.\n        -   **Col 13:**\n            -   Seed `2` at Row 14 $\\to$ **4**.\n            -   Seed `4` at Row 17 $\\to$ **1**.\n            -   Midpoint is 15.5. Rows 12-15 fill with **4**, Rows 16-19 fill with **1**.\n        -   **Col 16:**\n            -   Seed `2` at Row 12 $\\to$ **4**.\n            -   Seed `6` at Row 17 $\\to$ **2**.\n            -   Midpoint is 14.5. Rows 12-14 fill with **4**, Rows 15-19 fill with **2**.\n        -   **Col 19:** Seed `6` at Row 14. Transform $6 \\to 2$. Fill Col 19 with **2**.\n\n3.  **Final Grid Construction:**\n    All key rows (1-3, 5-7, 9-11) and empty regions are set to 0. The calculated pixels are placed in their respective regions.\n\n### Completed Output Grid\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,4,7,0,0,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,2\n7,4,7,0,0,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,2\n7,4,7,0,0,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,2\n7,4,7,0,0,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,0,0,2\n7,4,7,0,0,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,2\n7,4,7,0,0,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,2\n7,4,7,0,0,4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,2\n7,4,7,0,0,4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,2\n```",

identify \u201ckey\u201d color pair(s) (notably 1\u21942, 2\u21944, 6\u21947 and/or one-way mappings like 1\u21922, 4\u21922, 1\u21927), apply recolor/swap; optionally delete the key row/pixels afterward; remove non-structural leftover pixels; complete shapes by filling gaps between same-color endpoints (row/column); extend some seeds as diagonals/zigzags (often on a checkerboard lattice); optionally generate full checkerboard/lattice bands and separate results into top/bottom regions with intervening rows cleared to 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n## Analysis of Examples:\n\n**Example 1 & 4:** Show simple color pair mappings defined by a \"key\" row. The key format is [color1, color2, 8s...], where 8s are noise. The mapping is color1\u2192color2, and 8s are erased.\n\n**Example 2 & 3:** Show more complex transformations with scattered markers being transformed and potentially extended into checkerboard patterns.\n\n## Key Pattern Recognition:\n\nIn the test input, I can identify three key patterns adjacent to 8s (noise):\n- Row 2, cols 1-2: **4, 1** followed by 8s \u2192 defines 4\u21921 mapping\n- Row 6, cols 1-2: **2, 4** followed by 8s \u2192 defines 2\u21924 mapping  \n- Row 10, cols 1-2: **5, 7** followed by 8s \u2192 defines 5\u21927 mapping\n\n## Transformation Steps:\n\n1. **Erase all 8s** (noise color)\n2. **Erase key definition pixels** at (2,1), (2,2), (6,1), (6,2), (10,1), (10,2)\n3. **Apply color mappings:**\n   - All 4s become 1s\n   - All 2s become 4s\n   - All 5s become 7s\n4. **Keep 6s unchanged** (not part of any key pair)\n5. **Keep existing 1s unchanged** (they're target colors, not source)\n\n## Applying to Test Input:\n\nTracing through each non-zero position:\n- 2s at (1,0), (6,11), (8,6), (12,16), (14,1), (14,5), (14,13) \u2192 become 4s\n- 4s at (5,17), (9,13), (15,9), (17,13) \u2192 become 1s\n- 5s at (3,13), (8,18), (10,9), (16,2), (19,0) \u2192 become 7s\n- 6s stay as 6s\n- 1 at (2,10) stays as 1\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Delete noise**: treat color **8** as noise and erase it (set to 0).  \n   (In this task, the scattered **5** pixels behave like non-structural noise too, so they are not preserved in the output.)\n\n2. **Find \u201csignal\u201d rows/columns**: for any **row or column** that contains **at least two pixels of the same nonzero color**, use those pixels as *seeds* to generate a longer structure.\n\n3. **Grow each such seed-set into a 2-cell-thick zigzag (checkerboard) line**:\n   - For a **row**: let `minC..maxC` be the min/max column of those seeds. Draw across `minC-1 .. maxC+1` (clipped to the grid).\n     - Use the row itself and the **adjacent row toward the nearest border** (up if closer to top, down if closer to bottom).\n     - Let `p = (seed_column mod 2)` (the seeds share the same parity in these tasks).  \n       Put the output color on:\n       - the **adjacent** row at columns with parity `p`\n       - the **original** row at columns with parity `1-p`\n   - For a **column**: similarly use `minR..maxR`, draw across `minR-1 .. maxR+1`, and zigzag between the column and its adjacent column toward the nearest border, using row parity.\n\n4. **Recolor while drawing** (as shown by the examples\u2019 paired recolors):\n   - `6 \u2192 7`\n   - `2 \u2192 4`\n   - `4 \u2192 2`\n   - `1 \u2192 7`\n\n5. **Everything else becomes 0** (only the generated zigzag structures remain).\n\nApplying those steps to the test input yields the following output grid:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7\n0,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0\n0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,7,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,7,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,7,0\n4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,2,4,0,0,0,0,7\n0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,2,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

                "response": "**Analyzing Grid Object Types**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a collection of grids, and the goal is to describe the types of objects they contain, keeping it general, and not trying to divine any underlying rules. I'm focusing on object attributes and colors, not any transformations or relationships between the grids.  I've got to use these numeric color values (0-9) only.  Sounds straightforward enough.\n\nFirst, I looked at each grid individually. I started by figuring out the background color.  Almost every grid has a background of 0.  Then I started looking for common object types.  I noticed lots of isolated pixels, which I'd call \"noise,\" or possibly loose clusters of pixels.  These colors are all over the place: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.  Sometimes the pixels form clusters or small shapes.\n\nNext, I saw lines.  Some grids have horizontal lines, like in Grid 7 (1s), or vertical lines (Grid 3, 1s). Lines are definitely a common feature, using colors 1, 2, and 4.  \n\nThen there were these large textured regions or fields. Grid 4 has those, with patterns of color 2 and color 7 (diagonal or checkerboard-like). Other grids have broader patterns, often alternating.\n\nFinally, I encountered complex clusters.  Grid 6 has this really intricate shape made from pixels of 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8. These are more than just single lines; they form cohesive, larger shapes.\n\nAfter looking through all the grids, I felt like I had a good handle on the main object types. Now I need to distill this down into a concise summary with those `<objects_summary>` tags.\n\n```xml\n<objects_summary>\nBackground (0), Isolated Pixels, Lines (Vertical/Horizontal), Patterned Regions (Checkerboard/Lattice), Multi-color Clusters.\n</objects_summary>\n```\n\n\nThe objects in the provided grids can be categorized into several distinct types based on their structural attributes and pixel arrangements.\n\n**Background**\nThe fundamental substrate for all grids is a background filled with color 0. All other objects exist as non-zero pixels placed upon this field.\n\n**Isolated Pixels and Scattered Noise**\nMany grids feature single, isolated pixels or very small, non-contiguous groups of pixels. These appear as \"noise\" or scattered points rather than coherent shapes.\n*   **Attributes:** These pixels vary widely in color, including colors 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. They lack connectivity and appear at irregular intervals across the grid.\n\n**Linear Structures**\nThere are distinct linear objects composed of contiguous pixels extending either horizontally or vertically.\n*   **Horizontal Lines:** These appear as rows of a single color (e.g., color 1 or color 2) spanning a portion or the full width of the grid.\n*   **Vertical Lines/Columns:** These appear as columns of a single color (e.g., color 1, color 2, or color 4). In some instances, these lines act as boundaries or dividers.\n\n**Patterned Fields / Textured Regions**\nLarge sections of the grids are occupied by non-solid \"fields\" of color. Instead of solid blocks, these objects are defined by a repeating texture or lattice pattern.\n*   **Attributes:** The most common texture is a checkerboard or diagonal lattice arrangement where a non-zero color (such as color 2, color 7, or color 8) alternates with the background color 0. These fields can cover significant portions of the grid, distinct from the smaller isolated pixels.\n\n**Multi-Color Clusters**\nSome grids contain dense, complex groupings of pixels involving multiple colors adjacent to one another.\n*   **Attributes:** These clusters form specific, compact shapes (unlike the diffuse patterned fields). One notable example includes a symmetrical or semi-symmetrical arrangement involving colors 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 clustered together.\n\n**Alternating Sequences**\nDistinct from the large fields, there are specific rows or columns that feature a strict alternating sequence (e.g., color 6 alternating with color 0, or color 7 alternating with color 0) in a single line.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Color 0 field.\n2. Isolated Pixels: Scattered single points of colors 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n3. Linear Structures: Vertical and horizontal lines (solid or alternating) composed of colors 1, 2, 4, 6.\n4. Patterned Fields: Large regions defined by lattice or checkerboard textures using colors 2, 7, 8.\n5. Complex Clusters: Dense, multi-colored shapes containing adjacent pixels of various colors.\n</objects_summary>",

                "response": "### Transformations observed / inferred from the example input\u2192output pairs\n\n#### 1) Color deletion / background cleanup\n- **8 \u2192 0**: In every example, color **8** present in the input is **completely removed** in the output (replaced by **0**).\n- **Removal of \u201cnon-participating\u201d pixels**: Pixels/colors not contributing to the final structure are often erased to **0** (e.g., extra scattered 1/2/8 pixels in Example 4 disappear).\n\n#### 2) Color remapping and/or pairwise swapping\nAcross examples there are strong signs of **pairwise color exchange** or **one-way recoloring** driven by a small \u201ckey\u201d pattern:\n- **1 \u2194 2 swap** (Example 4; and plausibly Example 1 if the top-row \u201c1,2\u201d is a key).\n- **2 \u2194 4 swap** (Example 2: left-side 2 and right-side 4 become left-side 4 and right-side 2).\n- **6 \u2194 7 swap / reassignment** (Example 2: large 7-pattern appears where 6-pattern existed and 6 appears where 7 markers were).\n- **One-way recolor** when only one of the paired colors survives in output:\n  - Example 1 behaves like **1 \u2192 2** (with the \u201c2\u201d in the key area not kept as an object).\n  - Example 3 behaves like **4 \u2192 2** and **1 \u2192 7** (with original 2/7 acting more like \u201cpaint colors\u201d/keys than preserved objects).\n\n#### 3) Deleting a \u201clegend/key\u201d row or key pixels after use\n- **Key row removal**: Example 1 strongly suggests the **top row is a palette/legend**, used to derive recoloring (e.g., 1\u21922), then **cleared to 0** in the output.\n- **Key-pair removal**: In larger examples, vertically/horizontally adjacent multi-color \u201ckey\u201d pixels can plausibly be treated as **instructions** (color-pair definitions) and then not reproduced as objects.\n\n#### 4) Object selection / noise filtering (keep only the main structure)\n- **Keep only the dominant line(s)/components** and delete the rest:\n  - Example 4 keeps the long **horizontal line** and long **vertical line** (after color swap), while removing all other stray pixels (even if they share the swapped colors).\n- This can be interpreted as:\n  - Keeping only the **largest connected components** of the relevant colors, or\n  - Keeping only pixels that lie on the **major detected lines** (longest row-run / column-run).\n\n#### 5) Line completion: fill gaps between same-color endpoints (orthogonal)\n- Example 1 shows classic **gap filling**:\n  - After recolor to **2**, the output fills the **vertical span** between topmost and bottommost occurrences in a column (the column containing the endpoints), creating a continuous segment.\n- A generalized version observed/possible:\n  - For each row/column with \u22652 pixels of a color, fill all cells between the extreme positions with that color.\n\n#### 6) Diagonal / zigzag propagation (often \u201cstair-stepped\u201d)\n- Example 2 and Example 3 outputs contain **diagonal-looking structures** that manifest as **zigzags between two adjacent columns** (or rows), consistent with:\n  - Extending pixels **diagonally** (NE/NW/SE/SW), and/or\n  - Extending diagonals while staying on a **checkerboard lattice** (which forces \u201cstair-step\u201d motion).\n- This appears in Example 2 as edge zigzags:\n  - Left side: 4 alternates between columns 1\u20132 down the grid.\n  - Right side: 2 alternates between columns 14\u201315 down the grid.\n\n#### 7) Checkerboard / lattice pattern generation\n- Example 2 top rows form a **full-width checkerboard** of **7** and **0**.\n- Example 3 contains larger **lattice-like** patterns of **2** (upper region) and **7** (lower region).\n- Plausible mechanism:\n  - Start from an alternating single-row pattern, then **duplicate it** with a **1-cell horizontal shift** to create a 2-row checkerboard.\n  - Or generate a parity-restricted fill where pixels appear only on one coordinate parity ((r+c) mod 2 fixed).\n\n#### 8) Spatial relocation / banding (top/bottom partitioning)\n- Example 3 output is split into:\n  - A **top band** containing only **2** pattern,\n  - A large **middle region cleared to 0**,\n  - A **bottom band** containing only **7** pattern.\n- This implies possible operations:\n  - **Separate** different transformed color groups into different vertical zones (top vs bottom).\n  - **Clear** intermediate rows entirely to create separation.\n\n#### 9) Reflection / left-right side exchange (positional inversion)\n- Example 2 strongly suggests **left/right inversion** paired with recoloring:\n  - Input\u2019s left-side markers of **2** and right-side markers of **4** appear reversed in output (left becomes 4, right becomes 2).\n- This can be viewed as:\n  - A **mirror reflection** across the vertical centerline combined with recoloring, or\n  - Direct **swap of \u201crole\u201d** of left/right marker colors.\n\n---\n\n<transformation_summary>\nErase noise color 8\u21920;

remove non-structural leftover pixels; complete shapes by filling gaps between same-color endpoints (row/column); extend some seeds as diagonals/zigzags (often on a checkerboard lattice); optionally generate full checkerboard/lattice bands and separate results into top/bottom regions with intervening rows cleared to 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
