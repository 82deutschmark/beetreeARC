        "Full raw LLM response": "**Comprehensive Analysis of an ARC Task and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I've got this ARC task to solve, and it seems to involve deciphering transformations based on examples and a test input. I need to break down the problem systematically.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the examples to understand the core logic. Example 1 has me looking at these \"boxes\" defined by a 0 border, and their content which is filled with 5s or 7s. There are also these \"wires\" made of 9s, and it looks like their location somehow relates to how the boxes' contents change. I'm seeing that maybe the wires transmit something to the box, like a liquid or a color. In Ex 1, a box with all 5s has its top-left pixel become 7 when it is \"connected\" with a wire of 9s. Ex 1 also has a box with 7/5 inside (so the 7 color is present) that becomes 7/7 (so the 5s turned into 7s).\n\nExample 2 reinforces the \"wires\" concept. I noticed boxes moving to a location which is on the other side of the wires, it seems like the wires are like portals or a pipeline. I'm also seeing that when boxes move to the other side of wires, their interior color changes from 5s to 7s. In this example, I'm noting that the wires can be either horizontal or vertical.\n\nExample 3 is starting to paint the picture more clearly. The wires have 9s, and I saw a key concept of a **vertical** line of `7`s, and the output had the `7`s spread. The vertical orientation of the 7s seems to matter for how the colors in the output grid will be.\n\nI'm thinking 7s act like a fluid or \"active material\". 5s are neutral. It seems that when a box is connected to wires, the 7s are either flowing into the box or spreading from one location to another. The direction of 7 seems linked to gravity, or the source of these 7s.\n\nI've got a working hypothesis. I'm calling the core idea \"movement/spread and filling\". It's something like this:\n\n1.  There are these horizontal or vertical wire segments (9s).\n2.  If a box is beside one of those wires, it \"moves\" to be next to another wire segment. If there isn't another segment, it spreads/fills.\n3.  As part of the move (or fill), all 5s in a box become 7s.\n\nNow, let's test this with the Test Input. This input has a bunch of boxes and wires, and I've started mapping the main interactions. I have identified 3 main things that are happening:\n*   A box on the left, which has a wire on the top. It seems it is a \"fill\" and stays.\n*   A box in the middle, sitting above a wire. It is going to \"move\" down to a new position.\n*   A box on the right, also moving down. There is a corresponding wire below, and it is also going to move.\n\nI need to apply the rules to the test input. I see one box does not move because it is like Ex 1, it's just a fill operation. Two other boxes should move, so I will determine the precise new location. In both moving boxes, the inner `5`s have to become `7`s. I will need to be careful with the new locations to make sure there are no overlaps.\n\nOkay, let's render the output. I need to handle all the \"move\" and \"fill\" steps. I've now drawn the picture of the final output, ensuring that the wires remain if they are not the source. The box which does not move stays where it is. I am also updating the contents correctly, changing any `5`s to `7`s in the final output and leaving the wires.\n\nI'll double-check everything (wire locations, box locations, color changes) to be sure it all aligns with the patterns and logic. I've considered potential edge cases like what happens if a wire is not adjacent to anything.\n\nFinally, I'm set!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from three examples.\n\n**Logic Inference:**\n\n1.  **Identify Components:** The grid contains **Boxes** (outlined by black `0`s, containing grey `5`s and/or orange `7`s), **Wires** (magenta/maroon `9`s), and **Background** (magenta `6`s).\n2.  **Box-Wire Interaction:** Boxes are attached to Wires. A Box is \"attached\" if one of its sides is adjacent to a line of `9`s.\n3.  **Transformation Rule - Content:** Inside the boxes, grey `5` pixels transform into orange `7` pixels. This mimics a \"fill\" or \"flow\" operation where orange fluid fills the container. In all solved examples, the output boxes are filled with `7`s (or mostly filled).\n4.  **Transformation Rule - Movement:**\n    *   If a Box is attached to a Wire (Source), and there exists another identical Wire (Destination) elsewhere in the grid that is not currently connected to a box, the Box **moves** from the Source Wire to the Destination Wire.\n    *   The Box preserves its relative orientation to the wire (e.g., if it was North of the Source Wire, it moves to be North of the Destination Wire).\n    *   When a Box moves, the **Source Wire is removed** (turns into background `6`s). The Destination Wire remains.\n    *   If there is no corresponding Destination Wire (or if the Box is already at the destination), the Box **stays in place** and only the content transformation (filling with `7`s) occurs. The Wire remains.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe Test Input contains four distinct structures:\n\n1.  **Object A (Left):** A large box at Rows 13-23, Cols 1-7. It is attached to the South side of a Wire at Row 12. There is another Wire at Row 3 (Cols 1-7). However, the box is at the bottom (South) of its wire. Moving to the \"South\" of Wire 3 would place it in Rows 4-14. While the space is empty, the logic from the examples suggests that if a Box is already at the bottom of the flow or if the configuration doesn't strictly match a \"teleport\" pair (perhaps due to the directional flow implied by gravity), it might just fill. More importantly, in Example 1, boxes attached to wires just filled. Given the Box is partially filled with 7s at the top, it implies a filling process in situ. Let's assume it **stays and fills**.\n    *   *Correction based on strict movement logic:* If it moved 12->3, it would go Up. If 3->12, it would go Down. It is currently at 12. If 3 is the source and 12 is the destination, the box has already arrived. Thus, it stays.\n    *   **Action:** Box A stays. Interior `5`s become `7`s. Wire 12 stays. Wire 3 stays.\n\n2.  **Object B (Middle):** A box at Rows 0-7, Cols 11-15. Attached to the North side of a Wire at Row 8. There is a matching Wire at Row 23 (Cols 11-15).\n    *   **Action:** Box B moves from North-of-Row-8 to North-of-Row-23.\n    *   **New Location:** Rows 15-22, Cols 11-15.\n    *   **Content:** Interior `5`s become `7`s.\n    *   **Wires:** Source Wire at Row 8 is removed. Destination Wire at Row 23 stays.\n\n3.  **Object C (Right):** A box at Rows 0-13, Cols 22-25. Attached to the North side of a Wire at Row 14. There is a matching Wire at Row 25 (Cols 22-25).\n    *   **Action:** Box C moves from North-of-Row-14 to North-of-Row-25.\n    *   **New Location:** Rows 11-24, Cols 22-25.\n    *   **Content:** Interior `5`s become `7`s (Input was mostly 7s, so it becomes all 7s).\n    *   **Wires:** Source Wire at Row 14 is removed. Destination Wire at Row 25 stays.\n\n4.  **Object D (Mid-Right column):** A narrow box at Rows 20-25, Cols 17-19. Attached to the South side of a Wire at Row 19. No matching destination wire is found for a width-3 connection.\n    *   **Action:** Box D stays. Interior `5`s become `7`s. Wire 19 stays.\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid:**\n\n*   **Background:** 6\n*   **Wires:** Keep Row 3 (1-7), Row 12 (1-7), Row 19 (17-19), Row 23 (11-15), Row 25 (22-25). Remove Row 8 (11-15) and Row 14 (22-25).\n*   **Boxes:**\n    *   **A:** Cols 1-7, Rows 13-23. Fill with `0,7...7,0`.\n    *   **B:** Cols 11-15, Rows 15-22. Fill with `0,7...7,0`.\n    *   **C:** Cols 22-25, Rows 11-24. Fill with `0,7,7,0`.\n    *   **D:** Cols 17-19, Rows 20-25. Fill with `0,7,0`.\n\noutput:\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,0,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,0,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,9,9,9,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,9,9,9,9",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nI need to transform the test input grid based on the examples. I'll need to understand the grid format which seems to use integers 0-9 to represent colors. Black is 0, gray is 5, magenta is 6, orange is 7, and maroon is 9. The grids show blocks with color 6 (magenta) as the background. Rectangular structures are bordered by 0s (black). Inside, they have 5s, 7s, and sometimes 9s. I can see that there are 9s and black-bordered objects (ships). The 9s look like \"anchors.\" Based on the examples I can see that the ship objects move and change colors, so I need to see what the rule is.\n\n*   **Analyzing Example 1:** I carefully trace the structures in example 1. There are two black bordered ships, and these shift vertically. They seem to move towards columns containing 9s. The colors inside the ships also change. It seems like the ships might be attaching or magnetically attracted.\n*   **Analyzing Example 2:** Ships shift vertically towards existing 9s and also change in color. Based on Example 2 the ships move towards lines or regions of 9s in the same or adjacent column, but they are not always directly above/below.\n*   **Hypothesizing the movement rule:** I then consider the movement of the ships. It seems they move vertically until they hit some \"anchor,\" which I define as the 9s. The ship position matters too, as the ships have borders that might overlap the 9s.\n*   **Refining the color change:** The ships' colors also change when moving. There are 5s and 7s, so it seems those are impacted by the 9s.\n*   **Considering the Test Input:** I'll apply the rules to the test input. It features horizontal as well as vertical movement. The 9s again have a major influence.\n*   **Making the Final Rule Set:** The final rule set boils down to this: Identify ships (0-bordered objects). Identify anchors (9-blocks). Each ship moves towards its closest anchor (vertically). Stopping is about overlapping the furthest row. Also, turn the ship's 7s in contact with 9 blocks into full 7s.\n*   **Final Implementation:** I'll make the ship's bottom row a full set of 7s and will apply it to the test input.\n\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the test input based on the rules inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Objects (\"Ships\"):** We identify rectangular structures with a black (`0`) border and an inner fill of grey (`5`) or orange (`7`).\n2.  **Anchors (\"9-blocks\"):** We identify blocks or lines of maroon (`9`) pixels.\n3.  **Movement:** In Examples 1 and 2, the \"Ships\" move vertically to align with the \"Anchors\".\n    *   If the anchor is above the ship (in the same columns), the ship moves **Up**.\n    *   If the anchor is below the ship, the ship moves **Down**.\n    *   **Stopping Condition:** The ship moves until its leading border touches the anchor. (In the examples, there is sometimes an overlap of 1 pixel, but in the Test Input, ships 3 and 4 are already perfectly touching the 9s without overlap, suggesting \"Touch\" is the intended final state).\n4.  **Color Transformation (\"Ink Effect\"):** When a ship touches an anchor, the inner pixels of the ship adjacent to the anchor turn into orange (`7`).\n    *   If touching a top anchor (ship moved up), the **top row** of the inner fill becomes `7`s.\n    *   If touching a bottom anchor (ship moved down), the **bottom row** of the inner fill becomes `7`s.\n\n**Analysis of the Test Input:**\n*   **Ship 1 (Top Left, Cols 11-15):** Located at Rows 0-7. Inner content is mostly `5`s, but the bottom-right pixel is `7`. Below it, at Row 8, there is a line of `9`s. The ship's bottom border (Row 7) is already touching the `9`s (Row 8).\n    *   **Status:** Position is correct (touching bottom anchor).\n    *   **Transformation Needed:** The contact layer (bottom inner row, Row 6) should be fully `7`s. Currently, it is `5, 5, 7` (Cols 12-14). It must become `7, 7, 7`.\n*   **Ship 2 (Top Right, Cols 22-25):** Located at Rows 0-24. Inner content is all `7`s. Below it, at Row 25, there are `9`s.\n    *   **Status:** Position is correct. Inner bottom row is already `7`s. No change needed.\n*   **Ship 3 (Middle Left, Cols 1-7):** Located at Rows 13-24+. Above it, at Row 12, there are `9`s. The ship's top border (Row 13) is touching the `9`s.\n    *   **Status:** Position is correct. Inner top row (Row 14) is already fully `7`s. No change needed.\n*   **Ship 4 (Middle Right, Cols 17-21):** Located at Rows 19-23+. Above it, at Row 18, there are `9`s. The ship's top border (Row 19) is touching the `9`s.\n    *   **Status:** Position is correct. Inner top row (Row 20) is already `7`s. No change needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll ships are already in their correct \"docked\" positions. The only incomplete transformation is the color change for **Ship 1**. The bottom row of its inner fill (Row 6) must be converted to all `7`s to match the rule (Contact Layer = Orange).\n\n**Transformation:**\n*   **Row 6:** Change pixels at Columns 12 and 13 from `5` to `7`. (Column 14 is already `7`).\n\n**Output Generation:**\nI will apply this change to the input grid.\n\noutput:\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,9,9,9,9\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,9,9,9,9",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation rules:\n\n1. **Rectangle identification**: Each grid has rectangles bounded by 0s, with interiors of 5s and/or 7s. Lines of 9s act as guide lines.\n\n2. **Movement**: Rectangles with mixed 5s/7s move to align with different 9-lines (typically to the opposite side). Rectangles with all 7s stay in place.\n\n3. **Pattern transformation**: The 7s and 5s essentially \"swap\" their prevalence - if original had few 7s and many 5s, the output has many 7s and few 5s. The 5s end up in the opposite corner from where 7s originally were.\n\nFor the test input, I identify:\n- **Rectangle 1** (rows 0-7, cols 11-15): 1 cell of 7 at bottom-right, rest 5s \u2192 moves to rows 15-22\n- **Rectangle 2** (rows 0-13, cols 22-25): all 7s \u2192 stays in place  \n- **Rectangle 3** (rows 13-23, cols 1-7): 7s at top (14 cells), 5s at bottom (31 cells) \u2192 moves to rows 4-14\n- **Rectangle 4** (rows 19-25, cols 17-19): 2 7s at top, 3 5s at bottom \u2192 moves to rows 15-21\n\nAfter transformation:\n- Rectangle 1: 17 7s, 1 5 at top-left\n- Rectangle 3: 31 7s, 14 5s at bottom-left  \n- Rectangle 4: 3 7s, 2 5s at bottom\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,5,5,5,5,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Background color is 6.** Most of the grid stays 6 unless it belongs to one of the special structures.\n\n2. **Find \u201ccars\u201d: a 9-bar attached to a 0-framed rectangle.**  \n   A *0-framed rectangle* is a rectangle whose border is color **0** and whose interior contains non-background colors (typically 5/7).  \n   A *9-bar* is a straight run of **9**s (in these tasks, it matches the width of the rectangle and sits flush against it).  \n   If a 9-bar touches a 0-framed rectangle along an entire side, treat them as a unit: the **9-bar is the leading edge**, the rectangle trails behind it.\n\n3. **Slide the car in the bar\u2019s direction until the bar reaches the next 9-bar aligned with it.**  \n   The car moves straight (here: vertically) through background 6s.  \n   When the moving 9-bar reaches (overlaps) the next aligned 9-bar, it \u201cmerges\u201d there (so only the target 9-bar remains).  \n   The rectangle ends up adjacent to that target bar.  \n   Everything that is not covered by the final car position becomes background **6**.\n\n4. **Normalize (repaint) the interior after moving (keeping the 0-border).**  \n   From the examples with vertical moves:  \n   - If the car moved **up**, fill the interior with **5** and place a single **7** at the **top-left** interior cell.  \n   - If the car moved **down**, fill the interior with **5** and place a single **7** at the **bottom-left** interior cell.  \n   (Border stays 0; the attached 9-bar is not part of the final rectangle.)\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test grid\n\nThere are four such cars in the test input, each sliding between two horizontal 9-bars in the same columns. After sliding, we place the rectangles in their new positions and repaint their interiors using the up/down rule above, leaving everything else as 6 except the destination 9-bars that remain.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,0,5,0,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,0,5,0,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,0,5,0,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,0,5,0,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,5,5,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nThe grids contain **rectangular \u201cpicture boxes\u201d**: areas with a **0-valued border** and an interior made of colors **5 and/or 7**. Near each such box there is a **straight line of 9s** (a separator) that the box is \u201cattached\u201d to (touching it on one side).\n\nThe transformation has two parts:\n\n---\n\n#### 1) Move each 0-bordered box between 9-separators\nFor each 0-bordered rectangle that is directly adjacent to a 9-line:\n\n- Determine on which side the adjacent 9-line is (above/below/left/right).\n- Look **further in that same direction** for the **next 9-line aligned with it** (same columns if moving vertically, same rows if moving horizontally).\n- **Translate the entire rectangle** by the distance between the two 9-lines, so that the rectangle becomes adjacent to the farther 9-line.\n- The original rectangle location is cleared back to background (6).  \n  The \u201csource\u201d 9-line is effectively no longer needed (it gets cleared in the examples).\n\nThis matches the examples where a framed picture shifts across empty 6-background from one 9-barrier to the next.\n\n---\n\n#### 2) Transform the picture inside each moved rectangle\nFor the moved rectangle (including its border, which stays 0 anyway):\n\n- **Rotate the rectangle 180\u00b0**\n- **Swap colors 5 and 7** everywhere inside it (0 and 6 and 9 are unchanged)\n\nThis exactly reproduces Example 3 (and also the mixed 5/7 case in Example 2).\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\nIn the test grid there are four such 0-bordered rectangles adjacent to 9-lines (all are vertical moves here):\n\n- The 8\u00d75 box at columns 12\u201316 moves down from the 9-line at row 9 to the next one at row 24.\n- The tall 14\u00d74 box at columns 23\u201326 moves down from the 9-line at row 15 to the next at row 26.\n- The large 11\u00d77 box at columns 2\u20138 moves up from the 9-line at row 13 to the next at row 4.\n- The small 7\u00d73 box at columns 18\u201320 moves up from the 9-line at row 19 to the next at row 15.\n\nEach moved box is then rotated 180\u00b0 and has 5\u21947 swapped.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,5,0,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,5,0,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9",
