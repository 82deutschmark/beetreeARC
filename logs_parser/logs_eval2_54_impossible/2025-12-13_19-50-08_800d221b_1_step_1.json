        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the task is to predict the output of an ARC problem based on a few examples and a test input. I need to figure out the underlying logic. The grid sizes are the first thing I notice \u2013 16x16 in the examples, and a larger 30x30 test case. Colors are important, and I see distinct 'wall', 'background', and 'pattern' colors. My initial thought is to analyze the relationship between input and output, looking for changes in these colors and their positions.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis: Identifying the Pattern**\n\nIn Example 1, there's a clear 'wall' color (8, teal/light blue) that partitions the grid into regions. Inside these regions, I find repeating 'pattern' colors (3, 4) arranged in specific patterns. The output seems to alter the 'walls' and the regions they enclose.  The walls are either removed or changed, and the regions' content seem to propagate out. I'm focusing on connected regions \u2013 areas where the 'pattern' colors are touching each other, excluding walls and background. It's like a set of \"rooms\" with patterns inside and walls in between. I start by focusing on simple rectangular areas, tracing the lines of color 8.\n\n**Initial Hypothesis: Regional Expansion**\n\nMy first hypothesis is that the 'walls' take on the dominant color of the 'pattern' within their corresponding region. I start looking at coordinates and patterns, trying to identify rules for how the wall color changes. I see that the color of 8s is changed into the dominant color of the adjacent pixels.\n\n**Refining the Hypothesis: Majority Color and Edge Cases**\n\nAfter looking more carefully at Example 2, the 'walls' turn into the adjacent 'pattern' colors. I realize it is not the adjacent wall pixels that matter, but the internal pixels (dominant color). I now suspect it is a \"Majority Color\" rule: the 'walls' change to the most frequent color within the enclosed or adjacent 'pattern' region.\n\n**Testing the Theory and Dealing with Complex Regions**\n\nIn Example 3, 'walls' are separated by two different regions. I am now realizing that it works at the pixel level.  The \"conflict\" is solved at individual pixels within a wall. So now the wall does not change monolithically, it changes by the adjacent majority colors.\n\n**Algorithm Design and Edge Case Analysis**\n\nMy refined algorithm looks like this:\n\n1.  Identify the 'Background' color (usually the most common).\n2.  Identify the 'Wall' color (the lines separating regions).\n3.  Everything else is a 'Pattern'.\n4.  Find connected components of 'Pattern' colors.\n5.  Find connected components of 'Wall' pixels.\n6.  Match Wall components to Pattern components. The Wall changes to the Majority color.\n    A wall pixel belongs to a pattern group if it is next to a pattern pixel.\n\n**Applying the Algorithm to the Test Input**\n\nFor the test input (30x30), I quickly identify 'wall' color (4), then determine 'background' (6), and 'patterns' (3, 2). The goal now is to map 'wall' pixels to 'pattern' zones and apply the majority color rule. I go row by row and column by column and test whether they touch existing groups. I am seeing two main regions - one with 3, one with 2.\n\n**Test Case Analysis**\n\nNow, I analyze the 'wall' structure created by the color 4. I identify several connected components, including horizontal and vertical lines. I also start to analyze how each piece of this \"wall\" structure connects to the pattern regions. There are regions with a majority of 3 and regions with a majority of 2. I have a major \"conflict\" situation here - some 4s might touch both zones, and 4s need to become 2 or 3. It's becoming obvious that I have to examine each pixel very closely. I need to make sure each pixel becomes the right color in the end. I am assuming a 4-connectivity rule between wall pixels.\n\n**Final Solution**\nBased on this analysis, I will apply the logic of my algorithm to the specific grid structure. I am now working out the majority-propagation scheme for all the 'wall' pixels, taking into account any 'conflict' or ambiguous pixel locations. Now I will build my prediction.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by replacing the \"wall\" pixels with the dominant color of the adjacent pattern region.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Background Color:** 6 (Light Magenta/Pink). It fills the large empty areas.\n- **Wall Color:** 4 (Yellow). It forms the grid lines and boundaries.\n- **Pattern Regions:**\n    1.  **Top-Left Region (Rows 0-8, Cols 0-8):** Contains 3s (Green) and 2s (Red). The majority color is **3**.\n    2.  **Top-Right Small Region (Rows 3-6, Cols 26-29):** Enclosed by 4s. Contains 2s and 3s. The majority color is **2**.\n    3.  **Bottom-Right Region (Rows 21-29, Cols 15-29):** Contains 2s and 3s. The majority color is **2**.\n    4.  **Bottom-Left Region (Rows 22-25, Cols 0-2):** Contains 3s and 2s. The majority color is **3**.\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\n- Identify connected components of the wall (4s).\n- For each component (or part of a component), determine which Pattern Region it borders.\n- Change the color of the wall pixels to the majority color of that Pattern Region.\n- If a wall connects two different regions (e.g., the bar at Row 14 connecting Left-3 and Right-2), split the wall color based on proximity (left half becomes 3, right half becomes 2).\n- Isolated wall segments surrounded by background (6) that are part of a larger structure take the color of that structure.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n- **Top-Left Walls:** The horizontal line at Row 9 (Cols 0-9) and vertical line at Col 9 are adjacent to the 3-region. **Change 4 to 3.**\n- **Top-Right Enclosure:** The box at Cols 26-29 (Rows 3-6) encloses the 2-region. **Change 4 to 2.**\n- **Bottom-Right Walls:** The line at Row 20 (Cols 15-29) and vertical line at Col 14 are adjacent to the 2-region. **Change 4 to 2.**\n- **Bottom-Left Walls:** The vertical line at Col 2 and surroundings in Rows 21-25 enclose the 3-region. **Change 4 to 3.**\n- **Middle Connections:**\n    - Vertical line at Col 5 (Rows 10-13) connects to the Top-Left 3-system. **Change 4 to 3.**\n    - Vertical line at Col 12 (Rows 9-22) connects to the Bottom-Right 2-system. **Change 4 to 2.**\n    - Horizontal bar at Row 14 (Cols 9-14) connects the Left (3) and Right (2) systems. We split it: Left half (9,10,11) becomes **3**, Right half (12,13,14) becomes **2**.\n    - Horizontal bar at Row 16 (Cols 6-9) connects to Col 9 (3-system). **Change 4 to 3.**\n    - Vertical line at Col 6 (Rows 16-22) connects to the Bottom-Left 3-system. **Change 4 to 3.**\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n- **R0-8:** Wall at Col 9 becomes 3. Walls at Top-Right (C26-29) become 2. Vertical walls at C14, C22 become 2.\n- **R9:** C0-9 becomes 3. C12, C14 become 2.\n- **R10-13:** C5, C9 become 3.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Strategy for ARC Task: Image Inpainting**\n\nOkay, the user wants me to solve this tricky ARC problem! My initial thought is, this seems like a pattern completion or image inpainting task. I have three examples and a test input to work from. Let's break down the examples.\n\n**Example 1** seems like a \"collage\" or \"repair\" job where there are some corrupted image patches with some clean blocks. The key is that it seems to use the clean blocks to fill in the corrupted areas. The walls between them are like separators or noise. From this, the strategy should be to identify a repeating pattern and replace the noisy elements with their pattern counterparts to inpaint the images.\n\nThen I look at **Example 2**, and it seems to reinforce the inpainting hypothesis, but this time with a cross-shaped separator. Again, it is important to replace the \"noise\" color and complete or tile the pattern.\n\n**Example 3** solidifies the need for the pattern completion. It is a very noisy image with walls, but the output is very clean and structured.\n\nThe **Test Input** has this repeating pattern and structure. It appears to be made up of tiles - a green tile and a red tile. The task is to \"complete\" the image across a horizontal boundary, which suggests pattern completion with a vertical split. The columns on the left contain green tiles, whereas the columns on the right are made of red tiles.\n\nSince there are only \"clean\" blocks in the image and some noisy \"walls\", let's identify the signal pattern to fill the gaps and make a full-sized clean image, using a periodicity of 9.\n\nSo my approach:\n1.  **Extract the clean green tile (TL) and red tile (BR).**\n2.  **Define a basic 9-pixel green pattern (G) from TL, and 9-pixel red pattern (R) from BR. I will handle the \"wall\" color 4 through modulo operations.**\n3.  **Create a 30x30 output image.**\n4.  **Fill the output image:**\n    *   Left side (cols 0-14): use the Green pattern $G$ and tile vertically.\n    *   Right side (cols 15-29): use the Red pattern $R$ and tile vertically.\n5.  **Use modulo 9 to ensure proper pattern continuity at each column.**\nThis should give a reasonably complete solution!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where the input grid contains \"clean\" pattern patches and large areas of \"noise\" or \"empty\" space (walls and background). We need to reconstruct the full image based on the available clean patterns.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n- **Example 1:** The input contains 4x4 patches of a specific texture (3s and 4s) in the corners. The rest of the grid is filled with noise (8s) and background (9s). The output preserves the clean patches and fills the noise/walls with the pattern, effectively inpainting the grid. The background (9s) is preserved.\n- **Example 2:** The input has regions separated by \"noise\" walls (5s). Some regions are empty (0s), some are filled with a pattern (1s and 2s). The solution propagates the pattern into the noise walls and empty regions where appropriate, respecting the boundaries.\n- **Test Input:** The grid is 30x30.\n    - There are \"walls\" of color 4 and 6 separating the grid.\n    - There is a clean patch of \"Green Pattern\" (colors 3 and 2, mostly 3) in the Top-Left (TL) corner (rows 0-8, cols 0-8).\n    - There is a clean patch of \"Red Pattern\" (colors 2 and 3, mostly 2) in the Bottom-Right (BR) corner (rows 21-29, cols 21-29).\n    - The rest of the grid is filled with noise (4s and 6s) or partially corrupted data (Bottom-Left).\n    - The grid structure implies a vertical split at column 15. The left side (cols 0-14) seems to correspond to the Green Pattern, and the right side (cols 15-29) to the Red Pattern.\n\n**Solution Logic:**\n1.  **Extract Patterns:**\n    - Extract the 9x9 Top-Left patch ($P_G$) from the input (rows 0-8, cols 0-8). This is the source for the Green Pattern.\n    - Extract the 9x9 Bottom-Right patch ($P_R$) from the input (rows 21-29, cols 21-29). This is the source for the Red Pattern.\n\n2.  **Define Filling Strategy:**\n    - The grid is treated as a tiling or periodic extension of these patches. The walls (index 9, 20) suggest a periodicity of roughly 10, or simply that the 9x9 pattern repeats. Given the seamless reconstruction in Example 1, we will tile the 9x9 patterns using modulo arithmetic.\n    - **Left Half (Cols 0-14):** Filled with the Green Pattern $P_G$.\n      - $Output(r, c) = P_G[r \\pmod 9, c \\pmod 9]$.\n    - **Right Half (Cols 15-29):** Filled with the Red Pattern $P_R$.\n      - To align the pattern correctly so that the source block at $(21, 21)$ is reproduced faithfully, we shift the coordinates.\n      - $Output(r, c) = P_R[(r - 21) \\pmod 9, (c - 21) \\pmod 9]$.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    - Iterate through every cell $(r, c)$ of the 30x30 output grid.\n    - If $c < 15$, use the pixel from $P_G$.\n    - If $c \\ge 15$, use the pixel from $P_R$.\n\n**Patterns:**\n$P_G$ (9x9):\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n```\n\n$P_R$ (9x9):\n```\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3",

Boundaries at intersections are preserved.\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```",

Identify the **background** = most frequent color in the grid (in the examples this is 9, 0, 8; in the test it is 6).\n2. Identify the **boundary/fill color** = the color that forms paths/frames between regions and is the one recolored in the outputs (in the examples: 8, 5, 7; in the test it is 4).\n3. The **seed colors** are all colors except `{background, boundary}` (in the test these are 2 and 3).\n4. Consider the graph made of only the **boundary-color cells** (4-connected adjacency).\n5. For every boundary cell, compute the shortest-path distance **within this boundary graph** to the nearest boundary cell that is adjacent (4-neighbor) to a seed color:\n   - distance to seed-color 2 territory\n   - distance to seed-color 3 territory\n6. Recolor each boundary cell:\n   - If distance-to-2 < distance-to-3 \u21d2 change boundary cell to **2**\n   - If distance-to-3 < distance-to-2 \u21d2 change boundary cell to **3**\n   - If the distances are equal \u21d2 **leave it as the boundary color** (this produces the \u201cwatershed\u201d line that stays unchanged, like the remaining 5/7/8 in the examples)\n\nAll non-boundary cells are copied unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test grid\n- Background = **6**\n- Boundary/fill color = **4**\n- Seeds = **2** and **3**\n- Recolor all 4\u2019s by nearest-seed distance along the connected 4-network, keeping ties as 4.\n\nThis yields the following output grid:\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nAcross the examples, one color acts like a large \u201cbuffer/unknown\u201d region (Example1: `8`, Example2: `5`, Example3: `7`). That buffer is recolored by *spreading* the other (non-background) colors into it, like a Voronoi fill constrained to move only through the buffer cells.\n\nA precise way to reproduce the outputs:\n\n1. **Find the background color** = the most frequent color in the grid.  \n   This stays unchanged and does *not* spread.\n2. **Find the fillable/buffer color** = the second most frequent color in the grid.  \n   This is the only color that may change.\n3. Consider all remaining colors (everything except background and buffer) as **seed colors**. They stay fixed.\n4. For each cell of the **buffer color**, determine which seed color reaches it first by a **multi-source BFS** that:\n   - Moves in **4 directions** (up/down/left/right).\n   - Moves **only through buffer-color cells**.\n   - Starts from every buffer cell that is adjacent (4-neigh) to a seed cell, tagged with that seed\u2019s color.\n5. **Recolor** each buffer cell to the winning seed color.\n   - If two different seed colors reach a buffer cell at the **same minimum distance**, **leave it as the buffer color** (this creates the remaining buffer-color \u201cwatershed\u201d cells seen in the examples).\n6. All non-buffer cells remain unchanged.\n\nFor the test grid:\n- Background (most common) is `6`\n- Buffer (second most common) is `4`\n- Seed colors are `{2, 3}`\nSo we spread `2` and `3` into the `4`-cells, leaving `6`, `2`, `3` unchanged, and keeping `4` only on exact ties.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2  \n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2  \n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2  \n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2  \n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2",
