        "Full raw LLM response": "**The ARC Task: A Flood-Fill with a Twist**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to solve these ARC puzzles. It looks like they want me to do a flood-fill operation, but the rules are a little hidden. I\u2019m seeing patterns in the examples \u2013 shapes and then a filled version of those shapes in the output. My first instinct is to look at the differences between the input and output grids.\n\nI noticed a key: there are specific pixels in the input, which I'm calling \"legend\" or \"key,\" that seem to dictate the fill color. The core idea is this: if there\u2019s a closed area (a loop or shape) in the input, I need to fill it with a particular color. But what color? That's the trick.\n\nIt looks like the fill color isn't just random. It's related to a \u201cmarker\u201d pixel, usually a single instance of a color, adjacent to, or inside a simple structure, like a 2x2 with another color. In Example 1, I saw this 1 and 7 next to each other in the last row. So I made a hypothesis: there is a specific pixel configuration which acts as a key for the fill color.\n\nAfter looking at multiple examples, I came up with a hypothesis: It's all about finding these \"paint bucket\" pixels, identifying the fill color. The rule appears to be: find a small grouping of pixels, where one is the fill color, next to other color or forming a specific structure like a small 2x2. Closed shapes *not* of the background color are filled with the color indicated by the \"paint bucket.\"\n\nTo solve the test input, I need to find the paint buckets. First, I identify the background which is mostly 5. The rule, therefore, will be to fill 5s within loops. The paint bucket consists of the unique colors: 6 and 8. The shapes created by 9 will be filled. So I need to trace and map the regions, connected to the marker pixels. I identified two patterns: a 2x2 with 6 and 1 on the top left, and a shape with 8, and 3 at the top right.\n\nTherefore I construct the solution based on these fills, applying them to the appropriate regions. All I need to do is apply that in reverse for a final answer.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid by identifying closed regions (loops) and filling them with a specific color. The background color of the grid is 5 (gray).\n\n**Rules inferred from examples:**\n1.  **Identify Legend/Marker:** There are unique \"marker\" configurations in the grid that associate a specific border color or connection with a \"fill color\".\n    -   In the examples, a specific fill color (like 7 or 4) appears as a single pixel or inside a small \"bucket\" structure (e.g., a 2x2 block of 1s containing a 7).\n    -   In the Test Input, there are two such markers:\n        -   Top Left (0,0): A `6` surrounded by `1`s (forming a `1,1 / 6,1` block). This links the connector color **1** to the fill color **6**.\n        -   Top Right (0,29): An `8` surrounded by `3`s (forming a `3,8 / 3,3` block). This links the connector color **3** to the fill color **8**.\n2.  **Identify Target Regions:** The grid contains closed loops made of `9`s (maroon). Inside these loops is the background color `5`.\n3.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    -   Find which connector color (`1` or `3`) touches each loop of `9`s.\n    -   If a loop touches `1`, fill its interior with `6`.\n    -   If a loop touches `3`, fill its interior with `8`.\n\n**Step-by-step application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Top Left Loop (Rows 2-5, Cols 3-6):**\n    -   The loop is made of `9`s.\n    -   It touches `1` at Row 2, Column 3.\n    -   Action: Fill the interior (Rows 3-4, Cols 4-5) with **6**.\n\n2.  **Top Right Loop (Rows 2-5, Cols 12-20):**\n    -   The loop is made of `9`s.\n    -   It touches `1` at Row 2, Column 12.\n    -   Action: Fill the interior (Rows 3-4, Cols 13-19) with **6**.\n\n3.  **Middle Left Loop (Rows 10-13, Cols 4-10):**\n    -   The loop is made of `9`s.\n    -   It touches `3` at Row 13, Columns 2-3.\n    -   Action: Fill the interior (Rows 11-12, Cols 5-9) with **8**.\n\n4.  **Middle Right Vertical Loop (Rows 11-21, Cols 15-17):**\n    -   This is a vertical tube of `9`s.\n    -   It touches `3` at Row 11, Column 18.\n    -   Action: Fill the interior (Rows 12-20, Column 16) with **8**.\n\n5.  **Bottom Left Loop (Rows 22-25, Cols 3-6):**\n    -   The loop is made of `9`s.\n    -   It touches `3` at Row 22, Columns 3 and 6-10.\n    -   Action: Fill the interior (Rows 23-24, Cols 4-5) with **8**.\n\n6.  **Bottom Right Loop (Rows 22-27, Cols 19-22):**\n    -   The loop is made of `9`s.\n    -   It touches `1` at Row 21, Columns 23-25.\n    -   Action: Fill the interior (Rows 22-26, Cols 20-21) with **6**.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\nStart with the input grid and apply the fills calculated above.\n\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment & Strategy**\n\nOkay, the task is to analyze examples of an ARC puzzle and develop an algorithm. The core seems to be identifying a \"source\" pixel that \"floods\" a region.  The key is that the source is connected to a \"wire\" that links it to other regions. My goal is to find the connection rules and predict the output for the test input. I will begin by carefully analyzing the provided examples to find these rules. I see that the size of grid, the background color, and the shapes are different each time, the goal is to determine the rule that will yield a predicted output.\n\n**Example Analysis**\n\nExample 1: I observe a pattern.  The input grid has \"hollow\" shapes and a bottom-right \"trigger.\" The inside of the shapes is modified in the output when connected by a \"wire\". There are closed loops defined by single colors, \"walls\", which can be outlines or boundaries. The \"wire\" appears to be color 1.\n\nI looked at the input carefully. There's a 7 at the bottom right that's *also* in the output. It's associated with a blue \"wire\". When this wire connects to shapes or intersects them, I see a color change. I'm focusing on the pixels adjacent to the \"wire\" and those within the shapes.\n\nI formulate a hypothesis: There's a \"source,\" a \"wire\" to trigger the process, and a \"wall\" to form the boundary of the shapes. Shapes connected by \"wires\" are filled with the source color in output.\n\nExample 2: The pattern continues. We have a \"source\" - a 4 at the bottom left. The wire is still 1. The enclosed shape now becomes 4 in the output. In this example, the wire passes through the shapes. So the rule is if any part of the wire touches the boundary, it fills the shape. If the wire can touch the walls, the interior of this shape will be changed to the same color.\n\nI'm starting to formalize the rule:  If the wire of a particular color connects a \"source\" to a \"closed region\" bordered by some color. That region fills with the color of the \"source.\"\n\nExample 3: Here, the wire color changed. Is this \"the color of the adjacent pixels\"? Now it's a 3-wire, connected to a 4 source. The fill still goes to 4. I note the wire color adjacent to the source is the actual \"wire.\" The rules hold!\n \n**Refining the Rule**\n\nAfter looking closely, I realize that the wire's pixel can replace the edge pixel on the shapes! It is important to remember the pixel values in each example.  It needs to be a \"closed region,\" where, in the last example, some of the shape boundaries touch wires.\n\nThe updated rule is: Identify source pixel S and wire color W. Trace the W pixels. If this W path touches an enclosed region surrounded by a boundary color, fill with the source color.  A wire can touch walls to conduct fill.\n\nI'm thinking: The wire pixels either sit inside the boundary, and is \"part of the wall\". I need to keep the wall pixel color in the fill operation. The wire \"conducts\" the fill color to any background (0 or 5).\n\nI need to make this general. I want to replace the inside, but not replace the walls themselves!\n\nThe rule: Source and wire are key. Any region surrounded by a boundary, 8-way adjacent to the wire, gets flooded by source.\n\nI need to confirm the direction. \"Active wires\" that link the sources and regions of the shapes are filled.  I need to add some details:\n\n1.  Find source pixel - unique color attached to a wire network.\n2.  Find wire color. Adjacent to the source.\n3.  Trace the connected component of the wire.\n4.  If the wire touches the boundary of a region, fill with the source color, including diagonally.\n\nI check Example 4, I add diagonal connections in my thoughts.\n\n**Test Input Analysis and Solution Plan**\n\nNow comes the moment of truth - the Test Input. First, I want to find the source. After searching I found 2 different options. There are two sources, a 6, and an 8. I will trace the paths.\n\nThere seems to be two independent networks (wire 1 and wire 3).  The shapes are still there, defined by the \"walls\" of color 9, and the interiors are now the background/wall color (5).\n\nNow I need to:\n\n1.  Find the wires and sources. Identify the components.\n2.  Map out all the 9-bounded shapes, and determine which ones are adjacent to wire.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I first analyzed the solved examples to understand the transformation rules.\n1.  **Identify Sources and Wires**: In each example, there are specific \"source\" pixels (unique colors) connected to a network of \"wire\" pixels (another specific color).\n    *   Example 1: Source 7 connected to Wire 1.\n    *   Example 2: Source 4 connected to Wire 1.\n    *   Example 3: Source 4 connected to Wire 3.\n    *   Test Input:\n        *   Source 6 (at top left, 0,0) is connected to a network of 1s (Wire 1).\n        *   Source 8 (at top right, 0,29) is connected to a network of 3s (Wire 3).\n\n2.  **Identify Shapes**: The grid contains \"hollow\" shapes defined by boundary pixels (walls). In the test input, the walls are primarily color 9, and the background/interior is color 5. We need to identify closed regions of 5s surrounded by 9s.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule**: For each closed shape, if its boundary (the 9s) is touched (8-way adjacency) by a specific wire network, the interior 5s are filled with the corresponding source color.\n    *   Shapes touched by Wire 1 (connected to Source 6) are filled with 6.\n    *   Shapes touched by Wire 3 (connected to Source 8) are filled with 8.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shape A (Top Left)**: Located at Rows 3-4, Cols 4-5.\n    *   Bounded by 9s.\n    *   Touched by Wire 1 (e.g., at Row 2, Col 3).\n    *   Action: Fill with 6.\n\n*   **Shape B (Top Middle)**: Located at Rows 3-4, Cols 13-19.\n    *   Bounded by 9s.\n    *   Touched by Wire 1 (e.g., at Row 2, Col 12).\n    *   Action: Fill with 6.\n\n*   **Shape C (Middle Left)**: Located at Rows 11-12, Cols 4-10.\n    *   Bounded by 9s.\n    *   Touched by Wire 3 (e.g., at Row 13, Col 3 touching the bottom wall).\n    *   Action: Fill with 8.\n\n*   **Shape D (Middle Vertical Strip)**: Located at Rows 13-20, Col 16.\n    *   Bounded by 9s (at Cols 15 and 17).\n    *   Touched by Wire 3 (e.g., at Row 21, Col 15 touching the bottom/side wall).\n    *   Action: Fill with 8.\n\n*   **Shape E (Bottom Left)**: Located at Rows 23-25, Cols 4-5.\n    *   Bounded by 9s.\n    *   Touched by Wire 3 (e.g., at Row 22, Col 3).\n    *   Action: Fill with 8.\n\n*   **Shape F (Bottom Right)**: Located at Rows 23-25, Cols 19-21.\n    *   Bounded by 9s.\n    *   Touched by Wire 1 (e.g., at Row 22, Col 22 touching the wall at Row 23, Col 22).\n    *   Action: Fill with 6.\n\nI will construct the output grid by applying these fills to the input grid.\n\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,5,5,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,9,5,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n1. **There is a \u201cbackground\u201d color** (in all examples it\u2019s `0`).\n2. The input contains **one special \u201cpaint\u201d color** that appears as a **single pixel** (in the examples it is `7` or `4`).  \n3. The output is the same as the input **except** that any **background-colored area that is fully enclosed** by non-background colors (i.e. a \u201chole\u201d) is **filled with the paint color**.\n   - Operationally: flood-fill the background color from the border. Any background cell **not reachable from the border** is inside an enclosure \u2192 recolor it with the paint color.\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n- The most common/border-filling color is **`5`**, so **background = 5**.\n- The grid has **two single-pixel paint colors**: `6` (top-left) and `8` (top-right).  \n  (Both are the unique corner pixels inside a 2\u00d72 block of another color, just like the examples\u2019 paint pixel.)\n- Find all **enclosed regions of `5`** (5-cells not connected to the border through 5s). There are six such holes, all enclosed by `9`s.\n- Since there are **two paint colors**, use the natural extension: **fill each hole with the paint color on its side** (closest corner marker). This yields:\n  - Left-side holes \u2192 fill with **`6`**\n  - Right-side holes \u2192 fill with **`8`**\n\n### Completed output grid\n\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,8,8,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Inference from the solved examples\n\nAcross the examples, the output is the same as the input **except** that some cells of the \u201cbackground\u201d color are recolored:\n\n1. **Identify the background color**: it is the color that occupies most of the grid (in the examples it is `0`).\n2. Consider all cells **not** equal to the background as \u201cwalls\u201d.\n3. Find all connected components (4-neighborhood) of the background color.\n   - The component that touches the outer border is the \u201coutside background\u201d and stays unchanged.\n   - Any background component **not touching the border** is a **hole/enclosed pocket**.\n4. The task fills each such enclosed pocket with a special \u201cpaint\u201d color given in the input (examples show a singleton paint color).\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n- The most frequent color is **`5`**, so background = `5`.\n- There are **two singleton paint colors on the border**: `6` (top-left) and `8` (top-right).\n- Find all enclosed `5`-regions (holes). In this grid there are 6 such enclosed regions.\n- Since there are two paint colors, fill each hole with the **nearest** paint color (Manhattan distance); this cleanly separates left-side holes (filled with `6`) from right-side holes (filled with `8`).\n\n### Output grid\n\n6,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,8\n1,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3\n5,5,5,1,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,5,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,5,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,1,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,3,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,9,3,3,5,5,9,8,8,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,8,8,9,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,3,3,9,9,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,0,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,8,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5,5\n5,5,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,1,1,1,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,9,1,1,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,9,6,6,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",
