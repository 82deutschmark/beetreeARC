My immediate thought is to dissect these examples and identify the underlying rules. It's clear that the output is always a 20x20 grid, but the inputs vary in size, which suggests some kind of tiling or resizing operation.\n\nMy initial analysis involves breaking down the structure of each example.  I'm looking for relationships between input size and output size, the colors used, and any discernible patterns in how the input data is mapped to the output. Example 1 has me thinking about a basic pasting of the input in the top left corner. However, this is quickly disrupted as Example 4 shows a displacement.\n\nA crucial observation emerges: the *location* of the input within the output is not fixed. Sometimes it's in the top-left, sometimes not. This hints at a more dynamic transformation, possibly related to some periodic or repeating structure. I start to entertain the possibility of an infinite grid or a torus where the input is merely a window.\n\nThe \"Examples\" are leading me down a rabbit hole.  I now have the task of deriving how the input pattern relates to the output pattern. I need to extrapolate. The Test Input is 11x10. I hypothesize that this Test Input fits in the center.\n\nBased on an observation from example 4, I assume the \"test input\" window fits at the center. I hypothesize this \"Test Input\" window is a crop or section of a grid, then tile it.\n\nSo I am now testing this hypothesis, and based on the nature of the test input. I now tile the input with a 2x2.\n\nThis should generate the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a test input grid into an output grid based on five solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Output Size:** In all five examples, the output grid size is consistently **20x20**, regardless of the input size (which varies: 8x10, 16x8, 10x10, 13x12, 8x10).\n2.  **Pattern Relationship:** The input grid acts as a \"seed\" or a \"window\" into a larger repeating pattern that fills the 20x20 output grid.\n    *   In **Example 1** (Input 8x10), the input matches the top-left corner of the output.\n    *   In **Example 3** (Input 10x10), the input matches the top-left corner.\n    *   In **Example 4** (Input 13x12), the input is found starting at row 2, column 0 of the output.\n    *   In **Example 5** (Input 8x10), the input is found at the bottom-right of the output (starting at row 12, column 10).\n3.  **Tiling Logic:** The most consistent transformation that explains the generation of the full 20x20 grid from a smaller rectangular input is **periodic tiling** (repeating the input grid).\n    *   Mathematically, this corresponds to mapping the output pixel at coordinate $(r, c)$ to the input pixel at $(r \\pmod H, c \\pmod W)$, where $H$ and $W$ are the height and width of the input grid.\n    *   Checking **Example 5**: Input 8x10. The input is at the bottom right. The pattern wraps around. For instance, Output row 0 matches Input row 4 ($0 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$? No, $12 \\pmod 8 = 4$. If Input starts at 12, then $y_{out}=12 \\to y_{in}=0$. So $y_{in} = (y_{out} - 12) \\pmod 8$. If we assume the underlying pattern is aligned such that $(0,0)$ of the pattern is $(0,0)$ of the input, then $O[r,c] = I[r \\pmod 8, c \\pmod{10}]$. Let's check Ex 5 Output(0,0). $I[0,0] = 8$. Output(0,0) is 8. Matches. This simple tiling works for Ex 5.\n    *   Checking **Example 1**: Input 8x10. $O[0,10]$ should be $I[0,0]=7$. Actual is 8. While there are some discrepancies/variations in Example 1, the other examples (especially 4 and 5) strongly suggest a tiling or sliding window mechanism. Given the Test Input has a strong diagonal texture (stripes of 5s and 6s), preserving this texture via tiling is the most logical deduction.\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\nThe output is a 20x20 grid generated by tiling the input grid.\n$Output[r, c] = Input[r \\pmod {Height}, c \\pmod {Width}]$\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   Input Size: 11 rows, 10 columns.\n*   Output Size: 20 rows, 20 columns.\n*   We will fill the output grid by copying the input grid.\n    *   Rows 0-10: Copy Input Rows 0-10.\n    *   Rows 11-19: Copy Input Rows 0-8 ($r \\pmod{11}$).\n    *   Cols 0-9: Copy Input Cols 0-9.\n    *   Cols 10-19: Copy Input Cols 0-9 ($c \\pmod{10}$).\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\nThe Input is:\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6\n```\n\nWe extend this to 20x20.\nRows 0-10, Cols 0-9: Identical to Input.\nRows 0-10, Cols 10-19: Identical to Input (since width is 10, col 10 maps to col 0).\nRows 11-19: Repeat rows starting from 0.\nRow 11 = Input Row 0\nRow 12 = Input Row 1\n...\nRow 19 = Input Row 8\n\nOutput Grid:\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n<REASONING_MODEL_C model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_4_step_3\">\nI inferred that the output is produced by **periodically tiling** the given input pattern to fill a fixed **20\u00d720** canvas:\n\n1.

Here's how my brain is working it through, step-by-step:\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the examples provided in the problem. I'm focusing on the input-output pairs and trying to see what kind of transformation is happening. The goal is to come up with a rule to transform the test input into the desired output.\n\nI start by looking at the dimensions of the input and output grids.  My initial thought is that it's a simple scaling, like doubling the size or something.  But, I quickly realize the scaling factor isn't a simple integer. I also noticed the number of colors in the grid is important. I read and re-read the hints provided very carefully. It helps but it also sometimes confuses me, as they have many hints.\n\nI'm trying to figure out if the input is simply a portion of a larger, pre-defined image. I'm looking for patterns, like repetition or rotation, between the input and output. The hint \"Large input 'wall' structures stay in place\" is key here. It suggests that certain parts of the input are preserved in the output, but in a modified form. This is the central clue.\n\nI'm trying to figure out if the output is just the input with some extra details added.  Maybe the extra details are generated by some rule? Maybe it's a fractal, a texture, a tiling pattern, something to fill the \"empty space\" within the output grid? I think that this seems plausible for the example, as the output seems to be more than a zoom or resize of the input.\n\nI get to a point where I think that the output is constructed by repeating the input (tiling), but this is not always true, as it does not work for all the examples. I now know that there is something more complex to the transformation. I realize that the examples have a relationship I need to find. \n\nI'm now thinking about how the provided input relates to what gets output. Is the input defining the entire grid, or is it a small part, and the task is to *complete* the output grid? This \"Input defines the logic\" theory is key.\n\nThen, there's the concept of \"Enclosed holes\" which are mentioned in the hints. This makes me suspect the solution involves identifying and treating these \"holes\" or enclosed regions specially. Maybe I should think about flood fills, where regions get filled with the same color, this is very important.\n\nI check different \"Wall Structures\" as mentioned in the hint. Then the Manhattan rule for generation which might create a tiling.\n\nThen I get to the key concept that the task is to replicate the structure, where the input is a texture (bricks, and lines, and colors) and I must generate the same structure, by repeating.\n\nThis leads me to think about the Test Input, which is now a pattern, and how to repeat the pattern. I try to apply this strategy to other examples to see if I am making progress.\nThen I conclude the following: for the given problem:\n1. Copy the Input into the Output\n2. Repeat horizontally, the Input values.\n3. Repeat the rows of the input in the vertical direction.\n\nI then check with this set of assumptions to see if this is consistent with the ARC logic and other examples. I convince myself the Tile operation is the correct logic. I then write my final response.\n\n\nTo solve the ARC task, I analyzed the provided examples and the test input.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Transformation Rule:** The task involves transforming a smaller input grid into a fixed-size 20x20 output grid.\n    *   **Scale/Position:** In Examples 1 and 3, the input grid is copied exactly into the top-left corner of the output grid.\n    *   **Content Extension:** The remaining area of the 20x20 grid (to the right and below the input) is filled with a pattern that extends the logic of the input.\n    *   **Example 1 vs Test Input:** Example 1 has an input with an \"Object\" (orange shape on azure background). The extension logic appears to generate a background with specific striped structures. The Test Input, however, resembles a \"Texture\" or \"Pattern\" (alternating bands/blocks of gray and magenta, like a brick wall).\n    *   **Texture Logic:** For inputs that are textured/periodic (like the Test Input), the most logical \"Manhattan/rectilinear\" extension is to **tile** or **repeat** the pattern to fill the larger grid. This preserves the \"dense rectilinear substructure\" and the \"wall structures\".\n\n2.  **Test Input Structure:**\n    *   Dimensions: 11x10.\n    *   Colors: 5 (Gray), 6 (Magenta).\n    *   Pattern: The rows show an alternating pattern of blocks (approx width 5).\n        *   Row 0: `6,6,6,6,6, 5,5,5,5,5` (Type A)\n        *   Row 1: `5,5,5,5,5, 5,6,6,6,6` (Type B - shifted)\n        *   Row 2: `6,6,6,5,6...` (Type A-ish)\n        *   The rows alternate roughly as A, B, A, B...\n    *   Target Output: 20x20.\n\n3.  **Construction of Output:**\n    *   **Top-Left Region (0-10, 0-9):** Copy the 11x10 Input exactly.\n    *   **Right Extension (0-10, 10-19):** To maintain the horizontal periodicity (5 blocks of 6, 5 blocks of 5, etc.), we repeat the input columns. Since the input width is 10 and the period seems to be 10 (or compatible with 10), copying Cols 0-9 to Cols 10-19 preserves the texture.\n    *   **Bottom Extension (11-19, 0-19):** To maintain the vertical alternation (A, B, A, B...), we need to append rows that follow the sequence. The input ends at Row 10 (Type B). The next row (11) should be Type A. Row 0 is Type A. Thus, we can fill Rows 11-19 by repeating the sequence starting from Row 0. We need 9 rows (11 to 19), so we copy Input Rows 0 to 8.\n\n**Conclusion:** The output is generated by tiling the input pattern. The 11x10 input is placed at (0,0). The right side (cols 10-19) is a horizontal repeat of the input. The bottom side (rows 11-19) is a vertical repeat of the input (using the first 9 rows to continue the alternating pattern).\n\n**Output Generation:**\n*   Rows 0-10: `[Input Row] + [Input Row]`\n*   Rows 11-19: `[Input Row (r-11)] + [Input Row (r-11)]`\n\nTest Input:\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6\n\nOutput Grid (20x20):\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_F>\n</CANDIDATE 3>\n<CANDIDATE 10>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 20x20\n66666555555555566666\n55555566666666555555\n66656666666666665666\n55556666666666665555\n55666666666666666655\n65666666666666666656\n55555666666666655555\n56655566666666555665\n56665556666665556665\n56666555666655566665\n56666655566555666665\n56666555666655566665\n56665556666665556665\n56655566666666555665\n55555666666666655555\n65666666666666666656\n55666666666666666655\n55556666666666665555\n66656666666666665666\n55555566666666555555\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n**Analysis of ARC Task and Test Input**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I need to figure out a transformation from an input grid to an output grid, and I have five example pairs to learn from, plus a test input. My first thought is to dive into the examples and try to spot any patterns.\n\nI start by looking at the dimensions of the grids and quickly realize that the output grid is always 20x20, while the inputs vary in size. That's a clue! My initial instinct is that it's a scaling operation, but that doesn't quite fit the varying input sizes. I start looking for relationships between the input and output's contents, suspecting a tiling or a rotated/flipped element to form the 20x20 output.\n\nI examine the pixel values (colors) within the input and output grids, looking for direct copies, rotations, or reflections. I try to match individual input rows/columns to the output, but it doesn't seem to be a straightforward one-to-one mapping. This makes me suspect the process isn't a simple pixelwise transformation but something more complex. I explore the idea of rotation, but the input and output sizes don't match, and the rotations don't align perfectly. I think about combinations, like tiling the input and then cropping the output but realize that also wouldn't explain the dimensions.\n\nI'm starting to think the output could be constructed by stitching together rotated or reflected copies of the input, but the arrangement is tricky. I start to wonder if there's a mathematical transformation involved, possibly a projection or wrap-around of some kind. I begin experimenting with linear transformations (rotations and translations) but encounter issues with getting them to consistently explain all the examples. I even consider edge cases and seamless tiling, and that doesn't work either.\n\nI shift my attention to the 'Test Input' with its diagonal element pattern, hoping it can guide me. Since the Output is 20x20, I assume that I'm supposed to find a 20x20 arrangement. Looking at Example 3, I am sure the \"repetition\" is important. I think about pattern completion or extension.  I recognize a potential mirror logic or tiling of the Test Input. This, combined with what I learned from Ex 1 with shifted tiles and horizontal reversal.\n\nSo, I decide to create the 20x20 from mirror operations. I build the output in blocks: TL is the input; TR is the horizontal reverse of the input; BL = Vertical mirror; BR = BL horizontally flipped. I can make it look seamless and preserve the textures. It's a nice pattern completion operation.\n\nAfter trying to map each pixel precisely, I accept the symmetry-based construction based on tiling and mirroring to be most robust. I apply these rules in the detailed plan, and create the final 20x20 output.\n\n\nThe transformation rule inferred from the examples, particularly taking into account the dimensions and the preservation of pattern continuity, is to expand the input grid into a 20x20 output grid using symmetry.\n\nThe specific logic for the Test Input (11x10) is:\n1.  **Horizontal Expansion**: The 10-column input is mirrored horizontally to create 20 columns. The left half (columns 0-9) is the original input. The right half (columns 10-19) is the horizontal reflection (reverse) of the input. This creates a seamless \"book-match\" symmetry across the vertical center line.\n2.  **Vertical Expansion**: The 11-row input serves as the top portion of the grid. To fill the remaining 9 rows (to reach height 20), the grid reflects vertically around the bottom row (Row 10). Row 11 is a copy of Row 9, Row 12 is a copy of Row 8, and so on, down to Row 19 which is a copy of Row 1. This creates a symmetry where the \"fold\" is at Row 10.\n\nThis transformation preserves the diagonal structures and the block patterns found in the input, creating a coherent 20x20 pattern.\n\n**Output Grid Calculation:**\n\n*   **Row 0:** Original `6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5` + Reverse `5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6`\n*   **Row 1:** Original `5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5`\n*   **Row 2:** Original `6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6`\n*   **Row 3:** Original `5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5`\n*   **Row 4:** Original `5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5`\n*   **Row 5:** Original `6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6`\n*   **Row 6:** Original `5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5`\n*   **Row 7:** Original `5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5`\n*   **Row 8:** Original `5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5`\n*   **Row 9:** Original `5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5`\n*   **Row 10:** Original `5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6` + Reverse `6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5`\n*   **Row 11:** Copy of Row 9\n*   **Row 12:** Copy of Row 8\n*   **Row 13:** Copy of Row 7\n*   **Row 14:** Copy of Row 6\n*   **Row 15:** Copy of Row 5\n*   **Row 16:** Copy of Row 4\n*   **Row 17:** Copy of Row 3\n*   **Row 18:** Copy of Row 2\n*   **Row 19:** Copy of Row 1\n\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1.

The position varies:\n    *   Example 1 (8x10 input): Placed at (0,0).\n    *   Example 2 (16x8 input): Placed at (0,6).\n    *   Example 4 (13x12 input): Placed at (2,0).\n    *   Example 5 (8x10 input): Placed at (12,10).\n    The placement seems to maximize the symmetry of the resulting grid, often aligning corners or centers. For the test input (11x10), the corner colors (6, 5, 5, 6) suggest a point-symmetric arrangement rooted at the corners. This implies the input should be placed at **(0,0)**.\n3.  **Pattern Completion:**\n    *   In Examples 2 and 4, the output grid exhibits **Point Symmetry** (180-degree rotation symmetry) around the center of the 20x20 grid (coordinate 9.5, 9.5).\n    *   This means `Output[r, c] == Output[19-r, 19-c]`.\n    *   The missing regions are filled to maintain this symmetry and local continuity (reflection/mirroring).\n    *   Specifically, for inputs placed at the Top-Left, the Top-Right quadrant is often a Horizontal Reflection of the Top-Left, and the Bottom-Left is a Vertical Reflection, creating a cohesive pattern.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Placement:** Place the 11x10 Test Input at the top-left corner `(0,0)` of the 20x20 output grid.\n    *   `Output[0..10][0..9]` is filled with the Input.\n2.  **Symmetry (Bottom-Right):** Apply Point Symmetry to fill the Bottom-Right region.\n    *   `Output[19-r][19-c] = Output[r][c]`.\n    *   This fills rows 9-19, columns 10-19.\n3.  **Completion (Top-Right):** Fill the Top-Right quadrant `(0..9, 10..19)` by mirroring the Top-Left horizontally.\n    *   `Output[r][c] = Output[r][19-c]`.\n    *   Input column 9 (`5,6...`) is adjacent to column 10. Mirroring creates a smooth transition if the edge is a symmetry axis or repeats. Given the blocky nature of 5s and 6s, mirroring is the standard completion here.\n4.  **Completion (Bottom-Left):** Fill the Bottom-Left quadrant `(11..19, 0..9)` by mirroring the Top-Left vertically.\n    *   `Output[r][c] = Output[19-r][c]`.\n    *   Or derived via Point Symmetry from the Top-Right.\n\n**Step-by-Step Construction:**\n*   **Rows 0-10, Cols 0-9:** Input data.\n*   **Rows 0-10, Cols 10-19:** Horizontal Mirror of Input (Col 0 maps to 19, Col 9 maps to 10).\n    *   Example: `Output[0][10] = Input[0][9]`.\n*   **Rows 11-19, Cols 0-19:** Vertical Mirror of the generated top half (Row 0 maps to 19, Row 8 maps to 11).\n    *   `Output[r][c] = Output[19-r][c]`.\n\n**Refinement on Rows 0-10 vs 0-8:**\nThe input has 11 rows. Mirroring vertically around the center (9.5) means `Row 19` mirrors `Row 0`, `Row 10` mirrors `Row 9`.\nSince `Row 10` is provided in the input, we must check if it matches the mirror of `Row 9`.\nInput R9: `5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6`. Mirror R9 (from Horizontal Mirror step): `6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5`.\nInput R10: `5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6`.\nThey are not identical, but the prompt says \"Input is copied exactly\". Thus, we keep Input R10 as is. For the remaining empty rows (11-19), we mirror the top rows (8 down to 0).\n\n**Final Algorithm:**\n1.  Copy Input to `(0,0)`.\n2.  Fill `Cols 10-19` for `Rows 0-10` by mirroring `Cols 0-9`.\n3.  Fill `Rows 11-19` by mirroring `Rows 8-0` (since Row 9 is the center-adjacent row, Row 10 is the \"extra\" past center, so Row 11 mirrors Row 8).\n\nOutput Grid:\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gemini-3-high_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n**Analyzing and Constructing a Solution for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I need to solve a grid-based problem using given examples. The core seems to involve generating a larger 20x20 output grid from a smaller input grid, with specific constraints.\n\nFirst, I looked at the examples: I examined the dimensions, colors, and spatial arrangements of the inputs and outputs. Immediately I saw the constant 20x20 output size, regardless of input dimensions. I tried to identify a direct scaling or tiling operation, but it didn't seem that straightforward.\n\nI noticed in example 1, the top-left corner of the output matches the input. Then, I dug into this, looking at how the input grid is arranged within the output grid. The outputs have repeating elements from inputs, but it is not a direct copy, as in Example 2. The input could have been rotated, or partially mirrored. So I tried to understand the hint \"Large input 'wall' structures stay in place\". This prompted me to re-examine the outputs, looking for structures that extend from the given input.\n\nI then started forming a new hypothesis: that the input grid is a window or portion of a larger pattern or texture, and my task is to complete the 20x20 grid by extending that pattern. The hint \"Manhattan/parity/layer-based logic\" reinforced this idea. This would involve recognizing patterns that exist and that the output is not just a direct replication. I started examining if the output is generated by a specific rule.\n\nAt this point, I needed to figure out how the input fits into the output. What's the relation? Should it go in the corner? Or in the middle? I found that by placing the input at different offset points in the 20x20 grid, I got matching regions of the output. I also realized from that process, it did not follow a simple scaling. Also, the inputs seem to be positioned in the corner. If I place it differently, there are no matches, as in Example 5. It seemed the rule could be that all inputs have to be the top-left.\n\nI spent time analyzing if this pattern is based on symmetries by identifying if the grid can be divided into identical chunks. I tried to figure out a generative rule to build the output. I looked at specific examples. I had to focus on the structure of the pattern, it has something to do with the \"walls\", \"holes\" and symmetry. It has something to do with filling the grid with something. My goal became to find the pattern and extrapolate.\n\nAfter a lot of trial and error, a plan crystallized: Given a top-left input corner (or some specific position determined by the input itself), the pattern needs to be extended. I decided to mirror the inputs in a way that makes sense. The central rule is that there is an existing structure that needs to be preserved and completed, in that order, while maintaining symmetry, as well as preserving the two colors. The symmetry preserves the structure. I identified that \"holes\" are filled with a specific texture, but that the structure is the most important part of the solution.\n\nThe key insight was to view the input as a \"patch\" that's used to define the 20x20 grid by some process, instead of direct tiling. Given all of the example, the \"most-likely\" placement of the input grid is at top-left. So, I will proceed with reflecting the input horizontally, and vertically, to complete the 20x20, using the mirror points to construct the correct output.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a smaller input grid into a fixed-size $20 \\times 20$ output grid. Based on the solved examples, we can observe the following patterns:\n\n1.  **Output Dimensions:** All example outputs are $20 \\times 20$, regardless of the input size (which varies, e.g., $8 \\times 10$, $16 \\times 8$, $10 \\times 10$).\n2.  **Input Retention:** The input grid appears to correspond to a specific region (crop) of the output grid. In Examples 1 and 3, the input is exactly the top-left corner of the output. In other examples, it corresponds to different alignments (e.g., matching solid borders).\n3.  **Pattern Extension & Symmetry:** The output grids exhibit symmetries. For instance, Example 3 (0s and 3s) shows a room-like structure where the walls and patterns seem to mirror or repeat. The hints suggest \"Manhattan/parity/layer-based logic\" and that \"Large input 'wall' structures stay in place\". This implies the input defines the \"seed\" or the \"walls\" of a larger structure.\n\nGiven the Test Input is $11 \\times 10$ and has a solid-looking right edge (Column 9 is almost entirely `6`s except the top corner), and the task is to generate a $20 \\times 20$ grid, the most robust reconstruction\u2014consistent with the \"rectilinear substructure\" and symmetry seen in examples\u2014is to treat the input as the **top-left quadrant** (or half) of a symmetric structure.\n\n**Construction Logic for the Test Input:**\n\n*   **Placement:** Place the $11 \\times 10$ input grid into the top-left corner of the $20 \\times 20$ output grid (Rows 0-10, Cols 0-9).\n*   **Horizontal Symmetry:** The right half of the output (Cols 10-19) is generated by mirroring the left half horizontally. Specifically, Col 10 is a copy of Col 9, Col 11 is Col 8, ..., Col 19 is Col 0. This creates a thick central wall from the solid column 9 of the input.\n*   **Vertical Symmetry:** The bottom half of the output (Rows 11-19) is generated by mirroring the top part. Since the input provides rows 0-10 (11 rows), and the output needs 20 rows, we treat the center as the \"seam\". A standard reflection for a 20-row grid would mirror 0-9 to 19-10. Here, we have row 10 provided. We will assume the structure mirrors around the provided center. A reflection of rows 0-8 filling rows 19-11 ensures the pattern continues smoothly, leaving rows 9 and 10 as the unique central band.\n    *   Row 11 becomes a copy of Row 8 (mirrored horizontally).\n    *   Row 12 becomes a copy of Row 7...\n    *   Row 19 becomes a copy of Row 0.\n\nThis approach preserves the input \"walls\" and generates the \"dense rectilinear substructure\" characteristic of the examples.\n\n**Test Input (11x10):**\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6\n```\n\n**Output Generation:**\n1.  **Top-Left (0-10, 0-9):** Copy Input.\n2.  **Top-Right (0-10, 10-19):** Mirror Input horizontally.\n    *   Row 0: `6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5` + `5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6`\n    *   ...\n3.  **Bottom (11-19, 0-19):** Mirror Top rows 0-8 vertically.\n    *   Row 11 is symmetric to Row 8.\n    *   Row 19 is symmetric to Row 0.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n</CANDIDATE 12>\n</INPUT_DATA>\n\n<AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\nExecute this pipeline sequentially for every Candidate.

Else, preserve color.\"\n- *Constraint:* If the reasoning is incoherent or vague, mark the Candidate as \"INVALID - VAGUE\".\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT (CRITICAL)\n- You must \"Back-Test\" the Crystallized Rule against the {{SOLVED_EXAMPLES}}.\n- For **EACH** Solved Example pair (Input -> Output), you must strictly perform this 3-step check:\n  1. **Hypothesis:** \"If I apply the Candidate's Rule to this Input, exactly what *should* happen?\"\n  2. **Observation:** \"Look at the actual Official Output. What *actually* happened?\"\n  3. **Verdict:** \"Do they match?\"\n- **Fatal Contradictions to Watch For:**\n  * **Scope Error:** Rule applies to specific colors (e.g., \"Blue\"), but the example changes \"Red\" pixels.\n  * **Geometry Error:** Rule says \"rotate 90,\" but example shows a flip.\n  * **Object Error:** Rule treats pixels individually, but example shows objects moving as blocks.\n- *Constraint:* Record exactly how many Solved Examples the candidate PASSED vs FAILED. **Do not stop at the first failure**; check all examples to determine the severity of the failure (e.g., \"Passed 2/3 Examples\").\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n- For Candidates that survived Phase 2 (or passed at least one example):\n- Look at the {{TEST_INPUT}} and the Candidate's <PROPOSED_SOLUTION> grid.\n- Does the proposed output actually follow the Crystallized Rule?\n- *Common Hallucination:* The text says \"Move Blue,\" but the grid shows Blue staying still.

examples we can infer two consistent facts:\n\n1) **The output size is always 20\u00d720.**  \n2) **The given input appears unchanged as a sub-rectangle of the output**, and the rest of the output is filled by extending the same pattern outward in a deterministic way.\n\nThe extension used is **mirror (reflection) padding**:\n\n- To extend in a direction beyond the known rectangle, we \u201cbounce\u201d back into the known rows/columns by reflection (like reflecting at the border).\n- Concretely, if the input has height \\(h\\) and width \\(w\\), then:\n  - Vertical reflected index sequence is:  \n    \\(0,1,2,\\dots,h-1,h-2,\\dots,1\\) (and repeats as needed)\n  - Horizontal reflected index sequence is:  \n    \\(0,1,2,\\dots,w-1,w-2,\\dots,1\\) (and repeats as needed)\n\nFor the **test input** (\\(h=11\\), \\(w=10\\)) this gives:\n\n- Output row indices (length 20):  \n  \\([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]\\)\n- Output column indices (length 20):  \n  \\([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,1]\\)\n\nSo each output cell \\((R,C)\\) is:\n\\[\n\\text{out}[R,C] = \\text{in}[\\text{rowIndex}[R],\\ \\text{colIndex}[C]]\n\\]\n\nApplying that to the test grid yields the following 20\u00d720 output.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid (20\u00d720)\n\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5

same 2\u2011color \u201cwallpaper\u201d pattern* that the input was cut from. The most consistent way to make every input a valid contiguous crop of a 20\u00d720, while using only the same two colors and without rotating/flipping the crop itself, is:\n\n1. **Treat the input as a sample of an infinite pattern formed by mirror-reflecting (bouncing) the input in both directions.**\n2. **Build the 20\u00d720 output by \u201creflect-indexing\u201d into the input**:\n   - For each output row index `r`, map it to an input row index using reflection (so after reaching the last input row, indices go back upward).\n   - For each output column index `c`, map it to an input column index similarly.\n3. The output cell `(r,c)` copies the input cell at the reflected indices.\n\nReflection indexing for length `n` uses period `P = 2*(n-1)`:\n- Let `m = k mod P`\n- If `m < n`, use index `m`; else use index `P - m`.\n\nFor the test input:\n- Height `n=11` \u21d2 `P=20` (fits exactly into 20 rows as a down-then-up bounce)\n- Width `n=10` \u21d2 `P=18` (bounce continues to reach 20 columns)\n\nApplying this produces the completed 20\u00d720.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid (20\u00d720)\n\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,5\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,5\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n      5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5\n      6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,5\n      5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,6\n      5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6\n      5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6\n      5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n      5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6\n      5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6\n      5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,5\n      5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5\n      5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n      6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"3\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the examples)\n\nAcross the solved examples, the output is always a **20\u00d720** grid, while the input is smaller.

My immediate thought is to dissect these examples and identify the underlying rules. It's clear that the output is always a 20x20 grid, but the inputs vary in size, which suggests some kind of tiling or resizing operation.\n\nMy initial analysis involves breaking down the structure of each example.  I'm looking for relationships between input size and output size, the colors used, and any discernible patterns in how the input data is mapped to the output. Example 1 has me thinking about a basic pasting of the input in the top left corner. However, this is quickly disrupted as Example 4 shows a displacement.\n\nA crucial observation emerges: the *location* of the input within the output is not fixed. Sometimes it's in the top-left, sometimes not. This hints at a more dynamic transformation, possibly related to some periodic or repeating structure. I start to entertain the possibility of an infinite grid or a torus where the input is merely a window.\n\nThe \"Examples\" are leading me down a rabbit hole.  I now have the task of deriving how the input pattern relates to the output pattern. I need to extrapolate. The Test Input is 11x10. I hypothesize that this Test Input fits in the center.\n\nBased on an observation from example 4, I assume the \"test input\" window fits at the center. I hypothesize this \"Test Input\" window is a crop or section of a grid, then tile it.\n\nSo I am now testing this hypothesis, and based on the nature of the test input. I now tile the input with a 2x2.\n\nThis should generate the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a test input grid into an output grid based on five solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Output Size:** In all five examples, the output grid size is consistently **20x20**, regardless of the input size (which varies: 8x10, 16x8, 10x10, 13x12, 8x10).\n2.  **Pattern Relationship:** The input grid acts as a \"seed\" or a \"window\" into a larger repeating pattern that fills the 20x20 output grid.\n    *   In **Example 1** (Input 8x10), the input matches the top-left corner of the output.\n    *   In **Example 3** (Input 10x10), the input matches the top-left corner.\n    *   In **Example 4** (Input 13x12), the input is found starting at row 2, column 0 of the output.\n    *   In **Example 5** (Input 8x10), the input is found at the bottom-right of the output (starting at row 12, column 10).\n3.  **Tiling Logic:** The most consistent transformation that explains the generation of the full 20x20 grid from a smaller rectangular input is **periodic tiling** (repeating the input grid).\n    *   Mathematically, this corresponds to mapping the output pixel at coordinate $(r, c)$ to the input pixel at $(r \\pmod H, c \\pmod W)$, where $H$ and $W$ are the height and width of the input grid.\n    *   Checking **Example 5**: Input 8x10. The input is at the bottom right. The pattern wraps around. For instance, Output row 0 matches Input row 4 ($0 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$? No, $12 \\pmod 8 = 4$. If Input starts at 12, then $y_{out}=12 \\to y_{in}=0$. So $y_{in} = (y_{out} - 12) \\pmod 8$. If we assume the underlying pattern is aligned such that $(0,0)$ of the pattern is $(0,0)$ of the input, then $O[r,c] = I[r \\pmod 8, c \\pmod{10}]$. Let's check Ex 5 Output(0,0). $I[0,0] = 8$. Output(0,0) is 8. Matches. This simple tiling works for Ex 5.\n    *   Checking **Example 1**: Input 8x10. $O[0,10]$ should be $I[0,0]=7$. Actual is 8. While there are some discrepancies/variations in Example 1, the other examples (especially 4 and 5) strongly suggest a tiling or sliding window mechanism. Given the Test Input has a strong diagonal texture (stripes of 5s and 6s), preserving this texture via tiling is the most logical deduction.\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\nThe output is a 20x20 grid generated by tiling the input grid.\n$Output[r, c] = Input[r \\pmod {Height}, c \\pmod {Width}]$\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   Input Size: 11 rows, 10 columns.\n*   Output Size: 20 rows, 20 columns.\n*   We will fill the output grid by copying the input grid.\n    *   Rows 0-10: Copy Input Rows 0-10.\n    *   Rows 11-19: Copy Input Rows 0-8 ($r \\pmod{11}$).\n    *   Cols 0-9: Copy Input Cols 0-9.\n    *   Cols 10-19: Copy Input Cols 0-9 ($c \\pmod{10}$).\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\nThe Input is:\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6\n```\n\nWe extend this to 20x20.\nRows 0-10, Cols 0-9: Identical to Input.\nRows 0-10, Cols 10-19: Identical to Input (since width is 10, col 10 maps to col 0).\nRows 11-19: Repeat rows starting from 0.\nRow 11 = Input Row 0\nRow 12 = Input Row 1\n...\nRow 19 = Input Row 8\n\nOutput Grid:\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n      5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n      5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6\n      5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n      5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_4_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nI inferred that the output is produced by **periodically tiling** the given input pattern to fill a fixed **20\u00d720** canvas:\n\n1.

Here's how my brain is working it through, step-by-step:\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the examples provided in the problem. I'm focusing on the input-output pairs and trying to see what kind of transformation is happening. The goal is to come up with a rule to transform the test input into the desired output.\n\nI start by looking at the dimensions of the input and output grids.  My initial thought is that it's a simple scaling, like doubling the size or something.  But, I quickly realize the scaling factor isn't a simple integer. I also noticed the number of colors in the grid is important. I read and re-read the hints provided very carefully. It helps but it also sometimes confuses me, as they have many hints.\n\nI'm trying to figure out if the input is simply a portion of a larger, pre-defined image. I'm looking for patterns, like repetition or rotation, between the input and output. The hint \"Large input 'wall' structures stay in place\" is key here. It suggests that certain parts of the input are preserved in the output, but in a modified form. This is the central clue.\n\nI'm trying to figure out if the output is just the input with some extra details added.  Maybe the extra details are generated by some rule? Maybe it's a fractal, a texture, a tiling pattern, something to fill the \"empty space\" within the output grid? I think that this seems plausible for the example, as the output seems to be more than a zoom or resize of the input.\n\nI get to a point where I think that the output is constructed by repeating the input (tiling), but this is not always true, as it does not work for all the examples. I now know that there is something more complex to the transformation. I realize that the examples have a relationship I need to find. \n\nI'm now thinking about how the provided input relates to what gets output. Is the input defining the entire grid, or is it a small part, and the task is to *complete* the output grid? This \"Input defines the logic\" theory is key.\n\nThen, there's the concept of \"Enclosed holes\" which are mentioned in the hints. This makes me suspect the solution involves identifying and treating these \"holes\" or enclosed regions specially. Maybe I should think about flood fills, where regions get filled with the same color, this is very important.\n\nI check different \"Wall Structures\" as mentioned in the hint. Then the Manhattan rule for generation which might create a tiling.\n\nThen I get to the key concept that the task is to replicate the structure, where the input is a texture (bricks, and lines, and colors) and I must generate the same structure, by repeating.\n\nThis leads me to think about the Test Input, which is now a pattern, and how to repeat the pattern. I try to apply this strategy to other examples to see if I am making progress.\nThen I conclude the following: for the given problem:\n1. Copy the Input into the Output\n2. Repeat horizontally, the Input values.\n3. Repeat the rows of the input in the vertical direction.\n\nI then check with this set of assumptions to see if this is consistent with the ARC logic and other examples. I convince myself the Tile operation is the correct logic. I then write my final response.\n\n\nTo solve the ARC task, I analyzed the provided examples and the test input.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Transformation Rule:** The task involves transforming a smaller input grid into a fixed-size 20x20 output grid.\n    *   **Scale/Position:** In Examples 1 and 3, the input grid is copied exactly into the top-left corner of the output grid.\n    *   **Content Extension:** The remaining area of the 20x20 grid (to the right and below the input) is filled with a pattern that extends the logic of the input.\n    *   **Example 1 vs Test Input:** Example 1 has an input with an \"Object\" (orange shape on azure background). The extension logic appears to generate a background with specific striped structures. The Test Input, however, resembles a \"Texture\" or \"Pattern\" (alternating bands/blocks of gray and magenta, like a brick wall).\n    *   **Texture Logic:** For inputs that are textured/periodic (like the Test Input), the most logical \"Manhattan/rectilinear\" extension is to **tile** or **repeat** the pattern to fill the larger grid. This preserves the \"dense rectilinear substructure\" and the \"wall structures\".\n\n2.  **Test Input Structure:**\n    *   Dimensions: 11x10.\n    *   Colors: 5 (Gray), 6 (Magenta).\n    *   Pattern: The rows show an alternating pattern of blocks (approx width 5).\n        *   Row 0: `6,6,6,6,6, 5,5,5,5,5` (Type A)\n        *   Row 1: `5,5,5,5,5, 5,6,6,6,6` (Type B - shifted)\n        *   Row 2: `6,6,6,5,6...` (Type A-ish)\n        *   The rows alternate roughly as A, B, A, B...\n    *   Target Output: 20x20.\n\n3.  **Construction of Output:**\n    *   **Top-Left Region (0-10, 0-9):** Copy the 11x10 Input exactly.\n    *   **Right Extension (0-10, 10-19):** To maintain the horizontal periodicity (5 blocks of 6, 5 blocks of 5, etc.), we repeat the input columns. Since the input width is 10 and the period seems to be 10 (or compatible with 10), copying Cols 0-9 to Cols 10-19 preserves the texture.\n    *   **Bottom Extension (11-19, 0-19):** To maintain the vertical alternation (A, B, A, B...), we need to append rows that follow the sequence. The input ends at Row 10 (Type B). The next row (11) should be Type A. Row 0 is Type A. Thus, we can fill Rows 11-19 by repeating the sequence starting from Row 0. We need 9 rows (11 to 19), so we copy Input Rows 0 to 8.\n\n**Conclusion:** The output is generated by tiling the input pattern. The 11x10 input is placed at (0,0). The right side (cols 10-19) is a horizontal repeat of the input. The bottom side (rows 11-19) is a vertical repeat of the input (using the first 9 rows to continue the alternating pattern).\n\n**Output Generation:**\n*   Rows 0-10: `[Input Row] + [Input Row]`\n*   Rows 11-19: `[Input Row (r-11)] + [Input Row (r-11)]`\n\nTest Input:\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6\n\nOutput Grid (20x20):\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n      5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n      5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6\n      5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n      5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"10\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Analysis of ARC Task and Test Input**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I need to figure out a transformation from an input grid to an output grid, and I have five example pairs to learn from, plus a test input. My first thought is to dive into the examples and try to spot any patterns.\n\nI start by looking at the dimensions of the grids and quickly realize that the output grid is always 20x20, while the inputs vary in size. That's a clue! My initial instinct is that it's a scaling operation, but that doesn't quite fit the varying input sizes. I start looking for relationships between the input and output's contents, suspecting a tiling or a rotated/flipped element to form the 20x20 output.\n\nI examine the pixel values (colors) within the input and output grids, looking for direct copies, rotations, or reflections. I try to match individual input rows/columns to the output, but it doesn't seem to be a straightforward one-to-one mapping. This makes me suspect the process isn't a simple pixelwise transformation but something more complex. I explore the idea of rotation, but the input and output sizes don't match, and the rotations don't align perfectly. I think about combinations, like tiling the input and then cropping the output but realize that also wouldn't explain the dimensions.\n\nI'm starting to think the output could be constructed by stitching together rotated or reflected copies of the input, but the arrangement is tricky. I start to wonder if there's a mathematical transformation involved, possibly a projection or wrap-around of some kind. I begin experimenting with linear transformations (rotations and translations) but encounter issues with getting them to consistently explain all the examples. I even consider edge cases and seamless tiling, and that doesn't work either.\n\nI shift my attention to the 'Test Input' with its diagonal element pattern, hoping it can guide me. Since the Output is 20x20, I assume that I'm supposed to find a 20x20 arrangement. Looking at Example 3, I am sure the \"repetition\" is important. I think about pattern completion or extension.  I recognize a potential mirror logic or tiling of the Test Input. This, combined with what I learned from Ex 1 with shifted tiles and horizontal reversal.\n\nSo, I decide to create the 20x20 from mirror operations. I build the output in blocks: TL is the input; TR is the horizontal reverse of the input; BL = Vertical mirror; BR = BL horizontally flipped. I can make it look seamless and preserve the textures. It's a nice pattern completion operation.\n\nAfter trying to map each pixel precisely, I accept the symmetry-based construction based on tiling and mirroring to be most robust. I apply these rules in the detailed plan, and create the final 20x20 output.\n\n\nThe transformation rule inferred from the examples, particularly taking into account the dimensions and the preservation of pattern continuity, is to expand the input grid into a 20x20 output grid using symmetry.\n\nThe specific logic for the Test Input (11x10) is:\n1.  **Horizontal Expansion**: The 10-column input is mirrored horizontally to create 20 columns. The left half (columns 0-9) is the original input. The right half (columns 10-19) is the horizontal reflection (reverse) of the input. This creates a seamless \"book-match\" symmetry across the vertical center line.\n2.  **Vertical Expansion**: The 11-row input serves as the top portion of the grid. To fill the remaining 9 rows (to reach height 20), the grid reflects vertically around the bottom row (Row 10). Row 11 is a copy of Row 9, Row 12 is a copy of Row 8, and so on, down to Row 19 which is a copy of Row 1. This creates a symmetry where the \"fold\" is at Row 10.\n\nThis transformation preserves the diagonal structures and the block patterns found in the input, creating a coherent 20x20 pattern.\n\n**Output Grid Calculation:**\n\n*   **Row 0:** Original `6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5` + Reverse `5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6`\n*   **Row 1:** Original `5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5`\n*   **Row 2:** Original `6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6`\n*   **Row 3:** Original `5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5`\n*   **Row 4:** Original `5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5`\n*   **Row 5:** Original `6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6`\n*   **Row 6:** Original `5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5`\n*   **Row 7:** Original `5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5`\n*   **Row 8:** Original `5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5`\n*   **Row 9:** Original `5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6` + Reverse `6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5`\n*   **Row 10:** Original `5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6` + Reverse `6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5`\n*   **Row 11:** Copy of Row 9\n*   **Row 12:** Copy of Row 8\n*   **Row 13:** Copy of Row 7\n*   **Row 14:** Copy of Row 6\n*   **Row 15:** Copy of Row 5\n*   **Row 16:** Copy of Row 4\n*   **Row 17:** Copy of Row 3\n*   **Row 18:** Copy of Row 2\n*   **Row 19:** Copy of Row 1\n\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n      5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n      6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n      5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n      5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n      6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n      5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n      5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n      6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1.

The transformation extends these boundary lines beyond the original input dimensions\n4. When lines reach edges, they reflect/wrap, creating interference patterns\n5. The original input appears embedded within the output, with the pattern extending in all directions\n\nFor the test input (11\u00d710 with colors 5 and 6):\n- There's a diagonal wave of 5s going from top-right (row 0, cols 5-9) down-left to around (row 6, col 0-4)\n- A second diagonal wave continues from row 6 going down-right toward (row 10, cols 6-8)\n- Column 0 has a vertical pattern of

creates the dense rectilinear repetition seen in the solved examples.\n\nApplying that to the test input yields the following 20\u00d720 output grid:\n\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6

solved examples to understand the transformation rules, specifically regarding the placement of the input and the pattern completion method.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Grid Size:** The output is always 20x20.\n2.  **Input Placement:** The input grid is copied exactly into the output grid. The position varies:\n    *   Example 1 (8x10 input): Placed at (0,0).\n    *   Example 2 (16x8 input): Placed at (0,6).\n    *   Example 4 (13x12 input): Placed at (2,0).\n    *   Example 5 (8x10 input): Placed at (12,10).\n    The placement seems to maximize the symmetry of the resulting grid, often aligning corners or centers. For the test input (11x10), the corner colors (6, 5, 5, 6) suggest a point-symmetric arrangement rooted at the corners. This implies the input should be placed at **(0,0)**.\n3.  **Pattern Completion:**\n    *   In Examples 2 and 4, the output grid exhibits **Point Symmetry** (180-degree rotation symmetry) around the center of the 20x20 grid (coordinate 9.5, 9.5).\n    *   This means `Output[r, c] == Output[19-r, 19-c]`.\n    *   The missing regions are filled to maintain this symmetry and local continuity (reflection/mirroring).\n    *   Specifically, for inputs placed at the Top-Left, the Top-Right quadrant is often a Horizontal Reflection of the Top-Left, and the Bottom-Left is a Vertical Reflection, creating a cohesive pattern.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Placement:** Place the 11x10 Test Input at the top-left corner `(0,0)` of the 20x20 output grid.\n    *   `Output[0..10][0..9]` is filled with the Input.\n2.  **Symmetry (Bottom-Right):** Apply Point Symmetry to fill the Bottom-Right region.\n    *   `Output[19-r][19-c] = Output[r][c]`.\n    *   This fills rows 9-19, columns 10-19.\n3.  **Completion (Top-Right):** Fill the Top-Right quadrant `(0..9, 10..19)` by mirroring the Top-Left horizontally.\n    *   `Output[r][c] = Output[r][19-c]`.\n    *   Input column 9 (`5,6...`) is adjacent to column 10. Mirroring creates a smooth transition if the edge is a symmetry axis or repeats. Given the blocky nature of 5s and 6s, mirroring is the standard completion here.\n4.  **Completion (Bottom-Left):** Fill the Bottom-Left quadrant `(11..19, 0..9)` by mirroring the Top-Left vertically.\n    *   `Output[r][c] = Output[19-r][c]`.\n    *   Or derived via Point Symmetry from the Top-Right.\n\n**Step-by-Step Construction:**\n*   **Rows 0-10, Cols 0-9:** Input data.\n*   **Rows 0-10, Cols 10-19:** Horizontal Mirror of Input (Col 0 maps to 19, Col 9 maps to 10).\n    *   Example: `Output[0][10] = Input[0][9]`.\n*   **Rows 11-19, Cols 0-19:** Vertical Mirror of the generated top half (Row 0 maps to 19, Row 8 maps to 11).\n    *   `Output[r][c] = Output[19-r][c]`.\n\n**Refinement on Rows 0-10 vs 0-8:**\nThe input has 11 rows. Mirroring vertically around the center (9.5) means `Row 19` mirrors `Row 0`, `Row 10` mirrors `Row 9`.\nSince `Row 10` is provided in the input, we must check if it matches the mirror of `Row 9`.\nInput R9: `5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6`. Mirror R9 (from Horizontal Mirror step): `6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5`.\nInput R10: `5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6`.\nThey are not identical, but the prompt says \"Input is copied exactly\". Thus, we keep Input R10 as is. For the remaining empty rows (11-19), we mirror the top rows (8 down to 0).\n\n**Final Algorithm:**\n1.  Copy Input to `(0,0)`.\n2.  Fill `Cols 10-19` for `Rows 0-10` by mirroring `Cols 0-9`.\n3.  Fill `Rows 11-19` by mirroring `Rows 8-0` (since Row 9 is the center-adjacent row, Row 10 is the \"extra\" past center, so Row 11 mirrors Row 8).\n\nOutput Grid:\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n      5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n      6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n      5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n      5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n      6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n      5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n      5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n      6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Analyzing and Constructing a Solution for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I need to solve a grid-based problem using given examples. The core seems to involve generating a larger 20x20 output grid from a smaller input grid, with specific constraints.\n\nFirst, I looked at the examples: I examined the dimensions, colors, and spatial arrangements of the inputs and outputs. Immediately I saw the constant 20x20 output size, regardless of input dimensions. I tried to identify a direct scaling or tiling operation, but it didn't seem that straightforward.\n\nI noticed in example 1, the top-left corner of the output matches the input. Then, I dug into this, looking at how the input grid is arranged within the output grid. The outputs have repeating elements from inputs, but it is not a direct copy, as in Example 2. The input could have been rotated, or partially mirrored. So I tried to understand the hint \"Large input 'wall' structures stay in place\". This prompted me to re-examine the outputs, looking for structures that extend from the given input.\n\nI then started forming a new hypothesis: that the input grid is a window or portion of a larger pattern or texture, and my task is to complete the 20x20 grid by extending that pattern. The hint \"Manhattan/parity/layer-based logic\" reinforced this idea. This would involve recognizing patterns that exist and that the output is not just a direct replication. I started examining if the output is generated by a specific rule.\n\nAt this point, I needed to figure out how the input fits into the output. What's the relation? Should it go in the corner? Or in the middle? I found that by placing the input at different offset points in the 20x20 grid, I got matching regions of the output. I also realized from that process, it did not follow a simple scaling. Also, the inputs seem to be positioned in the corner. If I place it differently, there are no matches, as in Example 5. It seemed the rule could be that all inputs have to be the top-left.\n\nI spent time analyzing if this pattern is based on symmetries by identifying if the grid can be divided into identical chunks. I tried to figure out a generative rule to build the output. I looked at specific examples. I had to focus on the structure of the pattern, it has something to do with the \"walls\", \"holes\" and symmetry. It has something to do with filling the grid with something. My goal became to find the pattern and extrapolate.\n\nAfter a lot of trial and error, a plan crystallized: Given a top-left input corner (or some specific position determined by the input itself), the pattern needs to be extended. I decided to mirror the inputs in a way that makes sense. The central rule is that there is an existing structure that needs to be preserved and completed, in that order, while maintaining symmetry, as well as preserving the two colors. The symmetry preserves the structure. I identified that \"holes\" are filled with a specific texture, but that the structure is the most important part of the solution.\n\nThe key insight was to view the input as a \"patch\" that's used to define the 20x20 grid by some process, instead of direct tiling. Given all of the example, the \"most-likely\" placement of the input grid is at top-left. So, I will proceed with reflecting the input horizontally, and vertically, to complete the 20x20, using the mirror points to construct the correct output.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a smaller input grid into a fixed-size $20 \\times 20$ output grid. Based on the solved examples, we can observe the following patterns:\n\n1.  **Output Dimensions:** All example outputs are $20 \\times 20$, regardless of the input size (which varies, e.g., $8 \\times 10$, $16 \\times 8$, $10 \\times 10$).\n2.  **Input Retention:** The input grid appears to correspond to a specific region (crop) of the output grid. In Examples 1 and 3, the input is exactly the top-left corner of the output. In other examples, it corresponds to different alignments (e.g., matching solid borders).\n3.  **Pattern Extension & Symmetry:** The output grids exhibit symmetries. For instance, Example 3 (0s and 3s) shows a room-like structure where the walls and patterns seem to mirror or repeat. The hints suggest \"Manhattan/parity/layer-based logic\" and that \"Large input 'wall' structures stay in place\". This implies the input defines the \"seed\" or the \"walls\" of a larger structure.\n\nGiven the Test Input is $11 \\times 10$ and has a solid-looking right edge (Column 9 is almost entirely `6`s except the top corner), and the task is to generate a $20 \\times 20$ grid, the most robust reconstruction\u2014consistent with the \"rectilinear substructure\" and symmetry seen in examples\u2014is to treat the input as the **top-left quadrant** (or half) of a symmetric structure.\n\n**Construction Logic for the Test Input:**\n\n*   **Placement:** Place the $11 \\times 10$ input grid into the top-left corner of the $20 \\times 20$ output grid (Rows 0-10, Cols 0-9).\n*   **Horizontal Symmetry:** The right half of the output (Cols 10-19) is generated by mirroring the left half horizontally. Specifically, Col 10 is a copy of Col 9, Col 11 is Col 8, ..., Col 19 is Col 0. This creates a thick central wall from the solid column 9 of the input.\n*   **Vertical Symmetry:** The bottom half of the output (Rows 11-19) is generated by mirroring the top part. Since the input provides rows 0-10 (11 rows), and the output needs 20 rows, we treat the center as the \"seam\". A standard reflection for a 20-row grid would mirror 0-9 to 19-10. Here, we have row 10 provided. We will assume the structure mirrors around the provided center. A reflection of rows 0-8 filling rows 19-11 ensures the pattern continues smoothly, leaving rows 9 and 10 as the unique central band.\n    *   Row 11 becomes a copy of Row 8 (mirrored horizontally).\n    *   Row 12 becomes a copy of Row 7...\n    *   Row 19 becomes a copy of Row 0.\n\nThis approach preserves the input \"walls\" and generates the \"dense rectilinear substructure\" characteristic of the examples.\n\n**Test Input (11x10):**\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6\n```\n\n**Output Generation:**\n1.  **Top-Left (0-10, 0-9):** Copy Input.\n2.  **Top-Right (0-10, 10-19):** Mirror Input horizontally.\n    *   Row 0: `6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5` + `5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6`\n    *   ...\n3.  **Bottom (11-19, 0-19):** Mirror Top rows 0-8 vertically.\n    *   Row 11 is symmetric to Row 8.\n    *   Row 19 is symmetric to Row 0.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n      5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n      6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n      5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5\n      5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5\n      5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n      6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n      5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n      5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5\n      6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- SELECT THE BEST RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1. It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
