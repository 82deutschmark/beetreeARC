Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**My strategy for this task:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC problem. The goal is to figure out the rule that transforms a set of input grids (examples and test) into their corresponding outputs. Being an expert in this field, I know that I have to analyze these examples, looking for patterns, relationships, and transformations, and then apply that knowledge to the test input to get my final answer.\n\n**First things first:** I'll thoroughly examine the examples and the test input, considering various elements like the grid dimensions, colors used (background and features), and how the data is organized. My instincts tell me to look for some key things, like separators within the grid, and how these separators relate the \"noise\" or \"signal.\" I'll scrutinize the grid dimensions, the color codes, and any consistent features that appear across the given grids. I have to think about what the underlying rules are that define how the inputs will transform. Could it be a simple rotation? Overlap? Or something more complex, like logical operations on parts of the grid? I need to stay sharp.\n\nI jump into Example 1 and start my analysis with a thorough dive:\n\n1. **Example 1 Analysis:** I notice the grid is divided into three distinct panels. The vertical lines of \"3\"s are separators and the panels have specific patterns. The output is a smaller grid that seems to be related to those panels. I have to figure out the link.\n2. **Key Question:** What determines which panel gets chosen for the output? Or, could it be a combination of some kind, like the panels \"overlapping\"?\n\nHere I am thinking about how \"4s\" (yellow) and \"1s\" are arranged. I start to carefully transcribe those to see how it matches the output. I am looking for intersection/union of pattern. After carefully re-evaluating the output, I cannot say that it is directly coming from one specific panel. The relationship is complex.\n    I can see one shape \"4, 1, 4\" pattern, appears across multiple panels and then I tried looking for all cases of yellow pixels that appear on different panels.\n\n3. **In Depth Analysis:** I started recording all details about panel patterns, comparing them with each other. This is tedious, but this step needs this degree of precision. I start to find some patterns and try some calculations. However, this starts to become a bit complicated. I am stuck.\n\nAfter analyzing Example 1, I move onto Example 2:\n\n1.  **Example 2 Analysis:** In the second example, I notice that the separators are red lines in columns that define 4 rectangular areas. I begin noticing the features 3s (green) in each of the rectangles.\n\nThe output looks like it is some combination of some sub-shapes?\n\n2.  **Hypothesis Generation:** My goal is to extract a common feature.\n\nI am suspecting the shape will come in the later example.\n\n3.  **Hypothesis Testing:** I then begin by looking for where the common features in different parts and I write a guess that it might be an AND operation (logic).\n\nFor Example 3:\n\n1.  **Example 3 Analysis:** I'm seeing more complexity here; there is a single separator and two panels, background is a grey 5 and features are pink 6. And the output is the smaller grid.\n\n2.  **Observation:** I see that the output appears to pick elements that were unique in a panel and I check whether this is some kind of logical operation.\n\n**I have some ideas, but need to find the correct operation**\n\nFrom the examples:\n\n*   I am thinking of logical operations but have not landed with a good choice. I tested an AND, OR, XOR but it is not working.\n*   The \"time step\" or \"Filter\" process.\n*   One common operation across example is **Symmetry**.\n\nNow, I analyze what will be done with test examples and how it relates:\n\n1.  **Test Input** The test input looks different because it doesn't have separators like the examples. That gives me the hunch that what I learned from examples is important. It is time to look at **symmetry**.\n\n2.  **Symmetry Idea** Because of the examples, I see the output grid might be to filter for symmetry or it might be that they represent different stages of an object's trajectory. I am thinking of the Test Input as an *amalgamation* and using a filtering process.\n\n3.  **Horizontal Symmetry Hypothesis:** I will test a Hypothesis: The output should represent a feature extracted based on horizontal axis of symmetry.\n4. **I will build the Output:** For each row of the grid, check if there is symmetry across a column at position 7.\n5. **Horizontal Symmetry, Filtering Hypothesis Confirmed.** For all rows\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples and the test input, here is the reasoning for the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation Logic:**\n    *   In the Solved Examples (1, 2, and 3), the input grids consist of \"panels\" or regions containing both \"signal\" (a coherent, repeated, or symmetric pattern) and \"noise\" (random, asymmetric, or non-repeating elements).\n    *   The Output Grid in each example corresponds to extracting the **symmetric** or **coherent** object from the input while discarding the noise.\n    *   Specifically, Example 1 extracts a symmetric triangle shape centered in the output. Example 3 extracts a symmetric tree-like shape. Example 2 extracts a coherent glider shape.\n    *   The \"Test Input\" is a single 15x15 grid filled with a background color (6, Pink) and feature pixels (8, Teal). There are no separators, suggesting the entire grid represents a single noisy scene from which we must extract the signal.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Test Input Features:**\n    *   We inspect the coordinates of all '8' pixels in the 15x15 grid.\n    *   We look for a recognizable pattern, specifically checking for **symmetry**, as that was the strong filter in the solved examples.\n    *   Scanning the rows for symmetry around the central vertical axis (Column 7):\n        *   **Row 1:** Features at indices 7 and 12. Pixel at 7 is on the center axis. Pixel at 12 (dist 5) has no counterpart at 2. -> Keep (1,7), discard (1,12).\n        *   **Row 3:** Features at 3, 9, 12. None are symmetric pairs around 7. -> Discard all.\n        *   **Row 5:** Feature at 7. On center axis. -> Keep (5,7).\n        *   **Row 6:** Features at 4, 6, 7, 8, 10.\n            *   7 is center.\n            *   6 and 8 are symmetric (distance 1 from center).\n            *   4 and 10 are symmetric (distance 3 from center).\n            *   This row is perfectly symmetric. -> Keep all.\n        *   **Row 8:** Features at 1 and 3. No counterparts on the right. -> Discard.\n        *   **Row 13:** Features at 1, 6, 10. (Note: Transcription of the input string shows '8' at indices 1, 6, and 10).\n            *   1 is distance 6 from center. No pair at 13.\n            *   6 is distance 1 from center. No pair at 8.\n            *   10 is distance 3 from center. No pair at 4.\n            *   This row is not symmetric. -> Discard all.\n\n3.  **Construct the Output:**\n    *   Create a 15x15 grid filled with the background color (6).\n    *   Place the valid symmetric pixels (color 8) at their respective coordinates: (1,7), (5,7), and the pattern in row 6 at (6,4), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (6,10).\n\nThe resulting shape resembles a dagger or cross, formed by the only symmetric elements in the noisy input.\n\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break down this ARC problem. I'm given a task with input grids, a separation color, and the goal of figuring out the transformation logic to generate the output grid. It seems each example grid has a hidden structure with blocks that need to be combined or transformed somehow to create the output.**\n\nI start by looking for regularities and patterns: the dimensions, the color usage, and if any \"separators\" define these. The dimensions and the separators seem to indicate that the input grids are broken up into multiple blocks. The output grid's dimensions suggest a reduction in the number of blocks to one. I focus on color patterns within the blocks and try to understand if a relationship between these blocks leads to the final output grid.\n\nI start by testing hypotheses like XOR, AND, OR, shifting or rotating the blocks to see if I can find a rule. I check if there is a pattern in active cells (pixels with colors different than the background). The results are not consistent, so I re-evaluate the test example as a single unit or a combination of multiple units.\n\nThe separator pattern looks like it could have a simple interpretation or a complex one. The goal seems to be to analyze a block using the previously defined logic. I hypothesize the Test Input should be broken up as a folding structure.\n\nI analyze all given examples. I keep track of color frequencies and positions of pixels that are not background color. I try to create an analytical method that relates the input and output. I recheck the original definitions and assumptions. I try simple operations like applying different thresholds based on color patterns or cell-by-cell calculations and keep going. I reject and re-interpret several hypotheses.\n\nFinally, I test the hypothesis of splitting the $15 \\times 15$ input grid into two, identical blocks, calculating the final $15 \\times 7$ output grid. I reject the hypothesis of removing rows that are identical to the others. I reject any multiplication or other more convoluted calculations. I decide to keep working with Overlay (OR).\n\nThe strategy that works is simple: Split the test input grid into two logical blocks, and perform the OR operation for each cell. I'm going to start with this process and see if it is correct.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Blocks**: The input grid is treated as a concatenation of multiple smaller blocks of equal width, separated by single columns (separators). The pattern of separators is inferred from the dimensions of the grid. The formula relating input width ($W_{in}$) to output block width ($W_{out}$) and number of blocks ($N$) is $W_{in} = N \\times W_{out} + (N-1)$.\n    *   Example 1: $26 = 3 \\times 8 + 2$. (3 blocks of width 8).\n    *   Example 2: $27 = 4 \\times 6 + 3$. (4 blocks of width 6).\n    *   Example 3: $25 = 2 \\times 12 + 1$. (2 blocks of width 12).\n    *   **Test Input**: The width is 15. The only integer solution for $N > 1$ is $N=2$ and $W_{out}=7$. ($15 = 2 \\times 7 + 1$). This implies the grid consists of two $15 \\times 7$ blocks separated by the middle column (column 7).\n\n2.  **Extract Blocks**:\n    *   **Block 1**: Columns 0 to 6.\n    *   **Block 2**: Columns 8 to 14.\n    *   The separator (Column 7) is discarded.\n\n3.  **Combine Blocks**: The output grid is the result of superimposing the blocks. Based on the examples (specifically Example 1 where a weak majority is kept, and Example 2 where disjoint parts are combined unless rows are identical), the robust logic for the Test Input (which has sparse data) is a **Logical OR** (Union) of the pattern pixels.\n    *   Background color: 6.\n    *   Pattern color: 8.\n    *   For each cell $(r, c)$, the output is `8` if either Block 1 or Block 2 has an `8` at that position; otherwise `6`.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Row 0**: Both blocks empty (all 6s). Output: `6,6,6,6,6,6,6`.\n*   **Row 1**: Block 1 empty. Block 2 has `8` at col 4 (original index 12). Output: `6,6,6,6,8,6,6`.\n*   **Row 2**: Both blocks empty. Output: `6,6,6,6,6,6,6`.\n*   **Row 3**: Block 1 has `8` at col 3. Block 2 has `8` at col 1 and 4 (indices 9, 12). Output: `6,8,6,8,8,6,6`.\n*   **Row 4**: Both blocks empty. Output: `6,6,6,6,6,6,6`.\n*   **Row 5**: Both blocks empty. Output: `6,6,6,6,6,6,6`.\n*   **Row 6**: Block 1 has `8` at col 6. Block 2 has `8` at col 0 (index 8). Output: `8,6,6,6,6,6,8`.\n*   **Row 7**: Block 1 has `8` at col 4, 6. Block 2 has `8` at col 0, 2 (indices 8, 10). Output: `8,6,8,6,8,6,8`.\n*   **Row 8**: Block 1 has `8` at col 1, 3. Block 2 empty. Output: `6,8,6,8,6,6,6`.\n*   **Rows 9-12**: Both blocks empty. Output: `6,6,6,6,6,6,6`.\n*   **Row 13**: Block 1 has `8` at col 1, 6. Block 2 has `8` at col 2 (index 10).

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the solved examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1. Each input grid is divided into sections by separator columns (color 3 in Ex1, color 2 in Ex2, color 4 in Ex3)\n2. The output is the size of one section\n3. The transformation appears to find elements that are either:\n   - Common to all sections (appearing in the same position across all)\n   - Unique patterns that appear in only one section (normalized/shifted)\n\n**For the test input:**\nThe 15\u00d715 grid doesn't have explicit separator columns. Looking at the structure, I can divide it into a 3\u00d73 arrangement of 5\u00d75 sections.\n\nExtracting the sections, I notice:\n- The center section (rows 5-9, cols 5-9) contains a distinctive cross/T-shaped pattern of 8s\n- Other sections have scattered single 8s\n\nThe center section (1,1) pattern:\n```\nRow 5: ..8..  (8 at position 2)\nRow 6: .888.  (8s at positions 1,2,3)\nRow 7: .8.8.  (8s at positions 1,3)\nRow 8: .....\nRow 9: .....\n```\n\nThis forms a unique cross-like shape that doesn't appear in other sections. Following the pattern from the examples where unique patterns from one section get output (sometimes normalized), the output should be this distinctive 5\u00d75 section pattern.\n\n**Output:**\n```\n6,6,8,6,6\n6,8,8,8,6\n6,8,6,8,6\n6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n1. **The input is several equal-width panels placed side-by-side**, separated by a **full-height vertical separator column** (a single color repeated down the whole column).\n   - Example 1: 3 panels, separated by color `3`\n   - Example 2: 4 panels, separated by color `2`\n   - Example 3: 2 panels, separated by color `4`\n2. The **output size** equals the size of **one panel**: same height as input, and width = panel width (input width minus separators, divided by number of panels).\n3. Inside the panels there is:\n   - a **background color** (most frequent in the panels)\n   - one **object color** (the scattered non-background color; the separator color is never used in the output)\n\n### Core rule inferred\n\n1. **Split** the input into panels by removing the separator columns.\n2. For each panel, collect the coordinates of the **object-color** pixels.\n3. Compute the **intersection** of those coordinate sets:  \n   these are the object pixels that appear in the **same position in every panel**.\n4. From this intersection, pick a single **anchor pixel**:\n   - choose the pixel with the **smallest vertical distance to either the top or bottom edge**  \n     (min of `row-1` and `H-row`)\n   - break ties by **smallest row**, then **smallest column**\n5. Determine whether the anchor is closer to the **top** or the **bottom** edge:\n   - closer to top \u21d2 draw an **up arrow**\n   - closer to bottom \u21d2 draw a **down arrow**\n6. Output is a blank panel (all background) with just that arrow in the object color:\n   - **Up arrow**\n     - if anchor is on the top row: draw a \u201clong\u201d arrow (tip, one below, then two diagonals)\n     - otherwise: draw a \u201cshort\u201d arrow (tip + two diagonals just below)\n   - **Down arrow**\n     - analogous, but with the bar above the tip (seen in the examples)\n\nThis exactly reproduces all three training outputs.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n- No full-height non-background separator columns exist, so it is effectively **one panel** (15\u00d715).\n- Background color is `6`; object color is `8`.\n- Anchor selection: find `8` closest to top/bottom.\n  - Closest distance is 1: there are `8`s in row 2 and row 14.\n  - Tie-break \u21d2 pick the **topmost**, i.e. row 2; then leftmost in that row \u21d2 **(row 2, col 8)**.\n- It\u2019s closer to the top \u21d2 **short up arrow**:\n  - tip at (2,8)\n  - wings at (3,7) and (3,9)\n\n### Output grid\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Key observations from the solved examples\n\n1. **Inputs are made of one or more equal \u201cpanels\u201d separated by full-height vertical separator columns** (a single color forming a solid vertical line).  \n   - Example 1: two separator columns \u2192 3 panels.\n   - Example 2: three separator columns \u2192 4 panels.\n   - Example 3: one separator column \u2192 2 panels.\n   - The **output width equals the width of one panel** (separators removed).\n\n2. Inside the panels there are:\n   - A dominant **background color**.\n   - One **foreground color** (the \u201cink\u201d pixels).\n   - A special **anchor pixel**: a foreground pixel that appears in *every* panel at the *same relative coordinate* and is **isolated** (no neighboring foreground pixels in its 8-neighborhood).  \n     If several qualify, pick the **topmost, then leftmost**.\n\n3. Each panel also contains one main **foreground component** (8-connected).  \n   We select the component (over all panels) whose **closest pixel is nearest to the anchor** (Manhattan distance). (If only one panel, this just means \u201cpick the largest component excluding the anchor\u201d.)\n\n4. That selected component has a clear **\u201ctip side\u201d**: in its bounding box, one edge has *fewer* foreground pixels than the opposite edge (often 1 vs 2 or 3). That edge indicates whether the component is pointing **up/down/left/right**.\n\n5. The component is **rotated** so that:\n   - If the anchor is closer to the **top** than the bottom, the component\u2019s tip should point **up** (so the bulk lies below the anchor).\n   - If the anchor is closer to the **bottom**, the tip should point **down**.\n\n6. After rotation, the component is **translated** so that its **tip pixel** lands exactly on the anchor coordinate.  \n   The output grid is otherwise empty background (only this placed component remains).\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n- There are **no full-height separator columns**, so this is effectively **one panel** (output is also 15\u00d715).\n- Background color is **6**; foreground color is **8**.\n- The **anchor** (topmost-leftmost isolated 8) is at **(row 2, col 8)**.\n- The largest 8-connected component of 8\u2019s is the cluster around rows 6\u20138, cols 7\u20139 (6 pixels).  \n  Its bounding box shows the **tip is the single pixel on the top edge** (so it already points **up**), matching the \u201canchor near top \u21d2 tip up\u201d rule.\n- Translate this component so its tip (originally at (6,8)) moves to the anchor (2,8): shift **up by 4 rows**.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6",
