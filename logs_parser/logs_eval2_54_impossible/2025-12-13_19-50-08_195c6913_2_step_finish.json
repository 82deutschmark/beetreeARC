model_id=\"gemini-3-high_1_step_1\">\n**Synthesis of ARC Task Strategy**\n\nAlright, the user's thrown me a curveball with this ARC task. They want me to decode a pattern-recognition puzzle based on a few examples, and I'm ready for the challenge. My initial instinct is to break down the task into smaller, more manageable parts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's in play. In this case, I'm working with a set of image grids. I have an input, and the goal is to predict the corresponding output. The inputs and outputs seem to have a fixed size, in this case, 20x20. I observe that the input grids are made up of regions with distinct background colors. These backgrounds define a 'TL region' and a 'BR region.'\n\n**Here's the approach I take, step by step:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Example:** I start by examining the provided examples, especially Example 1, to identify the main patterns and their relationships. I'm looking for clues about the underlying transformation the problem is imposing.\n2.  **Define the Structure:** It becomes clear that the image grids have distinct objects placed against a background. My goal is to extract those objects and understand how they interact.\n3.  **Pattern Decomposition:** I identify two key patterns: one in the top-left region and the other in the bottom-right region.\n4.  **Transformation Analysis:** I note that these regions have background colors and specific patterns. I suspect the output is a result of some pattern overlay process.\n5.  **Shifting Hypothesis:** In the analysis, I considered that the output could be created through a combination of the two patterns, where one might be moved (\"shifted\" or \"translated\") relative to the other.\n6.  **Deconstructing the Pattern:** I need to look for repeating units within the pattern, i.e., \"periodic structure.\" I need to find the \"period,\" the size of the unit that makes a repeated structure.\n7.  **Identify the Underlying Principle:** I need to build a logical rule that links an input to its output. It could involve shifting the pattern, combining the two, or some other transformation that applies consistently across examples.\n\n**In the Analysis:**\n\n*   I check for periodicity, e.g., if there are patterns.\n*   The \"diagonal\" pattern is interesting. I'll need to see if it's the boundary between two repeating patterns.\n*   I look at the background and try to infer the rules.\n*   I considered a lot of possibilities: rotation, scaling, shifting.\n*   Based on example, I decided that an overlap operation is likely. I'll need to figure out the overlap rule, so my analysis will include looking at where the inputs and outputs overlap.\n*   It looks like the key is how the patterns are laid out.\n*   So I need to encode the input structure.\n\nAfter much trial and error, I believe I can solve this. The steps are:\n\n1.  **Extract the pattern**: from each of the two regions.\n2.  **Apply translation**: The translation is the main parameter here. I assume it's like a sliding operation and the translation is some kind of a vector.\n3.  **Combine the two**: The key rule here is that the BR \"pattern\" overwrites the TL \"pattern\".\n\nThis approach will help me understand this problem and construct an efficient solution.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we analyze the transformation rules based on the provided examples, specifically identifying the two distinct patterns (Top-Left and Bottom-Right) and their propagation across the grid.\n\n**1. Analysis of Patterns and Backgrounds:**\n*   **Backgrounds:** The grid is divided into two regions by a diagonal boundary.\n    *   Top-Left (TL) Region: Background color 8 (Teal).\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR) Region: Background color 9 (Maroon).\n    *   The output preserves these background regions, except where patterns overlay them.\n*   **TL Pattern (from Input):**\n    *   Located in the TL region (rows 1 and 2).\n    *   Row sequence: `8 3 3 8 3 3 8 3 3 8 6 6` repeating.\n    *   Objects: Green (3) and Magenta (6). The Teal (8) is background/transparent.\n    *   Vertical Structure: The pattern appears on 2 consecutive rows, followed by 1 empty row (containing only background). This implies a vertical period of 3 rows.\n    *   Propagation Vector: Based on Example 1, the TL pattern shifts horizontally by 12 positions for every vertical period (3 rows).\n        *   Rows $1, 4, 7, 10, ...$ use the pattern shifted by $0, 12, 24, 6, ...$ respectively.\n        *   Rows $2, 5, 8, 11, ...$ use the pattern shifted by $0, 12, 24, 6, ...$ respectively.\n*   **BR Pattern (from Input):**\n    *   Located in the BR region (rows 25 and 26).\n    *   Objects: A 2x2 block of Orange (7) pixels.\n    *   Propagation Vector: Based on Example 1, the BR objects move with a vector of $(+4, +1)$ (4 rows down, 1 column right).\n    *   The BR pattern overwrites the TL pattern and backgrounds where they collide.\n\n**2. Construction of the Output Grid:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Initialize Background.**\n    Copy the input grid's background structure (the 8s and 9s).\n\n*   **Step 2: Apply TL Pattern.**\n    For rows $r$ where $r \\pmod 3 \\neq 0$ (i.e., rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8...):\n    *   Calculate the shift factor $k = \\lfloor r / 3 \\rfloor$.\n    *   Horizontal shift $s = (12 \\times k) \\pmod{30}$.\n    *   Construct the row pattern by repeating `8 3 3 8 3 3 8 3 3 8 6 6` to fill width 30.\n    *   Shift this pattern right by $s$.\n    *   Overlay the non-background pixels (3 and 6) onto the grid at row $r$.\n\n*   **Step 3: Apply BR Pattern.**\n    *   Identify the source block of 7s at $(25, 24)$. The block is $2 \\times 2$.\n    *   Propagate this block forward and backward using the vector $(4, 1)$.\n    *   Positions: $(r, c) = (25 + 4t, 24 + t)$ for integer $t$.\n    *   Wrap coordinates modulo 30 (for rows and columns).\n    *   Draw the $2 \\times 2$ block of 7s at these positions, overwriting existing pixels.\n\n**Refining the positions for 7s:**\n*   $t=0: (25, 24)$\n*   $t=1: (29, 25)$\n*   $t=2: (33, 26) \\to (3, 26)$\n*   $t=3: (7, 27)$\n*   $t=4: (11, 28)$\n*   $t=5: (15, 29)$\n*   $t=6: (19, 30) \\to (19, 0)$\n*   $t=7: (23, 1)$\n*   $t=-1: (21, 23)$\n*   $t=-2: (17, 22)$\n*   $t=-3: (13, 21)$\n*   $t=-4: (9, 20)$\n*   $t=-5: (5, 19)$\n*   $t=-6: (1, 18)$\n\n**Applying the transformation to the Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Backgrounds:** Preserved from input.\n2.  **TL Pattern Rows ($S = \\text{Shift}$):**\n    *   R1, R2: $S=0$. Pattern: `8 3 3 8 3 3 8 3 3 8 6 6 ...`\n    *   R4, R5: $S=12$.

I see a 30x30 grid with a diagonal split.  The colors are 8 (Azure) and 9 (Maroon), and it looks like it\u2019s divided into a region of 8s (Top-Left) and a region of 9s (Bottom-Right), but not perfectly diagonal.  There are these patterns of `3,3` (Green) and `6,6` (Magenta) in the 8 region and a sort of island of 8s in the 9 region with some `7,7` (Orange) inside.  My initial thought is that there are these two separate textures: the Azure texture, and the Maroon texture, defined over the whole grid.\n\nI see that the pattern in the Azure (8) part is `8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,8,8`.  And the 9 part (Maroon) has a smaller shape of 8 that overlaps it at the bottom. The core concept here seems to be about transferring the shape, as with the prior examples, the shapes of the two primary regions (8 and 9) change.\n\nIt feels like there's a geometric transformation and a texture swap going on. Basically: if a part of Region 8 \"goes into\" Region 9, the same shape in Region 9 needs to \"go into\" Region 8 in the output. And I'm starting to think the 8-region, which is the main part of the Top, and a bit of the bottom, gets transferred (flipped) into the 9-region. And `7,7` is a decoration, a small thing on the larger shape, so the decorations, in effect, are moved together with the shape.\n\nThe bottom (9s and the partial 8) gets flipped and now sits on the top, with pattern: `9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9`, and the decoration `7,7` is placed in this newly flipped area. The top (8s) is now mostly clean, with the decoration `7,7`, moved into its area. The goal of this task is to make this work, for any input with the given constraints and parameters, which should make the process much more scalable.\n\n\nThe solution involves identifying two regions in the grid (Background A and Background B), extracting the texture/pattern from the primary region, and applying a specific transformation that involves swapping textures and reflecting \"island\" features.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Regions:** The grid is divided into two regions by a diagonal boundary.\n    *   **Region A (Top-Left/Right):** Background color 8 (Azure). This region contains a repeating pattern of decorations: `3,3` (Green) and `6,6` (Magenta).\n    *   **Region B (Bottom-Left):** Background color 9 (Maroon). In the input, this region is mostly solid 9s, but contains an \"Island\" of 8s extending into it.\n\n2.  **Analyze Patterns:**\n    *   **Texture A ($P_F$):** Derived from Region A. It is a repeating row pattern on the background of 8: `8, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8...`.\n    *   **Island Decoration ($D_I$):** The input has a unique feature `7,7` (Orange) located in the bottom-right part of the grid (within the extension of region 8).\n\n3.  **Transformation Rules:**\n    *   **Background Fill:** The output preserves the background regions (Region A remains 8, Region B remains 9).\n    *   **Texture Swap:**\n        *   Region A (Background 8) is cleared of its original texture (becomes \"Clean 8\").\n        *   Region B (Background 9) is filled with Texture A. We map the pattern `3,3...6,6` onto the 9-background. The pattern row becomes `9, 3, 3, 9, 3, 3, 9, 3, 3, 9, 6, 6, 9, 9...`.\n    *   **Feature Reflection:**\n        *   The \"Island\" feature (an intrusion of one region into the other) is reflected vertically.\n        *   The decorations from the bottom part of the grid (`7,7`) are moved to the top part via vertical reflection ($row \\to 29 - row$).\n        *   Input `7,7` is at Rows 25-26. Output `7,7` moves to Rows 3-4.\n        *   The \"Hole\" logic: In the solved examples, an island of Color A inside Region B in the input becomes an island of Color B inside Region A in the output. Here, we create a block of 9s (with texture) inside Region A, corresponding to the reflected position of the 8-block from the input. However, given the complexity, the primary visible change is the movement of the unique decoration `7,7` and the filling of Region 9 with the pattern.\n\n4.  **Construction:**\n    *   Create a grid with the same background split as the input (8s and 9s).\n    *   **Region 8 (Top):** Clear all `3`s and `6`s. Place `7,7` at the reflected top position (Rows 3-4, Cols 24-25).\n    *   **Region 9 (Bottom):** Fill every row in this region with the pattern `9, 3, 3, 9, 3, 3, 9, 3, 3, 9, 6, 6, 9, 9...`.\n    *   **Island Swap:** Create a rectangular region of 9s in the top half (reflected from the bottom 8-block) and fill it with the pattern. The bottom 8-block is effectively replaced by the pattern fill of Region 9.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\nRow 0-12 (Region 8): Solid 8, except for the reflected `7,7` and the new island of 9s (patterned).\nRow 13-29 (Region 9 + 8): The area that was 9 is filled with the pattern.

model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the following transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Pattern Definition**: In the top-left area, there's a pattern made of 2x2 colored blocks (test: 3,3,3,6 from the blocks at rows 1-2)\n2. **Markers**: Single colored pixels indicating where horizontal lines start (test: 3 at (14,0) and (26,0))\n3. **Destination Block**: A 2x2 block of another color (test: 7,7 at rows 25-26, cols 24-25)\n4. **Secondary Region**: A different colored region (test: 9s) separating the pattern area from destination\n\nThe transformation:\n- Clears the pattern definition and destination blocks to background color\n- Draws horizontal lines from markers through the secondary region using the repeating pattern\n- Draws vertical/diagonal lines along the boundary between regions using the pattern\n- Places destination color (7) at intersection points and boundaries\n\nThe pattern 3,3,3,6 repeats with period 4, aligned by column position.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7\n3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,8\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

Read the colors of these blocks **left-to-right** to get a repeating sequence `P`.\n   - In the examples this produced sequences like `[2,2,8]`, `[4,1]`, `[2,2,3]`.\n\n2. **A separate 2\u00d72 solid-color block elsewhere** (not part of the key): its color is a special **marker color** `M`.  \n   - This block is **removed** in the output (repainted as surrounding background), but its color `M` is used as \u201cend caps\u201d on the drawn path.\n\n3. **One or more single cells on the left edge** having the first color of `P`: these are **start markers**.\n\n---\n\n### What the output does\n\n1. **Erase**:\n   - Replace every cell of the top-left key blocks with the surrounding background color.\n   - Replace every cell of the separate 2\u00d72 marker block with its surrounding background color.\n\n2. **For each left-edge start marker**:\n   - Let `F` be the color immediately to its right (this is the \u201cfill\u201d color the path travels through).\n   - Starting at the marker, draw a monotone \u201csnake\u201d path through cells of color `F` by repeating:\n     - go **as far right as possible** through `F`\n     - then go **as far up as possible** through `F`\n     - then right again, then up again, \u2026\n   - Paint every visited path cell with the repeating sequence `P`, advancing one step in `P` per move (the sequence **continues through turns**, it does not restart).\n   - Whenever a right/up run stops because the next cell is *not* `F` (and is inside the grid), paint that blocking cell with the marker color `M`.\n   - Stop if you hit the grid boundary in the movement direction, or if after turning you cannot move even one cell.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n- Top-left 2\u00d72 blocks give the pattern sequence: **`P = [3,3,3,6]`**.\n- The separate 2\u00d72 block is color **7**, so **`M = 7`** (and that original 7-block is erased).\n- The left-edge start markers are the **3** at row 15 col 1 and row 27 col 1.\n- The fill color to their right is **9**, so `F = 9`.\n\nFollowing the right/up snake rule from each start produces the output below.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,7,8,7,8,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,6,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n<REASONING_MODEL_C model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_4_step_3\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Identify the two main region colors**\n   -

instead its color is reused to mark exits/ends of the constructed line (at turns/endpoints where the line leaves the blob into the background).\n\nThe \u201cinstruction\u201d pixels (singletons) are not preserved as single pixels; they become the starting points of the drawn line.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Identify the roles of colors in the test input\n\n#### Main 2\u2011color scene\nAlmost everything is **8** and **9**.  \nThe top\u2011left palette cluster sits inside an **8** area, so:\n\n- **Background = 8**\n- **Blob to draw through = 9**\n\n#### Palette (line pattern) colors\nThe top\u2011left cluster (rows 2\u20133) contains four separate little blocks when read left\u2192right:\n- three blocks of **3**\n- one block of **6**\n\nSo the repeating line pattern is the cyclic sequence:\n\n**[3, 3, 3, 6]** repeated along the path.\n\n(That\u2019s why some examples have patterns like 2,2,8 repeating: the first color appears in multiple blocks.)\n\n#### Junction/endpoint marker color\nThe only other \u201cforeign\u201d color block is **7** (a 2\u00d72 in the lower\u2011right area).  \nThat block is removed, and **7** is used to mark the **first background cell right after a line segment leaves the 9\u2011blob**.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Find the start markers (instruction single pixels)\nThere are two isolated **3** pixels on the left edge:\n- (row 15, col 1)\n- (row 27, col 1)\n\nEach has a **9** immediately to the right, so each starts a line.\n\n---\n\n### 3) How the line is constructed (the \u201cstaircase\u201d rule)\n\nFor each start marker:\n\n1. **Go right** through consecutive **9** cells.\n   - Color the visited cells (including the start marker) with the repeating palette sequence **[3,3,3,6]**, continuing step-by-step.\n   - When the next cell is **8** (background), color that first **8** cell with **7**.\n2. From the last 9-cell you colored, **try to go up**:\n   - Only if the cell above is still **9**.\n   - Color upward through the 9s continuing the same cyclic palette sequence.\n   - When you exit into **8**, mark that exit cell with **7**.\n3. Alternate **right, up, right, up\u2026** until the next segment cannot start (above isn\u2019t 9) or you hit the grid border.\n\nAlso: the original palette blocks (3/6) and the original 7-block are reset back to background **8**.\n\nApplied here, this produces:\n- From row 15 col 1: right to col 7, up to row 7, right to col 24.\n- From row 27 col 1: right to col 11, up to row 19, right to col 27, up to row 8, right to the border.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,7,8,7,8,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,6,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_F>\n<REASONING_MODEL_G model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n### Inferred rule (from the solved examples)\n\nEach input contains (ignoring the tiny \u201cmarker\u201d colors) a **2\u2011color scene**:\n- **background** = the most common color\n- **largest blob** = the other main color (a single big connected region)\n\nThe extra colors are *not part of the final picture*; they are instructions for drawing thin orthogonal lines.\n\n#### 1) Read the \u201cpalette\u201d (repeating line colors)\nIn the **top-left** there is a small horizontal cluster of **2\u00d72 blocks** of non-scene colors.  \nRead the block colors **left \u2192 right**; keep duplicates.  \nThis produces a cyclic sequence used to color the line, one cell per step.\n\nExamples:\n- blocks `2,2,8` \u21d2 repeat `2,2,8,2,2,8,...`\n- blocks `4,1` \u21d2 repeat `4,1,4,1,...`\n\n**Test:** the top-left blocks are `3,3,3,6` \u21d2 palette cycle = **[3,3,3,6]**.\n\n#### 2) Find the \u201cturn/junction\u201d color\nA separate small block (in the lower-right area) uses one extra color;

My process involves analyzing the examples and looking for consistent structures that allow me to predict the output.\n\nInitial observations suggested an image that was \"cut\" and partially obscured with a specific background colour to be inferred.\nI started by analyzing the first example and noticing the two \"objects\" which had a similar background color (3) and features (2 and 8, or 4), separated by a region of zeros. The output showed these two objects \"collided\" or \"merged\" after removing the gap in the input. In the second example the background was split into regions 2 and 8. The shapes inside each regions of were still preserved but \"collided\" in such a way.  It was clear that the structure of the examples involved some sort of  transform.\n\nI considered transformations such as rotation, translation, or mirroring. However, the examples had objects overlapping, but not colliding in the usual sense.\n\nBy analyzing the example input grids and output images, I realized that the transformations in each example had some recurring patterns. I tried to figure out a \"re-assembling\" method with all examples by analyzing and figuring out the features within the images.\n\nThe Test Input is a 30x30 image with two background colors (8 and 9) and features (3, 6, 7). The initial view had me see some diagonal bands that were key for the problem.\n\nBased on insights from the examples, a specific pattern \"8,3,3\" was established along the top, and a new structure appeared at the bottom (\"7,7\" on an 8 background). This setup was very similar to the first example with \"3,2,2\" on an empty background.\nThe second, third, and fourth examples showed a more detailed and clearer picture of the re-assembly logic, and it was clear that a \"pattern completion\" operation was necessary.\nA 30 x 30 grid means a symmetric split.\nThe rows are swapped such as the top rows fill the bottom and bottom rows fill the top.\nThe original \"9\" regions in the Test Input are re-assigned to the background colour \"8\".\nI focused my attention on the test input, which was a 30 x 30 grid with specific patterns. The two backgrounds were separated by a large band (the 9s). It became clear that the objective was to \"un-scramble\" the input to form a more complete image.\nI realized that if I swapped the top and bottom halves of the image (rows 0-14 with 15-29), the patterns would merge.\nFurther, as the regions with the background 9 were empty, the task was to fill the new regions with a specific colour to remove \"gaps\".\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  **Swap:** Divide the grid into two halves. Move top (rows 0-14) to bottom (rows 15-29), and bottom (rows 15-29) to top (rows 0-14).\n2.  **Color Replacement:** Replace all pixels with the value '9' with the value '8'.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1**: The input contains two distinct \"objects\" or \"fragments\" on a background of 3 (green) and 0 (black). The objects are in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants. The transformation effectively **swaps the top and bottom halves** of the grid (shifting by half the grid height). The background 0s (\"void\") are mostly filled in with the dominant background color (3), and the features from the top-left (2s, 8s) move to the bottom-left, while features from the bottom-right (4s) move to the top-right.\n2.  **Example 2**: The input shows a continuous pattern split by a diagonal boundary between background 2 and background 8. The output reconstructs a single consistent texture/pattern. The logic aligns with a toroidal shift or a rearrangement of the grid to merge the fragments.\n3.  **General Pattern**: The tasks involve identifying \"void\" or \"occluded\" regions and \"active\" regions, and then rearranging the active regions (often by swapping halves or shifting) to form a complete, coherent image. The \"void\" color is replaced by the main background color.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n-   **Grid Size**: 30x30.\n-   **Structure**:\n    -   **Top Half (Rows 0-14)**: Contains an object with features 3 (green) and 6 (magenta) on a background of 8 (azure). The top-right corner is filled with 9s (maroon).\n    -   **Bottom Half (Rows 15-29)**: Contains an object with feature 7 (orange) on a background of 8. The bottom-left corner is filled with 9s.\n-   **Interpretation**: The 8s represent the valid background with objects. The 9s represent the \"void\" or \"gap\" (analogous to 0s in Example 1). The valid parts are in the Top-Left and Bottom-Right.\n-   **Transformation**:\n    1.  **Swap Halves**: Move the Top Half (Rows 0-14) to the bottom (Rows 15-29) and the Bottom Half (Rows 15-29) to the top (Rows 0-14). This moves the Top-Left object to the Bottom-Left and the Bottom-Right object to the Top-Right, filling the voids.\n    2.  **Fill Void**: Replace all instances of the void color (9) with the active background color (8).\n\n**Step-by-Step Construction:**\n1.  **Output Rows 0-14**: Take Input Rows 15-29. Replace all 9s with 8s.\n    -   Example: Input Row 25 contains `...8,8,8,7,7,8,8...`. This moves to Output Row 10. The `7,7` feature is preserved.\n2.  **Output Rows 15-29**: Take Input Rows 0-14. Replace all 9s with 8s.\n    -   Example: Input Row 1 contains `8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6...`. This moves to Output Row 16. The `3`s and `6`s are preserved.\n3.  **Ghost Features**: Some `3`s appearing in the 9-regions (e.g., Row 14, 26) are preserved and moved accordingly, appearing on the new 8-background.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n-   Background will be entirely 8.\n-   Feature `7,7` from Input Row 25 (Col 24,25) moves to Output Row 10.\n-   Features `3,3` and `6,6` from Input Row 1 (Col 1-11) move to Output Row 16.\n-   Other rows are processed similarly.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 5>\n<CANDIDATE 6>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n888888888888888888888888888888\n833833833866888888888888888888\n833833833866888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888877\n888838888888888888888888888877\n338338668888888888888888888338\n338338668888888888888888888338\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888778888\n388888888888888888888888778888\n388888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_4_step_3\">\n**Algorithm for Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the task looks like a \"mosaic\" or \"tile reconstruction\" problem. My main goal is to figure out how the different colored regions relate to each other in the given examples and then apply the logic to the test case. The core idea is that the provided input is just a partial view of a larger, repeating pattern, and the goal is to \"complete\" the image by extrapolating the underlying periodicity.\n\nHere's how I'm approaching it:\n\n1.  **Identify the Background and Foreground**: First, I'll need to figure out what color represents the \"gap\" or \"missing data\" (background), and what color(s) represent the actual image (foreground).\n\n2.  **Look for Periodic Structures**: The core of this problem is to find a repeating unit or shift vector. I'm going to look at the decorations and pixel arrangements, and how they repeat. The examples show patterns that are shifted, but might not be an exact direct copy. They are shifted relative to some \"cut\" or \"gap\".\n\n3.  **Find the Shift Vector**: Now it's time to actually find how to apply the discovered periodicity. I will be looking for a shift vector `(dy, dx)` (vertical and horizontal shift) that relates the disconnected image pieces. For example, by matching points in the foreground across the gap, or by identifying how the gaps, or boundaries, are positioned. I will test these shift vectors, to ensure they don't break the pattern.\n\n4.  **Fill the Gaps**:  Then, the actual algorithm to apply. I will use the identified shift vector(s) to \"fill\" the gaps or missing sections by copying pixels from the existing regions to the empty ones. Specifically, the strategy is this: for every gap pixel, find a valid source pixel from the input using the shift. We are trying to preserve the input \"decorations\" and \"background.\"  Priority is: Decoration > 8 > Gap. We can get these through two shifts:\n\n    1.  `(y, x) -> (y+13, x-4)` (BR)\n    2.  `(y, x) -> (y-13, x+4)` (TL)\n\nI'm focusing on preserving the foreground decorations as they are present in the provided input, and will only consider the background/gap pixels as the \"thing to fill\".\n\n5.  **Output**: Finally, I output the complete grid by filling the gaps following this process!\n\n\nBased on the solved examples, the task is to reconstruct a periodic image from a grid that contains two disjoint fragments separated by a \"gap\" (represented by a specific background color, here 9). The reconstruction involves finding the translational symmetry (shift vector) that aligns the two fragments and filling the gap with the pattern extended from the visible regions.\n\n**Analysis of the Test Input:**\n- **Grid Size:** 30x30.\n- **Background/Gap Color:** 9 (Maroon).\n- **Foreground Color:** 8 (Azure).\n- **Decorations:**\n  - Top-Left (TL) region (Rows 1-2) contains sequences of 3s (Green) and 6s (Magenta).\n    - Pattern: `3,3` at cols 1-2, 4-5, 7-8; `6,6` at cols 10-11.\n  - Bottom-Right (BR) region (Rows 25-26) contains 7s (Orange).\n    - Pattern: `7,7` at cols 24-25.\n  - There are isolated 3s at R14 C0 and R26 C0.\n\n**Step-by-Step Derivation:**\n1.  **Identify Shift Vector:**\n    By comparing the positions of the 3s in the TL region `(1, 4)` and the 3 at `(14, 0)`, we can deduce a shift vector `v = (13, -4)`.\n    - `(1, 4) + (13, -4) = (14, 0)`. Matches input.\n    - Let's verify with other points.\n    - If we apply `v` to the TL decorations, they fall into the gap of the middle region (Rows 14-15).\n    - If we apply `-v` (inverse shift) to the BR decorations, they fall into the gap of the middle/upper region (Rows 12-13).\n\n2.  **Fill the Gap (Rows 12-15):**\n    - **Propagate TL Decorations (`v = +13, -4`):**\n      - `3,3` at `(1,1)-(1,2)` -> `(14,27)-(14,28)`.\n      - `3,3` at `(1,4)-(1,5)` -> `(14,0)-(14,1)`. (Note: `(14,0)` is already 3).\n      - `3,3` at `(1,7)-(1,8)` -> `(14,3)-(14,4)`.\n      - `6,6` at `(1,10)-(1,11)` -> `(14,6)-(14,7)`.\n      - Repeat for Row 2 -> Row 15.\n    - **Propagate BR Decorations (`v = -13, +4`):**\n      - `7,7` at `(25,24)-(25,25)` -> `(12,28)-(12,29)`.\n      - `7,7` at `(26,24)-(26,25)` -> `(13,28)-(13,29)`.\n      - `3` at `(26,0)` -> `(13,4)`.\n\n3.  **Fill Remaining Gaps:**\n    - `R27 C0`: Propagate from `R14 C4` (which is filled with 3). `(14,4) + (13,-4) = (27,0)`. So `R27 C0` becomes 3.\n    - All other pixels with value 9 are filled with the foreground color 8.\n\n**Constructed Output Details:**\n- **Rows 0-11:** 9s become 8s. TL decorations remain.\n- **Row 12:** C28,29 become 7. Rest of 9s become 8.\n- **Row 13:** C4 becomes 3. C28,29 become 7. Rest of 9s become 8.\n- **Row 14:** C1 becomes 3; C3,4 become 3; C6,7 become 6; C27,28 become 3. Rest of 9s become 8.\n- **Row 15:** Same pattern as R14.\n- **Rows 16-24:** 9s become 8s.\n- **Row 25:** 9s become 8s.\n- **Row 26:** 9s become 8s.\n- **Row 27:** C0 becomes 3. Rest of 9s become 8.\n- **Rows 28-29:** 9s become

model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_3\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the following transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Template Pattern**: In the top-left corner, there's a template of 2x2 blocks defining a repeating pattern.\n2. **Markers**: Single colored cells (same color as first template block) appear elsewhere in the grid.\n3. **Special Block**: A 2x2 block in another region indicates the \"endpoint\" color.\n4. **Fill Region**: There are two distinct regions (like the irregular boundaries between colors).\n\n**The transformation:**\n- Erase the template and special block (replace with background)\n- From each marker, draw lines through the \"fill region\" using the template pattern\n- At boundaries where lines meet the background region, place the special color\n\n**For the test input:**\n- Template: 3,3,3,6 pattern (from 2x2 blocks at rows 1-2)\n- Markers: 3 at positions (14,0) and (26,0)\n- Special block: 7,7 at (25-26, 24-25)\n- Fill region: 9 (maroon), Background: 8 (gray)\n- Pattern drawn through 9-region, endpoints marked with 7\n\nThe pattern radiates from markers horizontally and vertically through the 9-region, with 7 marking boundaries.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,7,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_11_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n**Analysis of an ARC Problem**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. I'm given three examples to understand how to solve an ARC problem. The user has provided an input grid, and I need to figure out what transformation needs to be applied. The problem involves a grid of integers, representing colors.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the inputs. The description mentions backgrounds, tracks, and objects with repeating patterns, called \"Patterned Sequences\" along tracks, which can have \"Markers\".\n\nMy job is to interpret the rules and apply them.\n\nRule 1 is about the \"Pattern\". It says to examine the top-left 2x2 color blocks to build a sequence. In the first example, this gave a `2,2,8` sequence. In the second, `4,1`, and the third gave `2,2,3`. These sequences are critical, and I've now correctly worked out that they correspond to the colors of distinct 2x2 blocks of similar color, appearing left to right, distinct from the background (which is usually a big field, or sea, of a single color in each example).\n\nRule 2 and 3 focus on \"markers\". I see these as small isolated blocks of color, which define a \"terminal marker\" color, used to erase parts of the input. I see these appearing at the terminal points on the output.\n\nRule 4 is about path traversal, a staircase: \"maximal right run, then maximal up run\". These are the main transformations. But I see that the problem has an initial \"start pixel\", and it must be a single location with the first color of the pattern.\n\nI must trace the track which has turns and runs, and apply the pattern to the track, changing the track at each point.\n\nI have found, after carefully working through, that at the *blocking cells*, at the turns, at the end of runs, the \"Marker\" is placed. I see that the track can continue even if the path has to go *into* a background of a different color. That means I have to follow the instructions carefully to trace that path.\n\nIn summary, the key elements are:\n\n1.  *Pattern Extraction*: find distinct, top-left blocks; the colors in order defines a sequence.\n2.  *Marker Definition*: identify a marker color that shows up as the color to paint the turns.\n3.  *Pathfinding*: a \"Staircase\" movement, but potentially going through background, and potentially looping back.\n4.  Apply the pattern to those parts of the track, applying markers correctly to the blocking or terminal cells at run ends (turns), which means applying a Marker color to the track when the track dead ends.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, we first identify the objects and roles as described in the instructions.\n\n**1. Pattern Identification:**\nWe examine the top-left area of the input grid to find the 2x2 blocks of color that define the repeating pattern.\n*   **Row 1**: Contains sequences like `8, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6...`.\n*   We identify the blocks distinct from the background/track (8) as three blocks of `3,3` and one block of `6,6`.\n*   Reading left-to-right, the pattern sequence is: **[3, 3, 3, 6]**.\n*   The **Start Color** is the first color of the pattern: **3**.\n\n**2. Terminal Marker Identification:**\nWe look for a separate 2x2 block of a distinct color.\n*   Near the bottom-right (Rows 26-27, Cols 24-25), we find a block of **7**s (`7,7`).\n*   The **Terminal Marker Color** is **7**.\n\n**3. Erasures:**\n*   The pattern blocks (`3,3` and `6,6` in Rows 1-2) are erased (repainted to the surrounding background color, **8**).\n*   The terminal marker block (`7,7` in Rows 26-27) is erased (repainted to **8**).\n\n**4. Track Traversal and Coloring:**\nThe \"track\" is the path of **9**s carved into the background of **8**s (or vice-versa, but the 9s form the winding paths connected to the start pixels). We look for start pixels matching the Start Color (**3**) and traverse the track of 9s using the staircase rule (Maximal Right, then Maximal Up).\n\n*   **Path 1:** Starts at **(14, 0)** (Color 3).\n    *   **Run Right**: (14,0) to (14,6). Pattern `3,3,3,6,3,3,3`.\n        *   Blocked by 8 at (14,7). Paint (14,7) -> **7**.\n    *   **Turn Up**: (14,6) to (7,6). Pattern `6,3,3,3,6,3,3`.\n        *   Blocked by 8 at (6,6). Paint (6,6) -> **7**.\n    *   **Turn Right**: (7,6) to (7,23). Pattern `3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3`.\n        *   Blocked by 8 at (7,24). Paint (7,24) -> **7**.\n    *   **Turn Up**: Attempt from (7,23). Blocked immediately by 8 at (6,23). Paint (6,23) -> **7**.\n    *   **Dead End**: Cannot go Right either. Paint last track cell (7,23) -> **7**.\n\n*   **Path 2:** Starts at **(26, 0)** (Color 3).\n    *   **Run Right**: (26,0) to (26,10). Pattern `3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3`.\n        *   Blocked by 8 at (26,11). Paint (26,11) -> **7**.\n    *   **Turn Up**: (26,10) to (18,10). Pattern `6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3`.\n        *   Blocked by 8 at (17,10). Paint (17,10) -> **7**.\n    *   **Turn Right**: (18,10) to (18,26). Pattern `6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3`.\n        *   Blocked by 8 at (18,27). Paint (18,27) -> **7**.\n    *   **Turn Up**: (18,26) to (8,26). Pattern `6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3`.\n        *   Blocked by 8 at (7,26). Paint (7,26) -> **7**.\n    *   **Turn Right**: (8,26) to (8,29).

I need to take a large input grid, understand the underlying transformation logic, and then apply it to the new test input to generate the correct output.\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation:** First, I need to understand the relationship between the examples and the provided object/transformation descriptions.  It involves identifying key elements: the background colors, tracks (winding paths),  \"template\" blocks that define a repeating pattern, a \"terminal-marker color,\" and the \"start pixel(s)\". The central concept seems to be a \"staircase\" traversal along tracks.\n\n2.  **Detailed Analysis of the Transformations in Examples:** I'll thoroughly analyze each example. I have to read the input grids carefully. I need to locate where those 2x2 blocks are, what defines \"track color\", \"terminal-markers\", and how the staircase algorithm operates (maximal right, maximal up). My aim is to derive and verify the step-by-step logic through manual inspection. I also need to verify that those starting/terminal points are really present in the corresponding input. I'll test each leg of the trajectory and the final \"marker\" location in the examples.\n\n3.  **Algorithmic Formulation:** I'll formalize the process. The algorithm involves: (1) Reading the Top Left Blocks to define the pattern. (2) Reading and erasing the terminal marker. (3) Finding the start pixel. (4) Identifying the Track color. (5) Traversing the track in a staircase manner using the pattern and marking the wall. (6) Performing the pattern colorings and wall marking.\n\n4.  **Application to the Test Input:** I will then apply my understanding to the 30x30 test input. First, I need to locate the template markers, the terminal marker and single start pixel on the provided input. Finally, I will construct a new grid, starting from the input, erasing the blocks and applying the defined coloring algorithm to identify the track and its correct pattern filling (and marking the correct cells).\n\n5.  **Output Generation:** Finally, I'll generate the resulting grid, ensuring the format (30x30 integers) is correct, and that all necessary transformations are applied in the correct order. The final result should look like the example's output.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we follow the transformation rules derived from the examples:\n\n1.  **Extract Pattern and Terminal Color**:\n    *   **Pattern**: Look at the small 2x2 blocks in the top-left area. In the test input, rows 1 and 2 contain blocks of `3,3` at columns 1-2, `3,3` at columns 4-5, `3,3` at columns 7-8, and `6,6` at columns 10-11. Reading these left-to-right gives the sequence **3, 3, 3, 6**.\n    *   **Erase Templates**: These blocks are erased (painted with the surrounding background color, which is **8**).\n    *   **Terminal Color**: Identify the distinct small block elsewhere. At rows 26-27, columns 24-25, there is a 2x2 block of `7,7`. The terminal color is **7**.\n    *   **Erase Terminal Marker**: This block is also erased (painted with background **8**).\n\n2.  **Identify Tracks and Start Pixels**:\n    *   Find single pixels matching the first pattern color (**3**).\n    *   **Start Pixel 1**: (14, 0).\n    *   **Start Pixel 2**: (27, 0).\n    *   For each start pixel, determine the \"track domain\" color by looking at the immediate right neighbor.\n        *   For (14,0), neighbor is (14,1) which is **9**. Track traverses 9s.\n        *   For (27,0), neighbor is (27,1) which is **9**. Track traverses 9s.\n\n3.  **Traverse and Fill Tracks**:\n    *   **Method**: From the start pixel, move **Right** until blocked (non-9 cell), then mark the blocking cell with the terminal color (**7**). Then move **Up** from the last track cell until blocked, mark the blocking cell, and turn Right again. Repeat.\n    *   **Coloring**: Fill the traversed cells with the repeating pattern `3, 3, 3, 6`. The start pixel is index 0.\n\n    **Track 1 Trace (Start 14,0):**\n    *   **Right**: (14,0) to (14,15). Blocked at (14,16). Mark (14,16)=7.\n        *   Sequence indices 0-15: `3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6`.\n    *   **Up**: (14,15) to (1,15). Blocked at (0,15). Mark (0,15)=7.\n        *   Sequence indices 16-29: (Starts with 3). Ends at (1,15) with 3.\n    *   **Right**: (1,15) to (1,21). Blocked at (1,22). Mark (1,22)=7.\n        *   Sequence indices 30-35. Ends at (1,21) with 3.\n    *   **Up**: (1,21) to (0,21). Blocked by grid edge (no wall above 0, or implied boundary). However, (0,22) is adjacent right.\n        *   Sequence index 36? Wait, pattern continues. (0,21) gets 6.\n        *   Next step Right from (0,21) hits (0,22) which is 8 (wall). Mark (0,22)=7.\n\n    **Track 2 Trace (Start 27,0):**\n    *   **Right**: (27,0) to (27,9). Blocked at (27,10). Mark (27,10)=7.\n        *   Indices 0-9. Ends with 3.\n    *   **Up**: (27,9) to (18,9). Blocked at (17,9). Mark (17,9)=7.\n        *   Indices 10-18. Ends with 3.\n    *   **Right**: (18,9) to (18,27). Blocked at (18,28). Mark (18,28)=7.\n        *   Indices 19-36. Ends with 3.\n    *   **Up**: (18,27) to (7,27). Blocked at (6,27). Mark (6,27)=7.\n        *   Indices 37-47. Ends with 6.\n    *   **Right**: (7,27) to (7,29). Hit edge.\n        *   Indices 48-49.

Read them **left to right** and record their colors (including repeats).  \n   In the test grid these blocks are: **3, 3, 3, 6**, so the repeating pattern is:  \n   **[3, 3, 3, 6]**\n\n2) **Erase the pattern templates**  \n   Repaint those 2\u00d72 blocks to the surrounding background color (here, **8**).\n\n3) **Find the terminal-marker color**  \n   Locate the separate small solid block elsewhere (here it is a **2\u00d72 block of 7**).  \n   Its color (**7**) is the terminal-marker color. Erase that block too (repaint to **8**).\n\n4) **Traverse each track from each start pixel**  \n   Find every **single pixel** whose color equals the **first pattern color** (here, **3**) and treat each as a start.  \n   From each start, the track color is the color it continues through (here it is **9**). Traverse in a staircase:\n   - go **as far right as possible** through track cells,\n   - then **as far up as possible**,\n   - repeat until stuck.\n\n5) **Recolor the traversed track cells**  \n   As you traverse, recolor visited track cells in order using the repeating pattern **[3,3,3,6]**, continuing across turns.\n\n6) **Place terminal markers at run ends**  \n   Whenever a run stops because the next cell is not track color:\n   - after a right-run, color the blocking cell **to the right** as **7**\n   - after an up-run, color the blocking cell **above** as **7**\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,9,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,7,8,7,8,9,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,6,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,7,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 11>\n<CANDIDATE 12>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n888888888888888899999988888888\n888888888888888999999988888888\n888888888888889999999988888888\n888888888888899999999888888888\n888888888899999933833833866888\n888888899999999933833833866888\n888899999999999999999999888899\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999988888899999999\n899999988888888888888899999998\n999999888888888888888899999998\n998888888888888888999999999988\n888888888888999399999999999988\n888888889999999999999999999888\n888888899999999999999999999888\n999999999999999999999999998888\n999999999999999999999999988888\n999999999999999999999999888888\n999999999999999999999998888888\n999999999999999999988888888888\n999999999999999888888888888888\n899999999998888888888888888888\n999999999988888888888888888888\n999999999888888888888888888888\n999999998778888888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n**Analysis and Synthesis of ARC Task: Image Transformation**\n\nMy immediate task is to tackle an ARC problem that involves understanding and replicating image transformations. The problem presents examples of input grids and corresponding outputs, and my goal is to discern the underlying logic and apply it to a new input.\n\nMy initial approach is to analyze the simplest example. I begin by examining the grid sizes, color distributions, and visual patterns. The key observation is that the inputs often contain a \u201cbackground\u201d color and distinct, smaller patterns \u201cinclusions\u201d within them.\n\nI notice that the images appear to be composed of repeating blocks of pixels. Based on the patterns, I hypothesize that the task involves a *texture synthesis* process where a portion of the original texture (3) is moved to 0.\n\nBy analyzing the rows in Input 1 and Output 1, I observe what seems to be a rightward shift of patterns and, in some cases, the propagation or transfer of patterns from one region to another. My analysis suggests a translation of image components within the grid.\n\nTo be precise in describing the transformation, I look for fixed elements in both the input and output. I then extract the background map. I consider the possibility of a \"transparent overlay\". This leads me to believe the output image is a *composite* of a moving Pattern layer and a stationary Background.\n\nI then introduce the concept of Mask and Pattern layers. I test the hypothesis. I consider the Input, then formulate a Shift to derive the Output. I attempt to formulate general rules.\n\nThis leads me to the current hypothesis. In Example 2, the pattern of pixels that make up the image shift, so I focus on Example 2 and 3 and the provided Test Input to extract general rules. I note that each input/output combination shows distinct, though somewhat related, pattern transformations. I calculate the shift and consider the geometry of the blocks within the grid and note a periodicity of these blocks.\n\nThrough this analysis, I determine a general algorithm: The input will have at least two regions within a grid, each with a Background color, and the goal is to shift the smaller pattern from one region into the other to generate the Output. This involves:\n\n1.  Identifying the Background regions and outlier pixels.\n2.  Extracting the \"shift\" factor for row and columns by examining at least two example images.\n3.  Synthesizing (drawing) a new pattern on the empty region (or, more precisely, on the target/second region, and leaving the first region blank).\n\nIn this process, I carefully account for grid boundaries by performing \"wrap-around\" shifts and examine the outlier pixel in each grid to estimate shift. After multiple checks with test values, I use an estimated shift based on each outlier pixel to build the output grid.\n\n\nThe problem involves extracting a pattern from a \"source\" background region and propagating it to a \"destination\" background region with a specific spatial shift.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Decomposition into Background and Pattern:**\n    *   **Backgrounds:** Each grid consists of two dominant colors defining large regions.\n        *   Example 1: Color 3 (green) and Color 0 (black).\n        *   Example 2: Color 2 (red) and Color 8 (teal).\n        *   Example 3: Color 1 (blue) and Color 4 (yellow).\n        *   Test Input: Color 8 (teal) and Color 9 (maroon).\n    *   **Pattern:** Small distinct colored pixels or blocks appear overlaid on the \"Source\" background (the one appearing in the top-left).\n        *   Example 1: 2, 8, 4 on Background 3.\n        *   Example 2: 4, 1, 9 on Background 2.\n        *   Example 3: 2, 3, 8 on Background 1.\n        *   Test Input: 3, 6, 7 on Background 8.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   The pattern is **removed** from the Source Background (leaving it clean).\n    *   The pattern is **transferred** to the Destination Background.\n    *   The transfer involves a **translation (shift)** of the pattern coordinates.\n    *   **Shift Calculation:**\n        *   Comparing the positions of specific pattern elements (e.g., the \"outlier\" single blocks like the 4 in Ex 1, 9 in Ex 2, 8 in Ex 3, 7 in Test) or the start of the repeating blocks.\n        *   Example 1 (20x20): Shift is `(+3, +12)`.\n        *   Example 2 (25x25): Shift is `(+2, +13)`.\n        *   Example 3 (25x25): Shift is `(+3, +19)`.\n    *   **Inference for Test Input (30x30):**\n        *   The row shift `dr` appears to be `+3` (consistent with Ex 1 and Ex 3).\n        *   The column shift `dc` appears to be half the grid width (`W/2`), or related to centering the pattern in the destination region.\n        *   For 20x20, `dc=12` (approx half). For 25x25, `dc=13` (approx half).\n        *   For 30x30, we assume `dc = 15`.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Source:** Background 8. **Destination:** Background 9.\n    *   **Pattern Elements in Source:**\n        *   Rows 1 and 2: `3,3` at cols 1, 4, 7; `6,6` at col 10.\n        *   Row 14: `3` at col 0.\n        *   Row 26: `7,7` at cols 24, 25.\n        *   Row 27: `3` at col 0.\n    *   **Apply Shift `(dr=+3, dc=+15)`:**\n        *   **Rows 1 & 2** shift to **Rows 4 & 5**.\n            *   `3,3` at `1+15=16`. (Cols 16, 17)\n            *   `3,3` at `4+15=19`. (Cols 19, 20)\n            *   `3,3` at `7+15=22`. (Cols 22, 23)\n            *   `6,6` at `10+15=25`.

I'm faced with this ARC task, and my mind's already racing, trying to get a handle on it. It's a grid, and it seems like there are patterns hidden within it. First, I'm just trying to understand the basic structure. There's a background, which seems to be black (0), and then there's this path or river made of green (3s). What\u2019s inside the river? There are these different colored pixels, and it's starting to look like these pixels have something to do with the overall structure. Okay, so I'm trying to see if this path is somehow shifted and what the shift is.\n\nNow, I'm starting to notice that there are maybe two different patterns that overlap, but I still have to figure out how they relate. This path that's made of green (3s), seems to wind throughout the whole grid. I'm focusing on trying to compare the Input and the Output, and I'm really looking at where the changes are happening. If I look closely at the Input and Output for the Example 1, it looks like this \"tape\" is changing, and the content is shifted or repeated.\n\nI\u2019m starting to think this is a shape-based problem, but how are the colors changing, and what is the underlying rule? I\u2019m thinking there is something about a continuous ribbon or a 1D sequence that's winding through the 2D grid. The foreground, which is anything other than the background, seems like it's forming a single component. I can see the connectivity, which could define the shape. It seems like the foreground pixels form a single 1D sequence that winds through the 2D grid, so the transformation is happening in this 1D space.\n\nI'm thinking, is this a shift along a ribbon? To figure this out, I need to look at the width of the path. If I unroll the path, is there an order? Standard snake order? I start looking at how the empty space works to see if there is a pattern. It looks like parts of the image are separated, and this is where I start thinking this is more complicated than a straight shift. And where do the colors change? I\u2019m looking at the output, and now the colors have shifted position.\n\nNow, I\u2019m thinking that this might be a single continuous tape.  I\u2019m considering: maybe the entire grid is just a raster scan of a long string. So I form the algorithm hypothesis. The goal is to figure out the color transformation on this 1D array, and I want to see if the colors are being shifted or reversed.\n\nI\u2019m focusing on Example 1: I see the sequence of foreground pixels, and it seems like these pixels in the output are shifted and repeating. There seems to be cyclic shift here, and what is the direction? Where did it come from? The pattern is not matching up perfectly: the 3s are interrupting the pattern. Are the 3s part of the sequence, or are they transparent? It looks like the pattern ignores the 3s?\n\nLet's test the 3s, are they part of the shift? Yes, the 3s are shifted along with the other colors, so they are part of the stream. What is the shift amount? If it's the shift, is the shape of this ribbon being compressed? What is the order? Now I\u2019m thinking, this might be a spiral or snake, and I start looking at how the rows are connected.\n\nNow, I\u2019m seeing that the pixel counts change. This is not a permutation or shift.  The rule must be more complex, and I'm thinking about a pattern. It looks like there are two patterns for these images. Maybe it's a SWAP of regions: in the input, the top contains the A pattern, and the bottom contains the B pattern, and in the output, it switches.\n\nLet's check Example 2: there is a region with 2s and another region with 8s. It turns out that there is more complex pattern-shifting or flow, so now I'm starting to think the path can be more like the region itself, and the color change comes from the region. I need to be more precise about the shift.\n\nNow, I'm getting a little more clarity: I need a \"Carrier\" and a \"Payload\". It\u2019s all about the transformation of the payload. So I go back to Example 1, focusing on the reading order, and I'm seeing that it is a cyclic shift. Let\u2019s double-check with Example 2, and what I\u2019m seeing is that there is a cyclic shift along the path. \n\nThis makes me re\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by identifying a sequence of \"payload\" patterns embedded in a path or regions, and then applying a transformation to that sequence. Based on the solved examples, the transformation is a **reversal of the sequence of payload blocks** defined by the connected components (regions) of the grid.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Decomposition:** The grid is composed of \"Background\" regions and \"Payload\" pixels.\n    *   **Regions:** These are large connected areas of a single color. In the test input, we have regions of **8** (Teal) and **9** (Maroon).\n    *   **Components:** We identify the regions in standard reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right based on first appearance).\n        1.  **C1 (Top-Left 8s):** Contains payload `3`s and `6`s.\n        2.  **C2 (Middle 9s):** This large region acts as a container. It contains a large block of `8`s (which is payload, as it's inside the 9-region) and scattered `3`s.\n        3.  **C3 (Top-Right 8s):** Contains no payload.\n        4.  **C4 (Bottom-Right 8s):** Contains payload `7`s.\n    *   **Payload:** The non-background pixels within each component.\n        *   $P(C1)$: Pairs of `3`s and `6`s. Sequence: `3,3, 3,3, 3,3, 6,6, 6,6`. (16 pixels).\n        *   $P(C2)$: The `8` block and `3`s. Sequence: `8`s (approx 40), `3`s (3 pixels).\n        *   $P(C3)$: Empty.\n        *   $P(C4)$: Pairs of `7`s. Sequence: `7,7, 7,7` (4 pixels).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:** The sequence of payload blocks is **reversed**.\n    *   Original Component Order: C1, C2, C3, C4.\n    *   Original Payload Sequence: $P(C1) \\to P(C2) \\to P(C3) \\to P(C4)$.\n    *   Transformed Payload Sequence: $P(C4) \\to P(C3) \\to P(C2) \\to P(C1)$.\n\n3.  **Application:** We fill the *original payload slots* of the components with the *new payload sequence*.\n    *   **Fill C1 Slots:** The slots originally holding `3`s and `6`s (16 slots) are filled first.\n        *   Source: $P(C4)$ (`7`s) then start of $P(C2)$ (`8`s).\n        *   The 4 `7` pixels fill the first 4 slots (Row 1's `3,3`, `3,3`).\n        *   The `8` pixels (from the start of the `8` block in C2) fill the remaining 12 slots. Since `8` is the background color of C1, these pixels effectively disappear (become background). There is one isolated `3` from the C2 payload stream that lands in C1 (at Row 2, Slot 3), but generally, the rest become 8.\n    *   **Fill C2 Slots:** The slots originally holding the `8` block and `3`s.\n        *   Source: Remainder of $P(C2)$ then $P(C1)$.\n        *   The remaining `8`s fill the beginning of the `8` block slots.\n        *   When `8`s run out, the slots are filled with $P(C1)$ content: `3`s then `6`s.\n        *   This means the end of the `8` block (around Row 17) and the scattered `3` slots will turn into `3`s and `6`s.\n    *   **Fill C4 Slots:** The slots originally holding `7`s (4 slots).\n        *   Source: End of $P(C1)$ (`6`s).\n        *   The `7,7` pixels become `6,6`.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\n*   **Row 1:** The `3,3` `3,3` become `7,7` `7,7`. The remaining `3,3` `6,6` become `8,8` `8,8`.\n*   **Row 2:** The `3,3` `3,3` `3,3` `6,6` become `8,8` `8,8` `3,8` `8,8` (due to the single `3` in the stream).\n*   **Row 17:** The bottom of the `8` block turns into `3`s.\n*   **Row 26/27:** The `7,7` become `6,6`.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,7,7,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_8_step_5_image\">\n**Problem Breakdown and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I have to solve for a pattern using three examples and a single test input. It looks like each grid represents some sort of color-coded environment with source points, destination points, and obstacles.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Understanding:**\nI need to examine the grid and its corresponding output. I am mapping the numbers in the grid to their respective colors. From Example 1, I can see a \"path\" being constructed in the output and I must identify the start point which is a block of colors (2, 8). Destination is at a block with color 4 (Yellow) and is positioned far from the source. I can see the \"path\" is a connecting line between the source and destination. The path has some specific color-based pattern: in the output sequence of Example 1, it's a repeating pattern of colors. Specifically, the color pattern is Red, Teal, Yellow. It seems the input defines a shape.  From that shape, the Output is a path. The output shapes are color coded to the input shape colors.\n\n**Identifying the Core Logic:**\nAfter carefully studying the different examples, I deduce that the crucial part is identifying the sources and their colors. These sources seem to initiate paths within the grid. The paths follow a specific structure: a repeating color-coded \"bus\" or \"snake\" (In other words, the path is a repeating sequence of colors), which connects to a destination. The repeating sequence is just a repeating pattern, which can be seen in the Output Example grids. Then, looking at the examples, the destination's color will be included in the output path.\n\n**Path Construction and Pattern Detection:**\nIn each example, the source blocks are arranged horizontally, while the destination is at the bottom. By examining the examples, it is evident that the sequence of colors in the paths is determined by the input sources. I have discovered that the output always begins at the sources. For example, for example 1: Sources were (Red, Red, Teal), which translated to (2,2,8) which became the source in the output. Therefore, the goal is to get a generalized solution which will work for the test input.\n\n**Generalizing the Solution and Handling Edge Cases:**\nThe path always connects the input's source block to the output destination block, following the pattern derived from the examples. For the test input, The source and destinations are identified (the input is a grid with specified rows and columns), I am confident that I can replicate the logic used for the test input. The \"path\" will be constructed by replicating the same steps and processes. The task is to construct this path from the data provided in the test input. The path must go from the source and destination in the shortest path, while also following a specific sequence of colors (pattern) in the input grid provided.\n\n**Specifically:**\nFor the test Input, I need to analyze the data, determine the source and destination. Then construct the shortest path in the grid, such that the sequence of colors in the path is equal to the source color pattern. I have identified the source block and target in the test input, and will implement this approach with the data in hand. I am ready to generate the final output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to connect \"source\" ports to a \"destination\" port using a specific path pattern.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Identify Sources:** The sources are distinct colored blocks located on the boundary of a region (usually top-left). We extract the sequence of colors from these blocks.\n    *   Example 1: Red (`2`), Red (`2`), Cyan (`8`). Pattern length 3: `2, 2, 8`.\n    *   Example 2: Yellow (`4`), Blue (`1`). Pattern length 2: `4, 1`.\n    *   Example 3: Red (`2`), Red (`2`), Green (`3`). Pattern length 3: `2, 2, 3`.\n    *   **Test Input:** The sources are three Green (`3`) blocks and one Magenta (`6`) block. The sequence is Green, Green, Green, Magenta. Pattern length 4: `3, 3, 3, 6`.\n\n2.  **Identify Destination:** The destination is a colored block on the opposite side (usually bottom-right).\n    *   Test Input: The destination is an Orange (`7`) block located at rows 25-26, columns 24-25.\n\n3.  **Construct Path:** A path is drawn connecting the sources to the destination.\n    *   The path consists of the repeating color pattern derived from the sources.\n    *   The path geometry in the examples follows a \"Manhattan\" route: typically extending horizontally from the sources, then vertically to the destination row/column, then horizontally to the target.\n    *   The path width matches the width of the source blocks (2 pixels in the Test Input).\n    *   The path overwrites the \"void\" or background regions but stops adjacent to the destination.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Pattern:** `3, 3, 3, 6` (Green, Green, Green, Magenta).\n*   **Sources Location:** Rows 1-2, extending up to Column 11.\n*   **Destination Location:** Rows 25-26, Columns 24-25.\n*   **Routing:**\n    1.  **Horizontal Extension:** Extend the path from the end of the sources (Column 12) to the right, aligning with the destination column (Column 24). This covers Rows 1-2 from Column 12 to 23.\n    2.  **Vertical Extension:** Drop down from the horizontal extension to reach the destination. This covers Columns 24-25 from Row 1 down to Row 24 (stopping just above the target at Row 25).\n\n*   **Coloring Logic:**\n    *   The color at any coordinate `(r, c)` on the path follows the pattern cyclically based on the coordinate.\n    *   For the horizontal segment (Rows 1-2), the color corresponds to `c % 4`.\n        *   `c % 4 == 0` -> `3`\n        *   `c % 4 == 1` -> `3`\n        *   `c % 4 == 2` -> `3`\n        *   `c % 4 == 3` -> `6`\n    *   For the vertical segment (Cols 24-25), the color corresponds to `r % 4`.\n        *   `r % 4 == 0` -> `3`\n        *   `r % 4 == 1` -> `3`\n        *   `r % 4 == 2` -> `3`\n        *   `r % 4 == 3` -> `6`\n    *   This logic ensures the pattern flows continuously and matches the intersections correctly.\n\n**Resolution Steps:**\n1.  Copy the input grid.\n2.  Fill the region `Rows 1-2` and `Cols 12-23` with the pattern based on `col % 4`.\n3.  Fill the region `Rows 1-24` and `Cols 24-25` with the pattern based on `row % 4`.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,8,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,3,9,9,9\n3,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,3,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,6,6,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 16>\n<CANDIDATE 17>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n888888888888337999999988888888\n833833833866883999999988888888\n833833833866886999999988888888\n888888888888833999999888888888\n888888888899933999998888888888\n888888899999963999988888888888\n888899999999933999999999888899\n999999999999936999999999999999\n999999999999933999999999999999\n999999999999933999999999999999\n999999999999963999999999999999\n999999999999933999999999999999\n999999999999933999999999999999\n999999999999963988888899999999\n333633788888833888888899999998\n999999388888836888888899999998\n998888388888833889999999999988\n888888688888933999999999999988\n888888389999963999999999999888\n888888399999933999999999999888\n999999399999933999999999998888\n999999699999936999999999988888\n999999399999933999999999888888\n999999399999933999999998888888\n999999399999963999988888888888\n999999399973336333633363778888\n333633363378888888888888778888\n999999999988888888888888888888\n999999999888888888888888888888\n999999998888888888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_7_step_5_image\">\n**The core idea:** I'm being asked to solve an ARC puzzle where the solution involves drawing a path based on a repeating color pattern. The path connects \"start\" points (isolated pixels or small groups of pixels), to a target area (a larger colored block), while avoiding specific obstacles.\n\n**Here's my thought process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the examples:** I look at the provided inputs and outputs to discern the underlying logic. The goal is to figure out the rules governing how the path is constructed, how it's colored, and what determines its route. The focus is on the top-left section (the \"pattern\"), the starting points, the target, and any obstacles in the background. I pay close attention to the input grids and their corresponding output paths, meticulously trying to see the connections.\n\n2.  **Identify the repeating pattern:** I realize the key to the puzzle is a repeating sequence of colors. This sequence comes from the arrangement of colored blocks in the top-left area of the input grid. I note down the colors and the order to identify the pattern that drives the entire path.\n\n3.  **Find the starting points:** Based on the examples, I know the path will emerge from small, isolated blocks of color along the left edge of the grid. I try to understand the logic behind these start points.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the destination:** I recognize a specific, distinctly colored block that serves as the target or the ending point of the path. The path must navigate towards this target or potentially pass through it.\n\n5.  **Uncover the Pathfinding Logic:** I analyze the input and output grids to understand the rules for drawing the path. I observe that the path's route is shaped by the presence of obstacles (colored backgrounds in the grid) and perhaps the relative position of the start and end points. It seems that the path is determined by a boundary (or wall) between two distinct colors. The paths appear to expand from start locations and then connect by a vertical path, and then the vertical paths are linked to the goal.\n\n6.  **Deconstruct the Pattern:** The colors of each path segment are not random. The color sequence (originating from the top-left area) gets repeated along each section of the drawn path.\n\n7.  **Hypothesize the core rules:** I formulate the working hypothesis. It goes like this:\n\n    *   **The Legend:** The color sequence from the top-left determines the \"pattern\".\n    *   **The Start:** Starting pixels on the left.\n    *   **The Turn:** The path extends until it hits the boundary of a different color, which causes a \"turn.\" The turning point is where I'll use the Target Color.\n    *   **The Boundary Crawler:** The boundary will be traced. Vertical segments, etc. It seems to \"jump\" until at the target location.\n\n8.  **Test and Refine:** With this working hypothesis, I review the examples to see if the rules hold true. It's a game of pattern recognition, careful comparison of the input and the output, and constant refinement. It means confirming, testing, and modifying until a solid, replicable set of steps is in place for all scenarios.\n\n9.  **Translate to Code or Steps:** Once I have the algorithm, I need to generate the actual output grid. I plan to construct the path and fill the grid.\n\n10. **Apply to the Test Input:** I'll apply these steps to the new test input and generate the final output. The goal is to accurately draw the path based on the logic I've uncovered.\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we need to identify the rules governing the generation of paths based on the provided examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n1.  **Pattern Identification:**\n    *   In each example, there is a set of colored blocks in the top-left corner that acts as a \"Legend\" or \"Header\". This sequence of colors defines the repeating pattern of the path.\n    *   *Example 1:* Red (2), Red (2), Teal (8) $\\rightarrow$ Path Pattern: **2, 2, 8**.\n    *   *Example 2:* Yellow (4), Blue (1) $\\rightarrow$ Path Pattern: **4, 1**.\n    *   *Example 3:* Red (2), Red (2), Green (3) $\\rightarrow$ Path Pattern: **2, 2, 3**.\n    *   *Test Input:* Green (3), Green (3), Green (3), Magenta (6) $\\rightarrow$ Path Pattern: **3, 3, 3, 6**.\n\n2.  **Start Points:**\n    *   Paths originate from the \"Legend\" blocks themselves and from any single pixels on the left edge of the grid that match the first color of the pattern.\n    *   *Test Input:* Starts are at Row 14 (3) and Row 26 (3), plus the Legend path at Row 1.\n\n3.  **Target and Turns:**\n    *   There is a unique 2x2 block of a specific color in the grid that acts as the final destination.\n    *   *Example 1:* Yellow (4). *Example 2:* Dark Red (9). *Example 3:* Teal (8).\n    *   *Test Input:* The unique block is Orange (**7**) at the bottom right.\n    *   **Rule:** When a path turns or intersects a boundary, the turning pixel is colored with the Target color (7).\n\n4.  **Path Logic:**\n    *   **Horizontal Extension:** From each start point, extend a horizontal path to the right. The path consists of the repeating pattern colors.\n    *   **Stopping Condition:** The horizontal path stops when it encounters a \"Wall\" (a change in background color). The last cell of the path (the one before the wall) becomes a **Turn Point** and is colored with the Target color.\n    *   **Vertical Connection:** A vertical (or diagonal) path connects all the Turn Points. It follows the boundary of the regions (\"hugging the wall\") to connect the upper paths to the lower paths and finally to the Target block.\n    *   **Final Leg:** From the lowest Turn Point (aligned with the Target's row), the path shoots horizontally to the Target.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Legend:** 3, 3, 3, 6.\n2.  **Starts:**\n    *   **Row 1 (Legend):** Extends right through the Teal (8) region. Hits a Maroon (9) wall at Col 15. Turn point at **(1, 14)**.\n    *   **Row 14:** Starts at Col 0 (3). Extends right through Maroon (9) region. Hits a Teal (8) wall at Col 7. Turn point at **(14, 6)**.\n    *   **Row 26:** Starts at Col 0 (3). Extends right through Maroon (9) region. Hits a Teal (8) wall at Col 11. Turn point at **(26, 10)**.\n3.  **Target:** Orange (7) at **(25, 24)**.\n    *   The vertical connector must link (1,14) $\\rightarrow$ (14,6) $\\rightarrow$ (26,10).\n    *   Since the Target is at Row 25, the path will likely turn right from the vertical boundary at Row 25. The boundary at Row 25 matches Row 26 (Col 10). So there is a Turn Point at **(25, 10)**.\n    *   Final path goes from (25, 10) to Target at (25, 24).\n\n**Step-by-Step Path Construction:**\n\n*   **Row 14 Path:** Start 3. Pattern: 3,3,3,6.\n    *   (14,1):3, (14,2):3, (14,3):6, (14,4):3, (14,5):3.\n    *   (14,6): **7** (Turn).\n*   **Row 26 Path:** Start 3. Pattern: 3,3,3,6.\n    *   (26,1):3, (26,2):3, (26,3):6, (26,4):3, (26,5):3, (26,6):3, (26,7):6, (26,8):3, (26,9):3.\n    *   (26,10): **7** (Turn).\n*   **Row 1 Path:** Legend ends at 11. Path starts 12.\n    *   (1,12):3, (1,13):3.\n    *   (1,14): **7** (Turn).\n*   **Vertical Connections:**\n    *   Connect (1,14) to (14,6) following the boundary. The path uses the pattern sequence.\n    *   Connect (14,6) to (25,10) following the boundary.\n*   **Target Path (Row 25):**\n    *   Starts from turn at (25,10) which is **7**.\n    *   Goes right to (25,24).\n    *   Fills with pattern 3,3,3,6 starting from the correct offset.\n\n**Output Grid

an irregular diagonal boundary)\n2. **Pattern markers** (2x2 colored blocks) in one region define a repeating sequence\n3. **Anchor points** (single colored cells) exist in the other region\n4. **Destination marker** (another 2x2 block) marks where lines should connect\n5. **Lines are drawn** from anchors along the boundary between regions using the pattern sequence, with destination marker color at corners/endpoints\n\nFor the test input:\n- Main regions: gray (8) and yellow (9)\n- Pattern from 2x2 blocks: 3,3,3,6 (reading the unique colors)\n- Destination marker: 7 (bottom-right gray area)\n- Anchors: 3 at positions (14,0) and (26,0)\n\nThe transformation draws pattern lines through the yellow (9) region along its boundary with gray (8), using pattern 3,3,3,6 repeating, with 7 marking corners and endpoints.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,7,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,7,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,3,7,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_7_step_5_image\">\n### Inferred transformation\n\nEach puzzle has:\n- **Two big \u201cterrain\u201d colors** (one is the main background, the other is a large region).\n- A set of **small 2\u00d72 color blocks in the top-left**: these blocks (read **left\u2192right**) define a **repeating color sequence** used to draw \u201croads\u201d.\n- A **single 2\u00d72 block elsewhere** (often near the bottom-right): its color is a **cap/marker color** used at road endpoints and turns.\n- One or more **single cells on the left border** in the *first* sequence color: these are **road start points**.\n\n**Steps**\n1. **Read the road pattern**: scan the top-left 2\u00d72 blocks from left to right; record their colors as a sequence (duplicates kept).  \n2. **Read the cap color**: the lone 2\u00d72 block of a different color gives the cap color.\n3. **Erase the marker blocks**: replace all top-left 2\u00d72 pattern blocks and the 2\u00d72 cap-color block with the surrounding background color.\n4. **For each left-edge start cell**, draw one road through the large region adjacent to it (the cell immediately to its right gives the region color):\n   - Start moving **right**, then **up**, then **right**, then **up**, \u2026 (alternating).\n   - In each direction, continue through contiguous region cells until blocked.\n   - Color the traversed cells using the repeating sequence, **continuing the sequence across turns** (do not reset at turns).\n   - When a segment is blocked by a non-region cell **inside the grid**, place the **cap color** in that

Reading these blocks **left\u2192right** gives the **repeating road pattern** (duplicates matter).

This color is used for **corner markers** (turn/end markers), and that 2\u00d72 block is also removed (restored to the underlying terrain color).\n4) There are one or more **single cells on the left edge** in the **first palette color**. Each is a **start point**.\n5) From each start point, draw a **staircase path inside the terrain region that surrounds the start**:\n   - Go **right** through that region until the next cell would leave it. Color the traversed cells with the palette pattern, continuing the sequence across turns.\n   - If the stopping cell has an in-bounds neighbor to the right that is outside the region, color that outside cell with the **corner color**.\n   - Then go **up** from the endpoint as far as possible inside the region. If the cell above the topmost road cell is in-bounds and outside the region, color it with the corner color.\n   - Alternate **right, up, right, up\u2026** until you either (a) end a segment on the grid edge in the movement direction, or (b) after turning you cannot move even one step.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test\n- Terrain colors are **8 and 9**.\n- Palette blocks at top-left give pattern **[3, 3, 3, 6]**.\n- Corner-color block is **7** (2\u00d72 at rows 26\u201327, cols 24\u201325), so corners use **7**, and that block is removed to 8.\n- Start points (left edge, color 3): at **(15,0)** and **(27,0)**.\n- The region around each start is color **9**, so roads are drawn through the 9-region.\n\nResulting output grid:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,7,8,7,8,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,6,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 20>\n<CANDIDATE 21>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n888888888888888899999988888888\n833833833866888999999988888888\n833833833866889999999988888888\n888888888888899999999888888888\n888888888899999999998888888888\n888888899999999999988888888888\n888899999999999999999999888899\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999988888899999999\n763336788888888888888899999998\n699999388888888888888899999998\n398888388888888888999999999988\n388888688888999999999999999988\n388888889999999999999999999888\n688888899999999999999999999888\n399999999999999999999999998888\n399999939999999999999999988888\n399999939999999999999999888888\n699999939999999999999998888888\n399999939999999999988888888888\n399999969999999888888888778888\n733633799998888888888888778888\n999999999988888888888888888888\n999999999888888888888888888888\n999999998888888888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n**Solution Synthesis**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan for solving this ARC task. My goal is to transform the test input based on the rules I've deduced from analyzing the three examples. The core idea is that I'm dealing with drawing line structures that overlay a base image. Let me break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Pattern Extraction:** I begin by understanding that the top-left section of each input image contains the key to the line-drawing pattern. Specifically, I'm looking at the second row (index 1) of non-background colors. Within this row, these non-background colors will be grouped into distinct blocks/sequences. This sequence is then applied in the form of the line-drawing.\n\n2.  **Determining the Line Pattern:**  For each contiguous block of colors (i.e. if the background colour, '0', doesn't exist between a grouping of the same non-background colour), I take *one* pixel of that color, for use in the overall sequence. For example, if the top-left section has `2, 2, 8, 8`, the sequence extracted will be `2, 8`. From this, my goal is to derive the overall line drawing pattern.\n\n3.  **Initiating and Defining the Draw Path:** I look for the start markers. These are the pixels at the far left of the image. The line *begins* at the lone marker (single non-background color pixel) located on the left edge. I start drawing the pattern. To determine what is being drawn on, it is colour that exists *immediately* to the right of the lone marker.\n\n4.  **Implementing the Line-drawing Behavior:** The line follows the rule of drawing until it meets the background color or until I hit an \"obstacle\" - defined by a change in colour, meaning a change of the colour currently being drawn over.  It keeps drawing this pixel value until a change occurs (be it an interruption or the boundary of the image). At this point, I place the junction color and then change direction, continuing the pattern until another restriction is met.\n\n5.  **Handling Turns and Junctions:** The rule for turns is that they are all clockwise. Junctions are implemented on counter-clockwise changes.\n\n6.  **Overall Behavior:** The idea is to draw the lines, taking into consideration the rules above.\n\nIn summary, I look at the start marker, determine the sequence and start the line. The line stops at a junction/end-point (the junction color). Then, I repeat for as long as needed.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples, the transformation involves drawing a path or loop of colored lines over the image, driven by specific \"instruction\" markers and a \"palette\" of colors found in the input.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Pattern Palette**: The sequence of line colors is derived from the contiguous blocks of non-background colors in the second row (index 1) of the input grid.\n    *   In the test input, row 1 contains `8, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, ...` (with background 8).\n    *   The blocks are `3, 3` (Green), `3, 3` (Green), `3, 3` (Green), and `6, 6` (Magenta).\n    *   The repeating pattern unit is constructed by taking one pixel for each block: **`3, 3, 3, 6`**.\n\n2.  **Start Markers**: The drawing starts at the \"lone marker\" pixels found on the left edge (column 0).\n    *   In the test input, there are markers of color **3** at **(14, 0)** and **(26, 0)**.\n\n3.  **Path Tracing**: The lines are drawn starting from the markers. The direction is initially to the Right. The line overwrites the existing pixels (color 9) until it hits an \"obstacle\" (a different color, here 8).\n    *   Start at (26, 0). Move Right on 9s. Hit obstacle 8 at col 7. Stop at col 6.\n    *   Turn Left (Counter-Clockwise) because turning Right is blocked by edge/obstacle. New direction Up.\n    *   Move Up on 9s. Hit obstacle 8 at row 13. Stop at row 14.\n    *   Turn Left. New direction Left.\n    *   Move Left on 9s. Hit obstacle 3 (Start Marker) at col 0. Stop at col 0.\n    *   Turn Left. New direction Down.\n    *   Move Down on 9s. Hit obstacle 3 (Start Marker) at row 26. Stop at row 26.\n    *   This closes the loop. (Note: Starting at (14,0) and going Right would produce a Clockwise loop, but Example 1 suggests Junction markers appear at Left turns. A CCW loop produces Left turns at every corner).\n\n4.  **Junctions**: A \"Junction Marker\" is placed at corners where the path turns Left. The color is determined by the distinct 2x2 block in the lower-right area of the input.\n    *   In the test input, there is a block of **7**s (Orange) at (25, 24). So the Junction color is **7**.\n    *   The corners of the loop (14,0), (14,6), (26,6), (26,0) will be colored 7.\n\n5.  **Path Pattern Application**: The pattern `3, 3, 3, 6` is applied sequentially along the path (excluding the junction corners).\n    *   **Bottom Edge** (26, 1 to 26, 5): `3, 3, 6, 3, 3`.\n    *   **Right Edge** (25, 6 to 15, 6): `6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3`.\n    *   **Top Edge** (14, 5 to 14, 1): `6, 3, 3, 3, 6`.\n    *   **Left Edge** (15, 0 to 25, 0): `6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3`.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\nThe output is the input grid with the calculated loop drawn on it. The loop is defined by the corners (14,0), (14,6), (26,6), (26,0).\n\n*   Corners: (14,0), (14,6), (26,6), (26,0) -> **7**\n*   Row 14 (cols 1-5): `6, 3, 3, 3, 6`\n*   Row 26 (cols 1-5): `3, 3, 6, 3, 3`\n*   Col 0 (rows 15-25): `6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3`\n*   Col 6 (rows 15-25): `3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6` (Note: Sequence is reversed relative to drawing direction Up, so `3,3,6...` going down? No, Up was `6,3,3...`. Down is `...,3,3,6`.

I'll start by breaking down each example, trying to find consistent patterns and rules in how the input grids change into the outputs. I'll need to figure out the roles of different colored blocks, their placement, and how a path's color and direction is determined.  I am hoping to figure out the \"algorithm\".\n\n**Example Breakdown & Pattern Discovery**\n\n*   **Example 1**:  Initially, I see a mostly black grid with a large \"blob\" that has holes within it. I notice clusters of colored markers (2, 8, and 4 in different corners). The output grid is the same black and green structure but a path added that connects these holes.  The path uses the colors 2, 8 and 4. The path is a zig zag or stairs.\n    *   **Hints**:   The hints are key: The main shape stays the same. The marker colors and their placement define segments and turns. A separate marker is used at the \"bends\".\n    *   **Important Observation**: It looks like the markers INSIDE the blob tell us the colors of the lines of the path and the color of the turns in the path, but they are *removed* from the output.  The background color is usually preserved but the path is carved from the blob.\n*   **Example 2**:   Similar setup, but now there are two distinct start/end points, and a single marker outside the \"blob\". The output has multiple lines that are parallel to edges.\n    *   **Key**: Horizontal line. The single points on the edge draw horizontal lines to the boundary. Another marker causes a vertical line. I'm starting to think these lone markers are \"emitters\". They send out these lines. I think the geometry, or open space next to the wall will be important.\n    *   **Hint**: The multiple lines start to project from the markers to hit the blob and turn. Then a second line goes up.\n*   **Example 3**:  It seems like Example 3 gives me more specific color pattern. Here, the blob color is changed. Now, I see two paths are drawn.\n    *   **The Big Picture** I think the rule is clear. A color is projected. The singletons on the outer edges are special. I need to figure out how each color projects to cause the turns.\n    *   **Important**: In this one, It looks like the lines are actually created by erasing or modifying the underlying \"blob\" color, not just being drawn ON TOP of it.  I'm really starting to see the pattern. It also seems the \"7\" turn marker causes a stop.\n\n**Formulating the Algorithm**\n\n1.  **Color Identification**:   Determine the \"Background\", the \"Blob\", the \"Line Palette\" (colors that will be used in the path), and the \"Turn Color\".\n2.  **Path Construction**:\n    *   Starting Point: Find the lone markers on the edge of a blob, *if adjacent to the empty space.*\n    *   Line Creation: The path goes from a marked pixel in one of the colors that borders empty space, and the marker colors will define the segments that make up the line.\n    *   Coloring: Line alternates \"Line Palette\" colors.\n    *   Stop Condition: When the path hits the \"wall\" or edge.\n3.  **Turning Logic**: This is the heart of the challenge:\n    *   Hit a Wall: if the next spot in the direction we are going is occupied by the \"Blob\" color or by a wall of the grid\n    *   Check for open or occupied spots (left/right of the direction).\n    *   If there's an open spot: put the \"Turn Color\". Turn 90 degrees and continue\n    *   If both or none orthogonal directions are open: Stop at the Wall.\n\n**Test Case Application**\nApplying this to the example, it looks correct:\n\n1.  Identify color:  Blue \"empty\", Yellow blob, The Start marker pixel is at the edge. The line runs through the \"Blob\". Turn is \"8\".  There's no marker at the edge.\n\n**Key Insight:** Path can be in blob. Not the Background.\n\n**Applying Algorithm**\n\nNow, I think I have a solid algorithm.  The tricky part will be the implementation to ensure that all the color patterns are correct, and all the \"turn\" rules are applied correctly.  I'll need to double check the segment lengths match the original examples. The path is \"projected\" through the matrix. The blob and background colors can sometimes be reversed.\n\nTo solve this task, I will apply the logic derived from the examples:\n\n1.  **Identify Roles of Colors:**\n    *   **Background:** 9 (Maroon). This is the color filling the large empty channels where lines will be drawn.\n    *   **Blob:** 8 (Teal). This is the color of the walls/obstacles.\n    *   **Start Markers:** 3 (Green). Found as single pixels on the left boundary (`(14,0)` and `(26,0)`).\n    *   **Line Palette:** Found in the top-left cluster inside the blob. `3,3` and `6,6` inside the 8-region. The pattern is derived from the counts: `3,3` appears three times in the cluster (or implies a count), `6,6` appears once. Based on previous examples (like Ex 2 `4,4`, `1,1` -> `4,1`), the pattern uses one unit per instance type in the cluster? Actually, in Example 3, `2,2` (Red) appeared twice and `3,3` (Green) once in the cluster, and the pattern was `2,2,3`.\n    *   Let's check the cluster in the test input:\n        *   Row 1: `...3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6...`\n        *   There are three `3,3` pairs and one `6,6` pair.\n        *   So the pattern is **`3,3,3,6`** (Green, Green, Green, Magenta).\n    *   **Turn/End Marker:** Found in the bottom-right cluster. `7,7` (Orange). Single marker value is **7**.\n\n2.  **Path Logic:**\n    *   Paths start at the **Start Markers** on the boundary.\n    *   They extend straight in the direction away from the border (Right).\n    *   They traverse the **Background** (9).\n    *   **Coloring:** The path follows the repeating pattern `3,3,3,6`.\n    *   **Turning/Stopping:**\n        *   The line continues until it is about to hit a **Wall** (Blob color 8) or the grid edge.\n        *   The pixel immediately before the wall becomes a **Turn Marker** (color 7), replacing the pattern color at that position.\n        *   At a Turn Marker, the path turns 90 degrees towards an **Open** direction (Background 9).\n        *   If multiple directions are open, it turns to the one that continues the logical flow (often determined by walls).\n        *   If the path hits the grid edge, it places an End Marker (7) and stops.\n\n3.  **Trace Path 1:**\n    *   **Start:** `(14, 0)` (Green/3).\n    *   **Segment 1 (Right):** Move East from `(14, 0)`.\n        *   Wall detected at `(14, 7)` (Value 8).\n        *   Path goes to `(14, 6)`.\n        *   Pattern: `3,3,3,6`.\n        *   Pixels `(14,0)` to `(14,5)` are `3,3,3,6,3,3`.\n        *   Pixel `(14,6)` is the Turn. Replaces next pattern value (3) with **7**.\n        *   **Turn:** At `(14, 6)`, South is blocked (Row 15 is 8s), North is open. Turn **North**.\n    *   **Segment 2 (Up):** Move North from `(14, 6)`.\n        *   Wall detected at `(5, 6)` (Value 8).\n        *   Path goes to `(6, 6)`.\n        *   Pattern resumes from where it left off (index 3 -> 6).\n        *   Sequence: `6,3,3,3...`.\n        *   Pixel `(6, 6)` is the Turn. Replaces pattern value with **7**.\n        *   **Turn:** At `(6, 6)`, North is blocked. West `(6, 5)` and East `(6, 7)` are open. Looking at the overall structure, East leads to the other path's area, West wraps around. Let's trace West.\n    *   **Segment 3 (West):** Move West from `(6, 6)`.\n        *   Wall detected at `(6, 3)` (Value 8).\n        *   Path goes to `(6, 4)`.\n        *   Pixel `(6, 4)` is the Turn.

Turn **West**.\n    *   **Segment 7 (West):** Move West from `(6, 15)` to `(6, 6)`.\n        *   Connects to existing marker 7 at `(6, 6)`.\n\n4.  **Trace Path 2:**\n    *   **Start:** `(26, 0)` (Green/3).\n    *   **Segment 1 (Right):** Move East.\n        *   Wall detected at `(26, 11)` (Value 8).\n        *   Path goes to `(26, 10)`.\n        *   Pattern: `3,3,3,6...`.\n        *   Pixel `(26, 10)` is Turn.

This gives the repeating pattern: **3,3,3,6**\n\n3. **Endpoint Marker**: The 7,7 block at rows 25-26, cols 24-25 serves as the endpoint marker.\n\n4. **Row Markers**: Single 3s at (14,0) and (26,0) indicate where to draw horizontal lines.\n\n**Applying the Transformation:**\n\n1. **Row 14 horizontal line**: The blob (9s) at cols 1-6, so fill cols 0-6 with pattern 3,3,3,6,3,3,3, then endpoint 7 at col 7.\n\n2. **Column 6 vertical line**: The blob starts at row 6 in this column. Place endpoint 7 at row 5, then pattern 3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3 from rows 6-14.\n\n3. **Row 26 horizontal line**: The blob (9s) at cols 1-10, so fill cols 0-10 with pattern 3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3, then endpoint 7 at col 11.\n\n4. **Column 10 vertical line**: The blob resumes at row 18 after a gap. Place endpoint 7 at row 17, then pattern 3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3 from rows 18-26.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 23>\n</INPUT_DATA>\n\n<AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\nExecute this pipeline sequentially for every Candidate. You must output your thinking process inside <AUDIT_LOG> tags.\n\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\n- **Selection:** If a Candidate contains multiple <REASONING> blocks, read them all and select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation to audit.\n- **Crystallization:** Convert that text into a strict \"IF-THEN\" algorithm.\n  - *Bad:* \"The pattern involves moving blue pixels.\" (Too vague to audit)\n  - *Good:* \"IF a pixel is Blue, THEN move it 1 step Right. Else, preserve color.\"\n- *Constraint:* If the reasoning is incoherent or vague, mark the Candidate as \"INVALID - VAGUE\".\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT (CRITICAL)\n- You must \"Back-Test\" the Crystallized Rule against the {{SOLVED_EXAMPLES}}.\n- For **EACH** Solved Example pair (Input -> Output), you must strictly perform this 3-step check:\n  1. **Hypothesis:** \"If I apply the Candidate's Rule to this Input, exactly what *should* happen?\"\n  2. **Observation:** \"Look at the actual Official Output. What *actually* happened?\"\n  3. **Verdict:** \"Do they match?\"\n- **Fatal Contradictions to Watch For:**\n  * **Scope Error:** Rule applies to specific colors (e.g., \"Blue\"), but the example changes \"Red\" pixels.\n  * **Geometry Error:** Rule says \"rotate 90,\" but example shows a flip.\n  * **Object Error:** Rule treats pixels individually, but example shows objects moving as blocks.\n- *Constraint:* Record exactly how many Solved Examples the candidate PASSED vs FAILED. **Do not stop at the first failure**; check all examples to determine the severity of the failure (e.g., \"Passed 2/3 Examples\").\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n- For Candidates that survived Phase 2 (or passed at least one example):\n- Look at the {{TEST_INPUT}} and the Candidate's <PROPOSED_SOLUTION> grid.\n- Does the proposed output actually follow the Crystallized Rule?\n- *Common Hallucination:* The text says \"Move Blue,\" but the grid shows Blue staying still.

task. They want me to decode a pattern-recognition puzzle based on a few examples, and I'm ready for the challenge. My initial instinct is to break down the task into smaller, more manageable parts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's in play. In this case, I'm working with a set of image grids. I have an input, and the goal is to predict the corresponding output. The inputs and outputs seem to have a fixed size, in this case, 20x20. I observe that the input grids are made up of regions with distinct background colors. These backgrounds define a 'TL region' and a 'BR region.'\n\n**Here's the approach I take, step by step:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Example:** I start by examining the provided examples, especially Example 1, to identify the main patterns and their relationships. I'm looking for clues about the underlying transformation the problem is imposing.\n2.  **Define the Structure:** It becomes clear that the image grids have distinct objects placed against a background. My goal is to extract those objects and understand how they interact.\n3.  **Pattern Decomposition:** I identify two key patterns: one in the top-left region and the other in the bottom-right region.\n4.  **Transformation Analysis:** I note that these regions have background colors and specific patterns. I suspect the output is a result of some pattern overlay process.\n5.  **Shifting Hypothesis:** In the analysis, I considered that the output could be created through a combination of the two patterns, where one might be moved (\"shifted\" or \"translated\") relative to the other.\n6.  **Deconstructing the Pattern:** I need to look for repeating units within the pattern, i.e., \"periodic structure.\" I need to find the \"period,\" the size of the unit that makes a repeated structure.\n7.  **Identify the Underlying Principle:** I need to build a logical rule that links an input to its output. It could involve shifting the pattern, combining the two, or some other transformation that applies consistently across examples.\n\n**In the Analysis:**\n\n*   I check for periodicity, e.g., if there are patterns.\n*   The \"diagonal\" pattern is interesting. I'll need to see if it's the boundary between two repeating patterns.\n*   I look at the background and try to infer the rules.\n*   I considered a lot of possibilities: rotation, scaling, shifting.\n*   Based on example, I decided that an overlap operation is likely. I'll need to figure out the overlap rule, so my analysis will include looking at where the inputs and outputs overlap.\n*   It looks like the key is how the patterns are laid out.\n*   So I need to encode the input structure.\n\nAfter much trial and error, I believe I can solve this. The steps are:\n\n1.  **Extract the pattern**: from each of the two regions.\n2.  **Apply translation**: The translation is the main parameter here. I assume it's like a sliding operation and the translation is some kind of a vector.\n3.  **Combine the two**: The key rule here is that the BR \"pattern\" overwrites the TL \"pattern\".\n\nThis approach will help me understand this problem and construct an efficient solution.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we analyze the transformation rules based on the provided examples, specifically identifying the two distinct patterns (Top-Left and Bottom-Right) and their propagation across the grid.\n\n**1. Analysis of Patterns and Backgrounds:**\n*   **Backgrounds:** The grid is divided into two regions by a diagonal boundary.\n    *   Top-Left (TL) Region: Background color 8 (Teal).\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR) Region: Background color 9 (Maroon).\n    *   The output preserves these background regions, except where patterns overlay them.\n*   **TL Pattern (from Input):**\n    *   Located in the TL region (rows 1 and 2).\n    *   Row sequence: `8 3 3 8 3 3 8 3 3 8 6 6` repeating.\n    *   Objects: Green (3) and Magenta (6). The Teal (8) is background/transparent.\n    *   Vertical Structure: The pattern appears on 2 consecutive rows, followed by 1 empty row (containing only background). This implies a vertical period of 3 rows.\n    *   Propagation Vector: Based on Example 1, the TL pattern shifts horizontally by 12 positions for every vertical period (3 rows).\n        *   Rows $1, 4, 7, 10, ...$ use the pattern shifted by $0, 12, 24, 6, ...$ respectively.\n        *   Rows $2, 5, 8, 11, ...$ use the pattern shifted by $0, 12, 24, 6, ...$ respectively.\n*   **BR Pattern (from Input):**\n    *   Located in the BR region (rows 25 and 26).\n    *   Objects: A 2x2 block of Orange (7) pixels.\n    *   Propagation Vector: Based on Example 1, the BR objects move with a vector of $(+4, +1)$ (4 rows down, 1 column right).\n    *   The BR pattern overwrites the TL pattern and backgrounds where they collide.\n\n**2. Construction of the Output Grid:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Initialize Background.**\n    Copy the input grid's background structure (the 8s and 9s).\n\n*   **Step 2: Apply TL Pattern.**\n    For rows $r$ where $r \\pmod 3 \\neq 0$ (i.e., rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8...):\n    *   Calculate the shift factor $k = \\lfloor r / 3 \\rfloor$.\n    *   Horizontal shift $s = (12 \\times k) \\pmod{30}$.\n    *   Construct the row pattern by repeating `8 3 3 8 3 3 8 3 3 8 6 6` to fill width 30.\n    *   Shift this pattern right by $s$.\n    *   Overlay the non-background pixels (3 and 6) onto the grid at row $r$.\n\n*   **Step 3: Apply BR Pattern.**\n    *   Identify the source block of 7s at $(25, 24)$.

I see a 30x30 grid with a diagonal split.  The colors are 8 (Azure) and 9 (Maroon), and it looks like it\u2019s divided into a region of 8s (Top-Left) and a region of 9s (Bottom-Right), but not perfectly diagonal.  There are these patterns of `3,3` (Green) and `6,6` (Magenta) in the 8 region and a sort of island of 8s in the 9 region with some `7,7` (Orange) inside.  My initial thought is that there are these two separate textures: the Azure texture, and the Maroon texture, defined over the whole grid.\n\nI see that the pattern in the Azure (8) part is `8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,8,8`.  And the 9 part (Maroon) has a smaller shape of 8 that overlaps it at the bottom. The core concept here seems to be about transferring the shape, as with the prior examples, the shapes of the two primary regions (8 and 9) change.\n\nIt feels like there's a geometric transformation and a texture swap going on. Basically: if a part of Region 8 \"goes into\" Region 9, the same shape in Region 9 needs to \"go into\" Region 8 in the output. And I'm starting to think the 8-region, which is the main part of the Top, and a bit of the bottom, gets transferred (flipped) into the 9-region. And `7,7` is a decoration, a small thing on the larger shape, so the decorations, in effect, are moved together with the shape.\n\nThe bottom (9s and the partial 8) gets flipped and now sits on the top, with pattern: `9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9`, and the decoration `7,7` is placed in this newly flipped area. The top (8s) is now mostly clean, with the decoration `7,7`, moved into its area. The goal of this task is to make this work, for any input with the given constraints and parameters, which should make the process much more scalable.\n\n\nThe solution involves identifying two regions in the grid (Background A and Background B), extracting the texture/pattern from the primary region, and applying a specific transformation that involves swapping textures and reflecting \"island\" features.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Regions:** The grid is divided into two regions by a diagonal boundary.\n    *   **Region A (Top-Left/Right):** Background color 8 (Azure). This region contains a repeating pattern of decorations: `3,3` (Green) and `6,6` (Magenta).\n    *   **Region B (Bottom-Left):** Background color 9 (Maroon). In the input, this region is mostly solid 9s, but contains an \"Island\" of 8s extending into it.\n\n2.  **Analyze Patterns:**\n    *   **Texture A ($P_F$):** Derived from Region A. It is a repeating row pattern on the background of 8: `8, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8...`.\n    *   **Island Decoration ($D_I$):** The input has a unique feature `7,7` (Orange) located in the bottom-right part of the grid (within the extension of region 8).\n\n3.  **Transformation Rules:**\n    *   **Background Fill:** The output preserves the background regions (Region A remains 8, Region B remains 9).\n    *   **Texture Swap:**\n        *   Region A (Background 8) is cleared of its original texture (becomes \"Clean 8\").\n        *   Region B (Background 9) is filled with Texture A. We map the pattern `3,3...6,6` onto the 9-background. The pattern row becomes `9, 3, 3, 9, 3, 3, 9, 3, 3, 9, 6, 6, 9, 9...`.\n    *   **Feature Reflection:**\n        *   The \"Island\" feature (an intrusion of one region into the other) is reflected vertically.\n        *   The decorations from the bottom part of the grid (`7,7`) are moved to the top part via vertical reflection ($row \\to 29 - row$).\n        *   Input `7,7` is at Rows 25-26. Output `7,7` moves to Rows 3-4.\n        *   The \"Hole\" logic: In the solved examples, an island of Color A inside Region B in the input becomes an island of Color B inside Region A in the output. Here, we create a block of 9s (with texture) inside Region A, corresponding to the reflected position of the 8-block from the input. However, given the complexity, the primary visible change is the movement of the unique decoration `7,7` and the filling of Region 9 with the pattern.\n\n4.  **Construction:**\n    *   Create a grid with the same background split as the input (8s and 9s).\n    *   **Region 8 (Top):** Clear all `3`s and `6`s. Place `7,7` at the reflected top position (Rows 3-4, Cols 24-25).\n    *   **Region 9 (Bottom):** Fill every row in this region with the pattern `9, 3, 3, 9, 3, 3, 9, 3, 3, 9, 6, 6, 9, 9...`.\n    *   **Island Swap:** Create a rectangular region of 9s in the top half (reflected from the bottom 8-block) and fill it with the pattern. The bottom 8-block is effectively replaced by the pattern fill of Region 9.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\nRow 0-12 (Region 8): Solid 8, except for the reflected `7,7` and the new island of 9s (patterned).\nRow 13-29 (Region 9 + 8): The area that was 9 is filled with the pattern. The area that was 8 is cleared (or filled if it was the island source).\n\nFinal check on `7,7` position: Input Row 25 is 4 from bottom. Output Row 4 is 4 from top.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,9,9\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,3,9,3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,3,3,9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,6,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,3,3,9,3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n

area, there's a pattern made of 2x2 colored blocks (test: 3,3,3,6 from the blocks at rows 1-2)\n2. **Markers**: Single colored pixels indicating where horizontal lines start (test: 3 at (14,0) and (26,0))\n3. **Destination Block**: A 2x2 block of another color (test: 7,7 at rows 25-26, cols 24-25)\n4. **Secondary Region**: A different colored region (test: 9s) separating the pattern area from destination\n\nThe transformation:\n- Clears the pattern definition and destination blocks to background color\n- Draws horizontal lines from markers through the secondary region using the repeating pattern\n- Draws vertical/diagonal lines along the boundary between regions using the pattern\n- Places destination color (7) at intersection points and boundaries\n\nThe pattern 3,3,3,6 repeats with period 4, aligned by column position.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7\n3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,8\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n

  <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find the two \u201cbase\u201d colors** (the ones forming almost the entire picture).  \n   The **background** is the color in the **top-left cell**. The other base color is the **region color** (the \u201cfilled\u201d area we will draw through).\n\n2. **Read the repeating pattern from the top-left 2\u00d72 blocks**:  \n   Near the top-left there is a horizontal row of **2\u00d72 monochrome blocks** made of non-base colors.  \n   Record their colors **left\u2192right**; this ordered list is the **pattern cycle** (it may include repeats).\n\n3. **Find the \u201cmarker color\u201d**:  \n   There is one other **2\u00d72 monochrome block** (not part of the top-left row). Its color is the **marker**.\n\n4. **Erase the source blocks**:  \n   Replace all cells of the top-left pattern blocks **and** the marker block with the **background color**.\n\n5. **Trace staircase path(s) from left-edge start pixels**:  \n   On the **left edge** there are one or more single pixels in the **first pattern color**. Each is a start point.\n   \n   For each start point, trace a path through the **region color** by alternating:\n   - Go **right** as long as the next cell is region color.\n     - After the run, set the cell **immediately to the right** (if inside the grid) to the **marker color**.\n   - From the last region cell, go **up** as long as the cell above is region color.\n     - After the run, set the cell **immediately above** (if inside the grid) to the **marker color**.\n   - Repeat until a right-run cannot be followed by an up-run, or the right-run reaches the grid edge.\n\n6. **Color the path cells with the repeating pattern**:  \n   Walk the path in the order traced (start \u2192 right \u2192 up \u2192 right \u2192 \u2026) and paint those visited cells with the pattern cycle, looping as needed, starting from the first pattern element at the start pixel.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n- Background (top-left) = **8**\n- Region color = **9**\n- Top-left 2\u00d72 blocks (left\u2192right) give pattern = **[3, 3, 3, 6]**\n- Marker 2\u00d72 block color = **7** (the 7,7 square)\n- Start pixels on left edge: at **row 15 col 1** and **row 27 col 1** (both are 3)\n\nPaths traced:\n- From (15,1): right to col7, up to row7, right to col24; markers at (15,8), (6,7), (7,25)\n- From (27,1): right to col11, up to row19, right to col27, up to row8, right to col30; markers at (27,12), (18,11), (19,28), (7,27)\n\nThen paint each path with repeating [3,3,3,6], and erase the source 2\u00d72 blocks.\n\n---\n\n### Output

transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nEach puzzle has three important ingredients:\n\n1. **A \u201cpattern key\u201d in the top-left**: several *2\u00d72 solid-color blocks* sitting in the background color, separated by background cells.  \n   - Read the colors of these blocks **left-to-right** to get a repeating sequence `P`.\n   - In the examples this produced sequences like `[2,2,8]`, `[4,1]`, `[2,2,3]`.\n\n2. **A separate 2\u00d72 solid-color block elsewhere** (not part of the key): its color is a special **marker color** `M`.  \n   - This block is **removed** in the output (repainted as surrounding background), but its color `M` is used as \u201cend caps\u201d on the drawn path.\n\n3. **One or more single cells on the left edge** having the first color of `P`: these are **start markers**.\n\n---\n\n### What the output does\n\n1. **Erase**:\n   - Replace every cell of the top-left key blocks with the surrounding background color.\n   - Replace every cell of the separate 2\u00d72 marker block with its surrounding background color.\n\n2. **For each left-edge start marker**:\n   - Let `F` be the color immediately to its right (this is the \u201cfill\u201d color the path travels through).\n   - Starting at the marker, draw a monotone \u201csnake\u201d path through cells of color `F` by repeating:\n     - go **as far right as possible** through `F`\n     - then go **as far up as possible** through `F`\n     - then right again, then up again, \u2026\n   - Paint every visited path cell with the repeating sequence `P`, advancing one step in `P` per move (the sequence **continues through turns**, it does not restart).\n   - Whenever a right/up run stops because the next cell is *not* `F` (and is inside the grid), paint that blocking cell with the marker color `M`.\n   - Stop if you hit the grid boundary in the movement direction, or if after turning you cannot move even one cell.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n- Top-left 2\u00d72 blocks give the pattern sequence: **`P = [3,3,3,6]`**.\n- The separate 2\u00d72 block is color **7**, so **`M = 7`** (and that original 7-block is erased).\n- The left-edge start markers are the **3** at row 15 col 1 and row 27 col 1.\n- The fill color to their right is **9**, so `F = 9`.\n\nFollowing the right/up snake rule from each start produces the output below.\n\n---\n\n### Output

transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Identify the two main region colors**\n   - The **background color** is the color in the top-left cell `(0,0)`.\n   - The **fill-region color** is the other dominant color forming the large mass (the \u201cmaze\u201d the path runs through).\n\n2. **Extract the repeating pattern**\n   - In the top-left, there are several **2\u00d72 monochrome blocks** (all the same color per block) arranged left-to-right.\n   - Read these block colors **left \u2192 right** to get an ordered list `P` (duplicates are kept).  \n     This list is the **repeating pattern** used to color the path.\n\n3. **Find the marker color**\n   - Elsewhere there is a **2\u00d72 monochrome block** of a different \u201cspecial\u201d color.  \n   - Its color `M` is used as the **marker** placed just outside path segments.\n\n4. **Erase the palette + marker blocks**\n   - The palette 2\u00d72 blocks and the marker 2\u00d72 block are removed by repainting them with the **background color**.\n\n5. **Find starting seeds**\n   - Any cell on the **left border** whose color equals `P[0]` is a **start seed**.\n\n6. **Draw a staircase path for each seed (pattern index resets per seed)**\n   - Start at the seed with pattern index `i=0`.\n   - Repeatedly:\n     1. **Go right** through the contiguous run of the fill-region color, starting from the current position (including the current cell), coloring each step with `P[i]`, advancing `i` each move.\n        - At the run\u2019s end, if there is a cell immediately to the right (inside grid), color it with marker `M`.\n        - If the run ends at the **right edge**, stop this seed\u2019s path.\n     2. **Go up** through the contiguous run of the fill-region color in that ending column, coloring each step continuing the same advancing pattern index.\n        - If the cell above the top of the run exists, color it with marker `M`.\n        - If you cannot move up at all, or you reach the **top edge**, stop this seed\u2019s path.\n     3. Continue from the top cell and repeat.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n- Background color = **8**\n- Fill-region color = **9**\n- Palette 2\u00d72 blocks (top-left) give pattern: **`P = [3,3,3,6]`**\n- Marker 2\u00d72 block color: **`M = 7`**\n- Seeds on left edge with color `3`: at rows **14** and **26**\n\nPaths traced:\n- From seed `(14,0)`: right to col 6 \u2192 up to row 6 \u2192 right to col 23 (then stops).\n- From seed `(26,0)`: right to col 10 \u2192 up to row 18 \u2192 right to col 26 \u2192 up to row 7 \u2192 right to col 29 (then stops).\nMarkers `7` are placed immediately after each horizontal segment and immediately above each vertical segment.\n\n---\n\n## Output

Extract the repeating pattern\nIn the top-left area (rows 1\u20132) there are four solid **2\u00d72** blocks, read left-to-right:\n\n- block at cols **1\u20132** is color **3**\n- block at cols **4\u20135** is color **3**\n- block at cols **7\u20138** is color **3**\n- block at cols **10\u201311** is color **6**\n\nSo the repeating pattern is:\n\n\\[\n[3,\\;3,\\;3,\\;6]\n\\]\n\n### 2) Erase the pattern template blocks\nThose 2\u00d72 blocks sit in an **8** background, so they are repainted to **8** (removed from the output).\n\n### 3) Find the terminal-marker color and erase its block\nThere is a separate solid **2\u00d72** block of **7** at rows **25\u201326**, cols **24\u201325**.  \nSo the terminal-marker color is **7**, and that 2\u00d72 block is erased to its surrounding background (**8**).\n\n### 4) Locate start pixels and traverse each track\nThe first pattern color is **3**. The grid contains two isolated single **3** start pixels (not part of the erased templates):\n\n- Start A: **(row 14, col 0)**\n- Start B: **(row 26, col 0)**\n\nFor each start:\n- The track color is the color immediately to the right: **9**.\n- Traverse in a staircase: **maximal right run**, then **maximal up run**, repeating.\n- Recolor the visited track cells sequentially with the repeating pattern \\([3,3,3,6]\\) (continuing through turns).\n- At the end of each run, recolor the blocking cell (right of a right-run, above an up-run) to **7**.\n\nRuns found:\n\n**Start A (14,0):**\n- Right to (14,6), mark (14,7)=7\n- Up to (6,6), mark (5,6)=7\n- Right to (6,23), mark (6,24)=7\n\n**Start B (26,0):**\n- Right to (26,10), mark (26,11)=7\n- Up to (18,10), mark (17,10)=7\n- Right to (18,26), mark (18,27)=7\n- Up to (7,26), mark (6,26)=7\n- Right to (7,29) (edge; stop)\n\n---\n\n## Output

changes and what stays the same\nIn every training example there are three \u201clayers\u201d:\n\n1. **The main 2\u2011color scene** (background + one huge blob) stays as the base image.\n2. **A small top\u2011left \u201cpalette\u201d cluster** provides the repeating colors used to draw thin 1\u2011cell wide orthogonal lines.\n3. **A separate marker color** (a small block elsewhere, here in the lower\u2011right) is *not kept*; instead its color is reused to mark exits/ends of the constructed line (at turns/endpoints where the line leaves the blob into the background).\n\nThe \u201cinstruction\u201d pixels (singletons) are not preserved as single pixels; they become the starting points of the drawn line.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Identify the roles of colors in the test input\n\n#### Main 2\u2011color scene\nAlmost everything is **8** and **9**.  \nThe top\u2011left palette cluster sits inside an **8** area, so:\n\n- **Background = 8**\n- **Blob to draw through = 9**\n\n#### Palette (line pattern) colors\nThe top\u2011left cluster (rows 2\u20133) contains four separate little blocks when read left\u2192right:\n- three blocks of **3**\n- one block of **6**\n\nSo the repeating line pattern is the cyclic sequence:\n\n**[3, 3, 3, 6]** repeated along the path.\n\n(That\u2019s why some examples have patterns like 2,2,8 repeating: the first color appears in multiple blocks.)\n\n#### Junction/endpoint marker color\nThe only other \u201cforeign\u201d color block is **7** (a 2\u00d72 in the lower\u2011right area).  \nThat block is removed, and **7** is used to mark the **first background cell right after a line segment leaves the 9\u2011blob**.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Find the start markers (instruction single pixels)\nThere are two isolated **3** pixels on the left edge:\n- (row 15, col 1)\n- (row 27, col 1)\n\nEach has a **9** immediately to the right, so each starts a line.\n\n---\n\n### 3) How the line is constructed (the \u201cstaircase\u201d rule)\n\nFor each start marker:\n\n1. **Go right** through consecutive **9** cells.\n   - Color the visited cells (including the start marker) with the repeating palette sequence **[3,3,3,6]**, continuing step-by-step.\n   - When the next cell is **8** (background), color that first **8** cell with **7**.\n2. From the last 9-cell you colored, **try to go up**:\n   - Only if the cell above is still **9**.\n   - Color upward through the 9s continuing the same cyclic palette sequence.\n   - When you exit into **8**, mark that exit cell with **7**.\n3. Alternate **right, up, right, up\u2026** until the next segment cannot start (above isn\u2019t 9) or you hit the grid border.\n\nAlso: the original palette blocks (3/6) and the original 7-block are reset back to background **8**.\n\nApplied here, this produces:\n- From row 15 col 1: right to col 7, up to row 7, right to col 24.\n- From row 27 col 1: right to col 11, up to row 19, right to col 27, up to row 8, right to the border.\n\n---\n\n## Output

Inferred rule (from the solved examples)\n\nEach input contains (ignoring the tiny \u201cmarker\u201d colors) a **2\u2011color scene**:\n- **background** = the most common color\n- **largest blob** = the other main color (a single big connected region)\n\nThe extra colors are *not part of the final picture*; they are instructions for drawing thin orthogonal lines.\n\n#### 1) Read the \u201cpalette\u201d (repeating line colors)\nIn the **top-left** there is a small horizontal cluster of **2\u00d72 blocks** of non-scene colors.  \nRead the block colors **left \u2192 right**; keep duplicates.  \nThis produces a cyclic sequence used to color the line, one cell per step.\n\nExamples:\n- blocks `2,2,8` \u21d2 repeat `2,2,8,2,2,8,...`\n- blocks `4,1` \u21d2 repeat `4,1,4,1,...`\n\n**Test:** the top-left blocks are `3,3,3,6` \u21d2 palette cycle = **[3,3,3,6]**.\n\n#### 2) Find the \u201cturn/junction\u201d color\nA separate small block (in the lower-right area) uses one extra color; that color is used to mark:\n- the **blob cell that blocks movement** at every turn / endpoint against the blob.\n\n**Test:** that color is **7**.\n\n#### 3) Restore the 2-color scene\nReplace the palette blocks and the special block back to their underlying scene color (here: blob color), so the base image is only background+blob again.\n\n#### 4) Use single-pixel markers as start points and draw \u201cstaircase\u201d paths\nThere are isolated single pixels of the **first palette color** placed in the background; each one starts a path.\n\nFor each start marker:\n- start direction = **East**\n- then alternate **East, North, East, North, ...**\n- in each direction, move step-by-step through **background** cells only, coloring each visited background cell with the next palette color (continue the cycle across turns)\n- when the next cell in that direction is **blob**, paint that blocking blob cell with the **special color**, then turn (switch direction)\n- if after turning you cannot move even one background cell, stop\n- if you hit the grid border, stop (no special color for the border)\n\n**Test:** start markers are the two single `3` pixels at row 15 col 1 and row 27 col 1.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8

ingredients:\n\n1. **Background color `B`**  \n   The color that fills the top-left area (and surrounds the small \u201clegend\u201d blocks).  \n   - Ex1: `B=3`, Ex2: `B=2`, Ex3: `B=1`  \n   In the test, the top-left is all `8`, so **`B=8`**.\n\n2. **Palette sequence `S` (a repeating 1D pattern)**  \n   Near the top-left there are several **2\u00d72 solid blocks** of colors different from `B`.  \n   Read these blocks **left-to-right** to get a sequence (duplicates kept).  \n   - Ex1: blocks `2,2,8`  \u2192 `S=[2,2,8]`  \n   - Ex2: blocks `4,1`    \u2192 `S=[4,1]`  \n   - Ex3: blocks `2,2,3`  \u2192 `S=[2,2,3]`\n\n3. **Marker color `M`**  \n   There is also a separate **2\u00d72 solid block** elsewhere with another color; that color is used as a \u201cstop marker\u201d at turns.  \n   (That 2\u00d72 block is erased back to the background in the output.)\n\n**Main action: draw an up-right \u201cstaircase path\u201d through the main region**, recoloring visited cells by cycling through `S`, and putting marker `M` where the path hits a boundary.\n\n- A **seed** is a cell on the **left edge** whose color equals `S[0]`.  \n- From each seed, define the \u201cwalk color\u201d `C` as the color immediately to its right (cell `(r,2)`).  \n- Walk starting at the seed:\n  - Start direction = **right**.\n  - Move step-by-step through cells of color `C` (in the current direction), recoloring each visited cell with the next element of `S` (cycling).\n  - When the next cell in the current direction is **inside the grid but not color `C`**, color that blocking cell with `M`, then turn (right\u2194up).\n  - If after turning you cannot even take the first step (the adjacent cell is not `C`), stop that seed\u2019s walk.\n  - If you hit the grid edge, you just turn (no marker placed outside the grid).\n\nFinally:\n- The small palette 2\u00d72 blocks are **erased back to background `B`**.\n- The marker 2\u00d72 block is **erased back to background `B`**.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n- Background `B = 8`.\n- Palette blocks in rows 2\u20133 give: `3, 3, 3, 6` \u2192 **`S=[3,3,3,6]`**.\n- The separate 2\u00d72 block is color `7` \u2192 **marker `M=7`** (and that

  <EXPLANATION>\n**Test Input Analysis and Algorithm Derivation**\n\nAs a seasoned expert, I've approached this ARC task with a focus on pattern recognition and geometric transformations. My process involves analyzing the examples and looking for consistent structures that allow me to predict the output.\n\nInitial observations suggested an image that was \"cut\" and partially obscured with a specific background colour to be inferred.\nI started by analyzing the first example and noticing the two \"objects\" which had a similar background color (3) and features (2 and 8, or 4), separated by a region of zeros. The output showed these two objects \"collided\" or \"merged\" after removing the gap in the input. In the second example the background was split into regions 2 and 8. The shapes inside each regions of were still preserved but \"collided\" in such a way.  It was clear that the structure of the examples involved some sort of  transform.\n\nI considered transformations such as rotation, translation, or mirroring. However, the examples had objects overlapping, but not colliding in the usual sense.\n\nBy analyzing the example input grids and output images, I realized that the transformations in each example had some recurring patterns. I tried to figure out a \"re-assembling\" method with all examples by analyzing and figuring out the features within the images.\n\nThe Test Input is a 30x30 image with two background colors (8 and 9) and features (3, 6, 7). The initial view had me see some diagonal bands that were key for the problem.\n\nBased on insights from the examples, a specific pattern \"8,3,3\" was established along the top, and a new structure appeared at the bottom (\"7,7\" on an 8 background). This setup was very similar to the first example with \"3,2,2\" on an empty background.\nThe second, third, and fourth examples showed a more detailed and clearer picture of the re-assembly logic, and it was clear that a \"pattern completion\" operation was necessary.\nA 30 x 30 grid means a symmetric split.\nThe rows are swapped such as the top rows fill the bottom and bottom rows fill the top.\nThe original \"9\" regions in the Test Input are re-assigned to the background colour \"8\".\nI focused my attention on the test input, which was a 30 x 30 grid with specific patterns. The two backgrounds were separated by a large band (the 9s). It became clear that the objective was to \"un-scramble\" the input to form a more complete image.\nI realized that if I swapped the top and bottom halves of the image (rows 0-14 with 15-29), the patterns would merge.\nFurther, as the regions with the background 9 were empty, the task was to fill the new regions with a specific colour to remove \"gaps\".\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  **Swap:** Divide the grid into two halves. Move top (rows 0-14) to bottom (rows 15-29), and bottom (rows 15-29) to top (rows 0-14).\n2.  **Color Replacement:** Replace all pixels with the value '9' with the value '8'.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1**: The input contains two distinct \"objects\" or \"fragments\" on a background of 3 (green) and 0 (black). The objects are in the top-left and bottom-right quadrants. The transformation effectively **swaps the top and bottom halves** of the grid (shifting by half the grid height). The background 0s (\"void\") are mostly filled in with the dominant background color (3), and the features from the top-left (2s, 8s) move to the bottom-left, while features from the bottom-right (4s) move to the top-right.\n2.  **Example 2**: The input shows a continuous pattern split by a diagonal boundary between background 2 and background 8. The output reconstructs a single consistent texture/pattern. The logic aligns with a toroidal shift or a rearrangement of the grid to merge the fragments.\n3.  **General Pattern**: The tasks involve identifying \"void\" or \"occluded\" regions and \"active\" regions, and then rearranging the active regions (often by swapping halves or shifting) to form a complete, coherent image. The \"void\" color is replaced by the main background color.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n-   **Grid Size**: 30x30.\n-   **Structure**:\n    -   **Top Half (Rows 0-14)**: Contains an object with features 3 (green) and 6 (magenta) on a background of 8 (azure). The top-right corner is filled with 9s (maroon).\n    -   **Bottom Half (Rows 15-29)**: Contains an object with feature 7 (orange) on a background of 8. The bottom-left corner is filled with 9s.\n-   **Interpretation**: The 8s represent the valid background with objects. The 9s represent the \"void\" or \"gap\" (analogous to 0s in Example 1). The valid parts are in the Top-Left and Bottom-Right.\n-   **Transformation**:\n    1.  **Swap Halves**: Move the Top Half (Rows 0-14) to the bottom (Rows 15-29) and the Bottom Half (Rows 15-29) to the top (Rows 0-14). This moves the Top-Left object to the Bottom-Left and the Bottom-Right object to the Top-Right, filling the voids.\n    2.  **Fill Void**: Replace all instances of the void color (9) with the active background color (8).\n\n**Step-by-Step Construction:**\n1.  **Output Rows 0-14**: Take Input Rows 15-29.

My main goal is to figure out how the different colored regions relate to each other in the given examples and then apply the logic to the test case. The core idea is that the provided input is just a partial view of a larger, repeating pattern, and the goal is to \"complete\" the image by extrapolating the underlying periodicity.\n\nHere's how I'm approaching it:\n\n1.  **Identify the Background and Foreground**: First, I'll need to figure out what color represents the \"gap\" or \"missing data\" (background), and what color(s) represent the actual image (foreground).\n\n2.  **Look for Periodic Structures**: The core of this problem is to find a repeating unit or shift vector. I'm going to look at the decorations and pixel arrangements, and how they repeat. The examples show patterns that are shifted, but might not be an exact direct copy. They are shifted relative to some \"cut\" or \"gap\".\n\n3.  **Find the Shift Vector**: Now it's time to actually find how to apply the discovered periodicity. I will be looking for a shift vector `(dy, dx)` (vertical and horizontal shift) that relates the disconnected image pieces. For example, by matching points in the foreground across the gap, or by identifying how the gaps, or boundaries, are positioned. I will test these shift vectors, to ensure they don't break the pattern.\n\n4.  **Fill the Gaps**:  Then, the actual algorithm to apply. I will use the identified shift vector(s) to \"fill\" the gaps or missing sections by copying pixels from the existing regions to the empty ones. Specifically, the strategy is this: for every gap pixel, find a valid source pixel from the input using the shift. We are trying to preserve the input \"decorations\" and \"background.\"  Priority is: Decoration > 8 > Gap. We can get these through two shifts:\n\n    1.  `(y, x) -> (y+13, x-4)` (BR)\n    2.  `(y, x) -> (y-13, x+4)` (TL)\n\nI'm focusing on preserving the foreground decorations as they are present in the provided input, and will only consider the background/gap pixels as the \"thing to fill\".\n\n5.  **Output**: Finally, I output the complete grid by filling the gaps following this process!\n\n\nBased on the solved examples, the task is to reconstruct a periodic image from a grid that contains two disjoint fragments separated by a \"gap\" (represented by a specific background color, here 9). The reconstruction involves finding the translational symmetry (shift vector) that aligns the two fragments and filling the gap with the pattern extended from the visible regions.\n\n**Analysis of the Test Input:**\n- **Grid Size:** 30x30.\n- **Background/Gap Color:** 9 (Maroon).\n- **Foreground Color:** 8 (Azure).\n- **Decorations:**\n  - Top-Left (TL) region (Rows 1-2) contains sequences of 3s (Green) and 6s (Magenta).\n    - Pattern: `3,3` at cols 1-2, 4-5, 7-8; `6,6` at cols 10-11.\n  - Bottom-Right (BR) region (Rows 25-26) contains 7s (Orange).\n    - Pattern: `7,7` at cols 24-25.\n  - There are isolated 3s at R14 C0 and R26 C0.\n\n**Step-by-Step Derivation:**\n1.  **Identify Shift Vector:**\n    By comparing the positions of the 3s in the TL region `(1, 4)` and the 3 at `(14, 0)`, we can deduce a shift vector `v = (13, -4)`.\n    - `(1, 4) + (13, -4) = (14, 0)`. Matches input.\n    - Let's verify with other points.\n    - If we apply `v` to the TL decorations, they fall into the gap of the middle region (Rows 14-15).\n    - If we apply `-v` (inverse shift) to the BR decorations, they fall into the gap of the middle/upper region (Rows 12-13).\n\n2.  **Fill the Gap (Rows 12-15):**\n    - **Propagate TL Decorations (`v = +13, -4`):**\n      - `3,3` at `(1,1)-(1,2)` -> `(14,27)-(14,28)`.\n      - `3,3` at `(1,4)-(1,5)` -> `(14,0)-(14,1)`. (Note: `(14,0)` is already 3).\n      - `3,3` at `(1,7)-(1,8)` -> `(14,3)-(14,4)`.\n      - `6,6` at `(1,10)-(1,11)` -> `(14,6)-(14,7)`.\n      - Repeat for Row 2 -> Row 15.\n    - **Propagate BR Decorations (`v = -13, +4`):**\n      - `7,7` at `(25,24)-(25,25)` -> `(12,28)-(12,29)`.\n      - `7,7` at `(26,24)-(26,25)` -> `(13,28)-(13,29)`.\n      - `3` at `(26,0)` -> `(13,4)`.\n\n3.  **Fill Remaining Gaps:**\n    - `R27 C0`: Propagate from `R14 C4` (which is filled with 3). `(14,4) + (13,-4) = (27,0)`. So `R27 C0` becomes 3.\n    - All other pixels with value 9 are filled with the foreground color 8.\n\n**Constructed Output Details:**\n- **Rows 0-11:** 9s become 8s. TL decorations remain.\n- **Row 12:** C28,29 become 7. Rest of 9s become 8.\n- **Row 13:** C4 becomes 3. C28,29 become 7. Rest of 9s become 8.\n- **Row 14:** C1 becomes 3; C3,4 become 3; C6,7 become 6; C27,28 become 3. Rest of 9s become 8.\n- **Row 15:** Same pattern as R14.\n- **Rows 16-24:** 9s become 8s.\n- **Row 25:** 9s become 8s.\n- **Row 26:** 9s become 8s.\n- **Row 27:** C0 becomes 3. Rest of 9s become 8.\n- **Rows 28-29:** 9s become

model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the following transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Template Pattern**: In the top-left corner, there's a template of 2x2 blocks defining a repeating pattern.\n2. **Markers**: Single colored cells (same color as first template block) appear elsewhere in the grid.\n3. **Special Block**: A 2x2 block in another region indicates the \"endpoint\" color.\n4. **Fill Region**: There are two distinct regions (like the irregular boundaries between colors).\n\n**The transformation:**\n- Erase the template and special block (replace with background)\n- From each marker, draw lines through the \"fill region\" using the template pattern\n- At boundaries where lines meet the background region, place the special color\n\n**For the test input:**\n- Template: 3,3,3,6 pattern (from 2x2 blocks at rows 1-2)\n- Markers: 3 at positions (14,0) and (26,0)\n- Special block: 7,7 at (25-26, 24-25)\n- Fill region: 9 (maroon), Background: 8 (gray)\n- Pattern drawn through 9-region, endpoints marked with 7\n\nThe pattern radiates from markers horizontally and vertically through the 9-region, with 7 marking boundaries.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,7,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n

I'm given three examples to understand how to solve an ARC problem. The user has provided an input grid, and I need to figure out what transformation needs to be applied. The problem involves a grid of integers, representing colors.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the inputs. The description mentions backgrounds, tracks, and objects with repeating patterns, called \"Patterned Sequences\" along tracks, which can have \"Markers\".\n\nMy job is to interpret the rules and apply them.\n\nRule 1 is about the \"Pattern\". It says to examine the top-left 2x2 color blocks to build a sequence. In the first example, this gave a `2,2,8` sequence. In the second, `4,1`, and the third gave `2,2,3`. These sequences are critical, and I've now correctly worked out that they correspond to the colors of distinct 2x2 blocks of similar color, appearing left to right, distinct from the background (which is usually a big field, or sea, of a single color in each example).\n\nRule 2 and 3 focus on \"markers\". I see these as small isolated blocks of color, which define a \"terminal marker\" color, used to erase parts of the input. I see these appearing at the terminal points on the output.\n\nRule 4 is about path traversal, a staircase: \"maximal right run, then maximal up run\". These are the main transformations. But I see that the problem has an initial \"start pixel\", and it must be a single location with the first color of the pattern.\n\nI must trace the track which has turns and runs, and apply the pattern to the track, changing the track at each point.\n\nI have found, after carefully working through, that at the *blocking cells*, at the turns, at the end of runs, the \"Marker\" is placed. I see that the track can continue even if the path has to go *into* a background of a different color. That means I have to follow the instructions carefully to trace that path.\n\nIn summary, the key elements are:\n\n1.  *Pattern Extraction*: find distinct, top-left blocks; the colors in order defines a sequence.\n2.  *Marker Definition*: identify a marker color that shows up as the color to paint the turns.\n3.  *Pathfinding*: a \"Staircase\" movement, but potentially going through background, and potentially looping back.\n4.  Apply the pattern to those parts of the track, applying markers correctly to the blocking or terminal cells at run ends (turns), which means applying a Marker color to the track when the track dead ends.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, we first identify the objects and roles as described in the instructions.\n\n**1. Pattern Identification:**\nWe examine the top-left area of the input grid to find the 2x2 blocks of color that define the repeating pattern.\n*   **Row 1**: Contains sequences like `8, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6...`.\n*   We identify the blocks distinct from the background/track (8) as three blocks of `3,3` and one block of `6,6`.\n*   Reading left-to-right, the pattern sequence is: **[3, 3, 3, 6]**.\n*   The **Start Color** is the first color of the pattern: **3**.\n\n**2. Terminal Marker Identification:**\nWe look for a separate 2x2 block of a distinct color.\n*   Near the bottom-right (Rows 26-27, Cols 24-25), we find a block of **7**s (`7,7`).\n*   The **Terminal Marker Color** is **7**.\n\n**3. Erasures:**\n*   The pattern blocks (`3,3` and `6,6` in Rows 1-2) are erased (repainted to the surrounding background color, **8**).\n*   The terminal marker block (`7,7` in Rows 26-27) is erased (repainted to **8**).\n\n**4. Track Traversal and Coloring:**\nThe \"track\" is the path of **9**s carved into the background of **8**s (or vice-versa, but the 9s form the winding paths connected to the start pixels). We look for start pixels matching the Start Color (**3**) and traverse the track of 9s using the staircase rule (Maximal Right, then Maximal Up).\n\n*   **Path 1:** Starts at **(14, 0)** (Color 3).\n    *   **Run Right**: (14,0) to (14,6). Pattern `3,3,3,6,3,3,3`.\n        *   Blocked by 8 at (14,7). Paint (14,7) -> **7**.\n    *   **Turn Up**: (14,6) to (7,6). Pattern `6,3,3,3,6,3,3`.\n        *   Blocked by 8 at (6,6). Paint (6,6) -> **7**.\n    *   **Turn Right**: (7,6) to (7,23). Pattern `3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3`.\n        *   Blocked by 8 at (7,24). Paint (7,24) -> **7**.\n    *   **Turn Up**: Attempt from (7,23). Blocked immediately by 8 at (6,23). Paint (6,23) -> **7**.\n    *   **Dead End**: Cannot go Right either. Paint last track cell (7,23) -> **7**.\n\n*   **Path 2:** Starts at **(26, 0)** (Color 3).\n    *   **Run Right**: (26,0) to (26,10). Pattern `3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3`.\n        *   Blocked by 8 at (26,11). Paint (26,11) -> **7**.\n    *   **Turn Up**: (26,10) to (18,10). Pattern `6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3`.\n        *   Blocked by 8 at (17,10). Paint (17,10) -> **7**.\n    *   **Turn Right**: (18,10) to (18,26). Pattern `6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3`.\n        *   Blocked by 8 at (18,27). Paint (18,27) -> **7**.\n    *   **Turn Up**: (18,26) to (8,26). Pattern `6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3`.\n        *   Blocked by 8 at (7,26). Paint (7,26) -> **7**.\n    *   **Turn Right**: (8,26) to (8,29). Pattern `3,3,6`.\n        *   Blocked by Boundary.\n    *   **Turn Up**: (8,29) to (7,29). Pattern `3` (overridden).\n        *   Blocked by 8 at (6,29). Paint (6,29) -> **7**.\n    *   **Dead End**: Cannot go Right (Boundary). Paint last track cell (7,29) -> **7**.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,7\n8,8,8,8,9,9,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,7,7,9,7,9,9,7\n3,3,6,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,6,3\n9,6,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n9,3,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,3,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,3,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,6,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,9,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,7,7,9,7,9,9,7\n      3,3,6,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,6,3\n      9,6,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n      9,3,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n      9,3,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n      9,3,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n      9,6,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n      3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n      9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"9\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Problem Breakdown and Solution Strategy**\n\nThe task is to solve an ARC (Abstract Reasoning Challenge) problem by generalizing the pattern from the given examples. I need to take a large input grid, understand the underlying transformation logic, and then apply it to the new test input to generate the correct output.\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation:** First, I need to understand the relationship between the examples and the provided object/transformation descriptions.  It involves identifying key elements: the background colors, tracks (winding paths),  \"template\" blocks that define a repeating pattern, a \"terminal-marker color,\" and the \"start pixel(s)\". The central concept seems to be a \"staircase\" traversal along tracks.\n\n2.  **Detailed Analysis of the Transformations in Examples:** I'll thoroughly analyze each example. I have to read the input grids carefully. I need to locate where those 2x2 blocks are, what defines \"track color\", \"terminal-markers\", and how the staircase algorithm operates (maximal right, maximal up). My aim is to derive and verify the step-by-step logic through manual inspection. I also need to verify that those starting/terminal points are really present in the corresponding input. I'll test each leg of the trajectory and the final \"marker\" location in the examples.\n\n3.  **Algorithmic Formulation:** I'll formalize the process. The algorithm involves: (1) Reading the Top Left Blocks to define the pattern. (2) Reading and erasing the terminal marker. (3) Finding the start pixel. (4) Identifying the Track color. (5) Traversing the track in a staircase manner using the pattern and marking the wall. (6) Performing the pattern colorings and wall marking.\n\n4.  **Application to the Test Input:** I will then apply my understanding to the 30x30 test input. First, I need to locate the template markers, the terminal marker and single start pixel on the provided input. Finally, I will construct a new grid, starting from the input, erasing the blocks and applying the defined coloring algorithm to identify the track and its correct pattern filling (and marking the correct cells).\n\n5.  **Output Generation:** Finally, I'll generate the resulting grid, ensuring the format (30x30 integers) is correct, and that all necessary transformations are applied in the correct order. The final result should look like the example's output.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we follow the transformation rules derived from the examples:\n\n1.  **Extract Pattern and Terminal Color**:\n    *   **Pattern**: Look at the small 2x2 blocks in the top-left area. In the test input, rows 1 and 2 contain blocks of `3,3` at columns 1-2, `3,3` at columns 4-5, `3,3` at columns 7-8, and `6,6` at columns 10-11. Reading these left-to-right gives the sequence **3, 3, 3, 6**.\n    *   **Erase Templates**: These blocks are erased (painted with the surrounding background color, which is **8**).\n    *   **Terminal Color**: Identify the distinct small block elsewhere. At rows 26-27, columns 24-25, there is a 2x2 block of `7,7`. The terminal color is **7**.\n    *   **Erase Terminal Marker**: This block is also erased (painted with background **8**).\n\n2.  **Identify Tracks and Start Pixels**:\n    *   Find single pixels matching the first pattern color (**3**).\n    *   **Start Pixel 1**: (14, 0).\n    *   **Start Pixel 2**: (27, 0).\n    *   For each start pixel, determine the \"track domain\" color by looking at the immediate right neighbor.\n        *   For (14,0), neighbor is (14,1) which is **9**. Track traverses 9s.\n        *   For (27,0), neighbor is (27,1) which is **9**. Track traverses 9s.\n\n3.  **Traverse and Fill Tracks**:\n    *   **Method**: From the start pixel, move **Right** until blocked (non-9 cell), then mark the blocking cell with the terminal color (**7**). Then move **Up** from the last track cell until blocked, mark the blocking cell, and turn Right again. Repeat.\n    *   **Coloring**: Fill the traversed cells with the repeating pattern `3, 3, 3, 6`. The start pixel is index 0.\n\n    **Track 1 Trace (Start 14,0):**\n    *   **Right**: (14,0) to (14,15). Blocked at (14,16). Mark (14,16)=7.\n        *   Sequence indices 0-15: `3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6`.\n    *   **Up**: (14,15) to (1,15). Blocked at (0,15). Mark (0,15)=7.\n        *   Sequence indices 16-29: (Starts with 3). Ends at (1,15) with 3.\n    *   **Right**: (1,15) to (1,21). Blocked at (1,22). Mark (1,22)=7.\n        *   Sequence indices 30-35. Ends at (1,21) with 3.\n    *   **Up**: (1,21) to (0,21). Blocked by grid edge (no wall above 0, or implied boundary). However, (0,22) is adjacent right.\n        *   Sequence index 36? Wait, pattern continues. (0,21) gets 6.\n        *   Next step Right from (0,21) hits (0,22) which is 8 (wall).

Read them **left to right** and record their colors (including repeats).  \n   In the test grid these blocks are: **3, 3, 3, 6**, so the repeating pattern is:  \n   **[3, 3, 3, 6]**\n\n2) **Erase the pattern templates**  \n   Repaint those 2\u00d72 blocks to the surrounding background color (here, **8**).\n\n3) **Find the terminal-marker color**  \n   Locate the separate small solid block elsewhere (here it is a **2\u00d72 block of 7**).  \n   Its color (**7**) is the terminal-marker color. Erase that block too (repaint to **8**).\n\n4) **Traverse each track from each start pixel**  \n   Find every **single pixel** whose color equals the **first pattern color** (here, **3**) and treat each as a start.  \n   From each start, the track color is the color it continues through (here it is **9**). Traverse in a staircase:\n   - go **as far right as possible** through track cells,\n   - then **as far up as possible**,\n   - repeat until stuck.\n\n5) **Recolor the traversed track cells**  \n   As you traverse, recolor visited track cells in order using the repeating pattern **[3,3,3,6]**, continuing across turns.\n\n6) **Place terminal markers at run ends**  \n   Whenever a run stops because the next cell is not track color:\n   - after a right-run, color the blocking cell **to the right** as **7**\n   - after an up-run, color the blocking cell **above** as **7**\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,9,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,7,8,7,8,9,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,6,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,7,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,9,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,7,8,7,8,9,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,6,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n      3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n      9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,7,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"12\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Analysis and Synthesis of ARC Task: Image Transformation**\n\nMy immediate task is to tackle an ARC problem that involves understanding and replicating image transformations. The problem presents examples of input grids and corresponding outputs, and my goal is to discern the underlying logic and apply it to a new input.\n\nMy initial approach is to analyze the simplest example. I begin by examining the grid sizes, color distributions, and visual patterns. The key observation is that the inputs often contain a \u201cbackground\u201d color and distinct, smaller patterns \u201cinclusions\u201d within them.\n\nI notice that the images appear to be composed of repeating blocks of pixels. Based on the patterns, I hypothesize that the task involves a *texture synthesis* process where a portion of the original texture (3) is moved to 0.\n\nBy analyzing the rows in Input 1 and Output 1, I observe what seems to be a rightward shift of patterns and, in some cases, the propagation or transfer of patterns from one region to another. My analysis suggests a translation of image components within the grid.\n\nTo be precise in describing the transformation, I look for fixed elements in both the input and output. I then extract the background map. I consider the possibility of a \"transparent overlay\". This leads me to believe the output image is a *composite* of a moving Pattern layer and a stationary Background.\n\nI then introduce the concept of Mask and Pattern layers. I test the hypothesis. I consider the Input, then formulate a Shift to derive the Output. I attempt to formulate general rules.\n\nThis leads me to the current hypothesis. In Example 2, the pattern of pixels that make up the image shift, so I focus on Example 2 and 3 and the provided Test Input to extract general rules. I note that each input/output combination shows distinct, though somewhat related, pattern transformations. I calculate the shift and consider the geometry of the blocks within the grid and note a periodicity of these blocks.\n\nThrough this analysis, I determine a general algorithm: The input will have at least two regions within a grid, each with a Background color, and the goal is to shift the smaller pattern from one region into the other to generate the Output. This involves:\n\n1.  Identifying the Background regions and outlier pixels.\n2.  Extracting the \"shift\" factor for row and columns by examining at least two example images.\n3.  Synthesizing (drawing) a new pattern on the empty region (or, more precisely, on the target/second region, and leaving the first region blank).\n\nIn this process, I carefully account for grid boundaries by performing \"wrap-around\" shifts and examine the outlier pixel in each grid to estimate shift. After multiple checks with test values, I use an estimated shift based on each outlier pixel to build the output grid.\n\n\nThe problem involves extracting a pattern from a \"source\" background region and propagating it to a \"destination\" background region with a specific spatial shift.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Decomposition into Background and Pattern:**\n    *   **Backgrounds:** Each grid consists of two dominant colors defining large regions.\n        *   Example 1: Color 3 (green) and Color 0 (black).\n        *   Example 2: Color 2 (red) and Color 8 (teal).\n        *   Example 3: Color 1 (blue) and Color 4 (yellow).\n        *   Test Input: Color 8 (teal) and Color 9 (maroon).\n    *   **Pattern:** Small distinct colored pixels or blocks appear overlaid on the \"Source\" background (the one appearing in the top-left).\n        *   Example 1: 2, 8, 4 on Background 3.\n        *   Example 2: 4, 1, 9 on Background 2.\n        *   Example 3: 2, 3, 8 on Background 1.\n        *   Test Input: 3, 6, 7 on Background 8.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   The pattern is **removed** from the Source Background (leaving it clean).\n    *   The pattern is **transferred** to the Destination Background.\n    *   The transfer involves a **translation (shift)** of the pattern coordinates.\n    *   **Shift Calculation:**\n        *   Comparing the positions of specific pattern elements (e.g., the \"outlier\" single blocks like the 4 in Ex 1, 9 in Ex 2, 8 in Ex 3, 7 in Test) or the start of the repeating blocks.\n        *   Example 1 (20x20): Shift is `(+3, +12)`.\n        *   Example 2 (25x25): Shift is `(+2, +13)`.\n        *   Example 3 (25x25): Shift is `(+3, +19)`.\n    *   **Inference for Test Input (30x30):**\n        *   The row shift `dr` appears to be `+3` (consistent with Ex 1 and Ex 3).\n        *   The column shift `dc` appears to be half the grid width (`W/2`), or related to centering the pattern in the destination region.\n        *   For 20x20, `dc=12` (approx half). For 25x25, `dc=13` (approx half).\n        *   For 30x30, we assume `dc = 15`.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Source:** Background 8. **Destination:** Background 9.\n    *   **Pattern Elements in Source:**\n        *   Rows 1 and 2: `3,3` at cols 1, 4, 7; `6,6` at col 10.\n        *   Row 14: `3` at col 0.\n        *   Row 26: `7,7` at cols 24, 25.\n        *   Row 27: `3` at col 0.\n    *   **Apply Shift `(dr=+3, dc=+15)`:**\n        *   **Rows 1 & 2** shift to **Rows 4 & 5**.\n            *   `3,3` at `1+15=16`. (Cols 16, 17)\n            *   `3,3` at `4+15=19`. (Cols 19, 20)\n            *   `3,3` at `7+15=22`. (Cols 22, 23)\n            *   `6,6` at `10+15=25`. (Cols 25, 26)\n        *   **Row 14** shifts to **Row 17**.\n            *   `3` at `0+15=15`.\n        *   **Row 26** shifts to **Row 29**.\n            *   `7,7` at `24+15=39`. Mod 30 -> **9**. (Cols 9, 10).\n        *   **Row 27** shifts to **Row 30** -> **Row 0**.\n            *   Row 0 is entirely Background 8 (Source). The pattern is only visible on the Destination Background (9). Thus, elements shifted into the Source region are occluded/removed.\n    *   **Construction:**\n        *   Start with a clean grid of Backgrounds 8 and 9 (using the layout from the input).\n        *

model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Pattern Template**: In the top-left area, there are 2x2 blocks (like 3,3 and 6,6) that define a repeating pattern for the lines.\n\n2. **Marker Pixels**: Single pixels (3 at positions (14,0) and (26,0)) in the secondary region (9) indicate where lines originate.\n\n3. **Endpoint Marker**: The 7,7 block in the 8-region defines the endpoint color.\n\n4. **Line Drawing**: From each marker, horizontal lines extend through the secondary region (9), and vertical lines extend from line endpoints to form cross patterns.\n\n**Transformation Steps:**\n- Clear template area (rows 1-2, cols 1-11) to background (8)\n- From marker at (14,0): Draw horizontal line through 9-region (cols 0-6) with pattern 3,3,3,6; vertical line at col 6 (rows 6-14); horizontal extension at row 6\n- From marker at (26,0): Draw horizontal line (cols 0-10); vertical line at col 10 (rows 18-26); horizontal extension at row 18\n- Place endpoint marker 7 at region boundaries\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,7,8,8,8,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,7,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n

I'm faced with this ARC task, and my mind's already racing, trying to get a handle on it. It's a grid, and it seems like there are patterns hidden within it. First, I'm just trying to understand the basic structure. There's a background, which seems to be black (0), and then there's this path or river made of green (3s). What\u2019s inside the river? There are these different colored pixels, and it's starting to look like these pixels have something to do with the overall structure. Okay, so I'm trying to see if this path is somehow shifted and what the shift is.\n\nNow, I'm starting to notice that there are maybe two different patterns that overlap, but I still have to figure out how they relate. This path that's made of green (3s), seems to wind throughout the whole grid. I'm focusing on trying to compare the Input and the Output, and I'm really looking at where the changes are happening. If I look closely at the Input and Output for the Example 1, it looks like this \"tape\" is changing, and the content is shifted or repeated.\n\nI\u2019m starting to think this is a shape-based problem, but how are the colors changing, and what is the underlying rule? I\u2019m thinking there is something about a continuous ribbon or a 1D sequence that's winding through the 2D grid. The foreground, which is anything other than the background, seems like it's forming a single component. I can see the connectivity, which could define the shape. It seems like the foreground pixels form a single 1D sequence that winds through the 2D grid, so the transformation is happening in this 1D space.\n\nI'm thinking, is this a shift along a ribbon? To figure this out, I need to look at the width of the path. If I unroll the path, is there an order? Standard snake order? I start looking at how the empty space works to see if there is a pattern. It looks like parts of the image are separated, and this is where I start thinking this is more complicated than a straight shift. And where do the colors change? I\u2019m looking at the output, and now the colors have shifted position.\n\nNow, I\u2019m thinking that this might be a single continuous tape.  I\u2019m considering: maybe the entire grid is just a raster scan of a long string. So I form the algorithm hypothesis. The goal is to figure out the color transformation on this 1D array, and I want to see if the colors are being shifted or reversed.\n\nI\u2019m focusing on Example 1: I see the sequence of foreground pixels, and it seems like these pixels in the output are shifted and repeating. There seems to be cyclic shift here, and what is the direction? Where did it come from? The pattern is not matching up perfectly: the 3s are interrupting the pattern. Are the 3s part of the sequence, or are they transparent? It looks like the pattern ignores the 3s?\n\nLet's test the 3s, are they part of the shift? Yes, the 3s are shifted along with the other colors, so they are part of the stream. What is the shift amount? If it's the shift, is the shape of this ribbon being compressed? What is the order? Now I\u2019m thinking, this might be a spiral or snake, and I start looking at how the rows are connected.\n\nNow, I\u2019m seeing that the pixel counts change. This is not a permutation or shift.  The rule must be more complex, and I'm thinking about a pattern. It looks like there are two patterns for these images. Maybe it's a SWAP of regions: in the input, the top contains the A pattern, and the bottom contains the B pattern, and in the output, it switches.\n\nLet's check Example 2: there is a region with 2s and another region with 8s. It turns out that there is more complex pattern-shifting or flow, so now I'm starting to think the path can be more like the region itself, and the color change comes from the region. I need to be more precise about the shift.\n\nNow, I'm getting a little more clarity: I need a \"Carrier\" and a \"Payload\". It\u2019s all about the transformation of the payload. So I go back to Example 1, focusing on the reading order, and I'm seeing that it is a cyclic shift. Let\u2019s double-check with Example 2, and what I\u2019m seeing is that there is a cyclic shift along the path. \n\nThis makes me re\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by identifying a sequence of \"payload\" patterns embedded in a path or regions, and then applying a transformation to that sequence. Based on the solved examples, the transformation is a **reversal of the sequence of payload blocks** defined by the connected components (regions) of the grid.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Decomposition:** The grid is composed of \"Background\" regions and \"Payload\" pixels.\n    *   **Regions:** These are large connected areas of a single color. In the test input, we have regions of **8** (Teal) and **9** (Maroon).\n    *   **Components:** We identify the regions in standard reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right based on first appearance).\n        1.  **C1 (Top-Left 8s):** Contains payload `3`s and `6`s.\n        2.  **C2 (Middle 9s):** This large region acts as a container. It contains a large block of `8`s (which is payload, as it's inside the 9-region) and scattered `3`s.\n        3.  **C3 (Top-Right 8s):** Contains no payload.\n        4.  **C4 (Bottom-Right 8s):** Contains payload `7`s.\n    *   **Payload:** The non-background pixels within each component.\n        *   $P(C1)$: Pairs of `3`s and `6`s. Sequence: `3,3, 3,3, 3,3, 6,6, 6,6`. (16 pixels).\n        *   $P(C2)$: The `8` block and `3`s. Sequence: `8`s (approx 40), `3`s (3 pixels).\n        *   $P(C3)$: Empty.\n        *   $P(C4)$: Pairs of `7`s. Sequence: `7,7, 7,7` (4 pixels).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:** The sequence of payload blocks is **reversed**.\n    *   Original Component Order: C1, C2, C3, C4.\n    *   Original Payload Sequence: $P(C1) \\to P(C2) \\to P(C3) \\to P(C4)$.\n    *   Transformed Payload Sequence: $P(C4) \\to P(C3) \\to P(C2) \\to P(C1)$.\n\n3.  **Application:** We fill the *original payload slots* of the components with the *new payload sequence*.\n    *   **Fill C1 Slots:** The slots originally holding `3`s and `6`s (16 slots) are filled first.\n        *   Source: $P(C4)$ (`7`s) then start of $P(C2)$ (`8`s).\n        *   The 4 `7` pixels fill the first 4 slots (Row 1's `3,3`, `3,3`).\n        *   The `8` pixels (from the start of the `8` block in C2) fill the remaining 12 slots. Since `8` is the background color of C1, these pixels effectively disappear (become background). There is one isolated `3` from the C2 payload stream that lands in C1 (at Row 2, Slot 3), but generally, the rest become 8.\n    *   **Fill C2 Slots:** The slots originally holding the `8` block and `3`s.\n        *   Source: Remainder of $P(C2)$ then $P(C1)$.\n        *   The remaining `8`s fill the beginning of the `8` block slots.\n        *   When `8`s run out, the slots are filled with $P(C1)$ content: `3`s then `6`s.\n        *   This means the end of the `8` block (around Row 17) and the scattered `3` slots will turn into `3`s and `6`s.\n    *   **Fill C4 Slots:** The slots originally holding `7`s (4 slots).\n        *   Source: End of $P(C1)$ (`6`s).\n        *   The `7,7` pixels become `6,6`.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\n*   **Row 1:** The `3,3` `3,3` become `7,7` `7,7`. The remaining `3,3` `6,6` become `8,8` `8,8`.\n*   **Row 2:** The `3,3` `3,3` `3,3` `6,6` become `8,8` `8,8` `3,8` `8,8` (due to the single `3` in the stream).\n*   **Row 17:** The bottom of the `8` block turns into `3`s.\n*   **Row 26/27:** The `7,7` become `6,6`.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,7,7,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_8_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Problem Breakdown and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I have to solve for a pattern using three examples and a single test input. It looks like each grid represents some sort of color-coded environment with source points, destination points, and obstacles.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Understanding:**\nI need to examine the grid and its corresponding output. I am mapping the numbers in the grid to their respective colors. From Example 1, I can see a \"path\" being constructed in the output and I must identify the start point which is a block of colors (2, 8). Destination is at a block with color 4 (Yellow) and is positioned far from the source. I can see the \"path\" is a connecting line between the source and destination. The path has some specific color-based pattern: in the output sequence of Example 1, it's a repeating pattern of colors. Specifically, the color pattern is Red, Teal, Yellow. It seems the input defines a shape.  From that shape, the Output is a path. The output shapes are color coded to the input shape colors.\n\n**Identifying the Core Logic:**\nAfter carefully studying the different examples, I deduce that the crucial part is identifying the sources and their colors. These sources seem to initiate paths within the grid. The paths follow a specific structure: a repeating color-coded \"bus\" or \"snake\" (In other words, the path is a repeating sequence of colors), which connects to a destination. The repeating sequence is just a repeating pattern, which can be seen in the Output Example grids. Then, looking at the examples, the destination's color will be included in the output path.\n\n**Path Construction and Pattern Detection:**\nIn each example, the source blocks are arranged horizontally, while the destination is at the bottom. By examining the examples, it is evident that the sequence of colors in the paths is determined by the input sources. I have discovered that the output always begins at the sources. For example, for example 1: Sources were (Red, Red, Teal), which translated to (2,2,8) which became the source in the output. Therefore, the goal is to get a generalized solution which will work for the test input.\n\n**Generalizing the Solution and Handling Edge Cases:**\nThe path always connects the input's source block to the output destination block, following the pattern derived from the examples. For the test input, The source and destinations are identified (the input is a grid with specified rows and columns), I am confident that I can replicate the logic used for the test input. The \"path\" will be constructed by replicating the same steps and processes. The task is to construct this path from the data provided in the test input. The path must go from the source and destination in the shortest path, while also following a specific sequence of colors (pattern) in the input grid provided.\n\n**Specifically:**\nFor the test Input, I need to analyze the data, determine the source and destination. Then construct the shortest path in the grid, such that the sequence of colors in the path is equal to the source color pattern. I have identified the source block and target in the test input, and will implement this approach with the data in hand. I am ready to generate the final output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to connect \"source\" ports to a \"destination\" port using a specific path pattern.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Identify Sources:** The sources are distinct colored blocks located on the boundary of a region (usually top-left). We extract the sequence of colors from these blocks.\n    *   Example 1: Red (`2`), Red (`2`), Cyan (`8`). Pattern length 3: `2, 2, 8`.\n    *   Example 2: Yellow (`4`), Blue (`1`). Pattern length 2: `4, 1`.\n    *   Example 3: Red (`2`), Red (`2`), Green (`3`). Pattern length 3: `2, 2, 3`.\n    *   **Test Input:** The sources are three Green (`3`) blocks and one Magenta (`6`) block. The sequence is Green, Green, Green, Magenta. Pattern length 4: `3, 3, 3, 6`.\n\n2.  **Identify Destination:** The destination is a colored block on the opposite side (usually bottom-right).\n    *   Test Input: The destination is an Orange (`7`) block located at rows 25-26, columns 24-25.\n\n3.  **Construct Path:** A path is drawn connecting the sources to the destination.\n    *   The path consists of the repeating color pattern derived from the sources.\n    *   The path geometry in the examples follows a \"Manhattan\" route: typically extending horizontally from the sources, then vertically to the destination row/column, then horizontally to the target.\n    *   The path width matches the width of the source blocks (2 pixels in the Test Input).\n    *   The path overwrites the \"void\" or background regions but stops adjacent to the destination.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Pattern:** `3, 3, 3, 6` (Green, Green, Green, Magenta).\n*   **Sources Location:** Rows 1-2, extending up to Column 11.\n*   **Destination Location:** Rows 25-26, Columns 24-25.\n*   **Routing:**\n    1.  **Horizontal Extension:** Extend the path from the end of the sources (Column 12) to the right, aligning with the destination column (Column 24). This covers Rows 1-2 from Column 12 to 23.\n    2.  **Vertical Extension:** Drop down from the horizontal extension to reach the destination. This covers Columns 24-25 from Row 1 down to Row 24 (stopping just above the target at Row 25).\n\n*   **Coloring Logic:**\n    *   The color at any coordinate `(r, c)` on the path follows the pattern cyclically based on the coordinate.\n    *   For the horizontal segment (Rows 1-2), the color corresponds to `c % 4`.\n        *   `c % 4 == 0` -> `3`\n        *   `c % 4 == 1` -> `3`\n        *   `c % 4 == 2` -> `3`\n        *   `c % 4 == 3` -> `6`\n    *   For the vertical segment (Cols 24-25), the color corresponds to `r % 4`.\n        *   `r % 4 == 0` -> `3`\n        *   `r % 4 == 1` -> `3`\n        *   `r % 4 == 2` -> `3`\n        *   `r % 4 == 3` -> `6`\n    *   This logic ensures the pattern flows continuously and matches the intersections correctly.\n\n**Resolution Steps:**\n1.  Copy the input grid.\n2.  Fill the region `Rows 1-2` and `Cols 12-23` with the pattern based on `col % 4`.\n3.  Fill the region `Rows 1-24` and `Cols 24-25` with the pattern based on `row % 4`.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,8,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,3,9,9,9\n3,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,3,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,6,6,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,8,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,3,9,9,9\n      3,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,3,9,9,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,6,6,9,9,8\n      9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,9,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"17\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_7_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**The core idea:** I'm being asked to solve an ARC puzzle where the solution involves drawing a path based on a repeating color pattern. The path connects \"start\" points (isolated pixels or small groups of pixels), to a target area (a larger colored block), while avoiding specific obstacles.\n\n**Here's my thought process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the examples:** I look at the provided inputs and outputs to discern the underlying logic. The goal is to figure out the rules governing how the path is constructed, how it's colored, and what determines its route. The focus is on the top-left section (the \"pattern\"), the starting points, the target, and any obstacles in the background. I pay close attention to the input grids and their corresponding output paths, meticulously trying to see the connections.\n\n2.  **Identify the repeating pattern:** I realize the key to the puzzle is a repeating sequence of colors. This sequence comes from the arrangement of colored blocks in the top-left area of the input grid. I note down the colors and the order to identify the pattern that drives the entire path.\n\n3.  **Find the starting points:** Based on the examples, I know the path will emerge from small, isolated blocks of color along the left edge of the grid. I try to understand the logic behind these start points.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the destination:** I recognize a specific, distinctly colored block that serves as the target or the ending point of the path. The path must navigate towards this target or potentially pass through it.\n\n5.  **Uncover the Pathfinding Logic:** I analyze the input and output grids to understand the rules for drawing the path. I observe that the path's route is shaped by the presence of obstacles (colored backgrounds in the grid) and perhaps the relative position of the start and end points. It seems that the path is determined by a boundary (or wall) between two distinct colors. The paths appear to expand from start locations and then connect by a vertical path, and then the vertical paths are linked to the goal.\n\n6.  **Deconstruct the Pattern:** The colors of each path segment are not random. The color sequence (originating from the top-left area) gets repeated along each section of the drawn path.\n\n7.  **Hypothesize the core rules:** I formulate the working hypothesis. It goes like this:\n\n    *   **The Legend:** The color sequence from the top-left determines the \"pattern\".\n    *   **The Start:** Starting pixels on the left.\n    *   **The Turn:** The path extends until it hits the boundary of a different color, which causes a \"turn.\" The turning point is where I'll use the Target Color.\n    *   **The Boundary Crawler:** The boundary will be traced. Vertical segments, etc. It seems to \"jump\" until at the target location.\n\n8.  **Test and Refine:** With this working hypothesis, I review the examples to see if the rules hold true. It's a game of pattern recognition, careful comparison of the input and the output, and constant refinement. It means confirming, testing, and modifying until a solid, replicable set of steps is in place for all scenarios.\n\n9.  **Translate to Code or Steps:** Once I have the algorithm, I need to generate the actual output grid. I plan to construct the path and fill the grid.\n\n10. **Apply to the Test Input:** I'll apply these steps to the new test input and generate the final output. The goal is to accurately draw the path based on the logic I've uncovered.\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we need to identify the rules governing the generation of paths based on the provided examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n1.  **Pattern Identification:**\n    *   In each example, there is a set of colored blocks in the top-left corner that acts as a \"Legend\" or \"Header\". This sequence of colors defines the repeating pattern of the path.\n    *   *Example 1:* Red (2), Red (2), Teal (8) $\\rightarrow$ Path Pattern: **2, 2, 8**.\n    *   *Example 2:* Yellow (4), Blue (1) $\\rightarrow$ Path Pattern: **4, 1**.\n    *   *Example 3:* Red (2), Red (2), Green (3) $\\rightarrow$ Path Pattern: **2, 2, 3**.\n    *   *Test Input:* Green (3), Green (3), Green (3), Magenta (6) $\\rightarrow$ Path Pattern: **3, 3, 3, 6**.\n\n2.  **Start Points:**\n    *   Paths originate from the \"Legend\" blocks themselves and from any single pixels on the left edge of the grid that match the first color of the pattern.\n    *   *Test Input:* Starts are at Row 14 (3) and Row 26 (3), plus the Legend path at Row 1.\n\n3.  **Target and Turns:**\n    *   There is a unique 2x2 block of a specific color in the grid that acts as the final destination.\n    *   *Example 1:* Yellow (4). *Example 2:* Dark Red (9). *Example 3:* Teal (8).\n    *   *Test Input:* The unique block is Orange (**7**) at the bottom right.\n    *   **Rule:** When a path turns or intersects a boundary, the turning pixel is colored with the Target color (7).\n\n4.  **Path Logic:**\n    *   **Horizontal Extension:** From each start point, extend a horizontal path to the right. The path consists of the repeating pattern colors.\n    *   **Stopping Condition:** The horizontal path stops when it encounters a \"Wall\" (a change in background color). The last cell of the path (the one before the wall) becomes a **Turn Point** and is colored with the Target color.\n    *   **Vertical Connection:** A vertical (or diagonal) path connects all the Turn Points. It follows the boundary of the regions (\"hugging the wall\") to connect the upper paths to the lower paths and finally to the Target block.\n    *   **Final Leg:** From the lowest Turn Point (aligned with the Target's row), the path shoots horizontally to the Target.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Legend:** 3, 3, 3, 6.\n2.  **Starts:**\n    *   **Row 1 (Legend):** Extends right through the Teal (8) region. Hits a Maroon (9) wall at Col 15. Turn point at **(1, 14)**.\n    *   **Row 14:** Starts at Col 0 (3). Extends right through Maroon (9) region. Hits a Teal (8) wall at Col 7. Turn point at **(14, 6)**.\n    *   **Row 26:** Starts at Col 0 (3). Extends right through Maroon (9) region. Hits a Teal (8) wall at Col 11. Turn point at **(26, 10)**.\n3.  **Target:** Orange (7) at **(25, 24)**.\n    *   The vertical connector must link (1,14) $\\rightarrow$ (14,6) $\\rightarrow$ (26,10).\n    *   Since the Target is at Row 25, the path will likely turn right from the vertical boundary at Row 25. The boundary at Row 25 matches Row 26 (Col 10). So there is a Turn Point at **(25, 10)**.\n    *   Final path goes from (25, 10) to Target at (25, 24).\n\n**Step-by-Step Path Construction:**\n\n*   **Row 14 Path:** Start 3. Pattern: 3,3,3,6.\n    *   (14,1):3, (14,2):3, (14,3):6, (14,4):3, (14,5):3.\n    *   (14,6): **7** (Turn).\n*   **Row 26 Path:** Start 3. Pattern: 3,3,3,6.\n    *   (26,1):3, (26,2):3, (26,3):6, (26,4):3, (26,5):3, (26,6):3, (26,7):6, (26,8):3, (26,9):3.\n    *   (26,10): **7** (Turn).\n*   **Row 1 Path:** Legend ends at 11. Path starts 12.\n    *   (1,12):3, (1,13):3.\n    *   (1,14): **7** (Turn).\n*   **Vertical Connections:**\n    *   Connect (1,14) to (14,6) following the boundary.

grid (separated by an irregular diagonal boundary)\n2. **Pattern markers** (2x2 colored blocks) in one region define a repeating sequence\n3. **Anchor points** (single colored cells) exist in the other region\n4. **Destination marker** (another 2x2 block) marks where lines should connect\n5. **Lines are drawn** from anchors along the boundary between regions using the pattern sequence, with destination marker color at corners/endpoints\n\nFor the test input:\n- Main regions: gray (8) and yellow (9)\n- Pattern from 2x2 blocks: 3,3,3,6 (reading the unique colors)\n- Destination marker: 7 (bottom-right gray area)\n- Anchors: 3 at positions (14,0) and (26,0)\n\nThe transformation draws pattern lines through the yellow (9) region along its boundary with gray (8), using pattern 3,3,3,6 repeating, with 7 marking corners and endpoints.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,7,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,7,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,3,7,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n

large region).\n- A set of **small 2\u00d72 color blocks in the top-left**: these blocks (read **left\u2192right**) define a **repeating color sequence** used to draw \u201croads\u201d.\n- A **single 2\u00d72 block elsewhere** (often near the bottom-right): its color is a **cap/marker color** used at road endpoints and turns.\n- One or more **single cells on the left border** in the *first* sequence color: these are **road start points**.\n\n**Steps**\n1. **Read the road pattern**: scan the top-left 2\u00d72 blocks from left to right; record their colors as a sequence (duplicates kept).  \n2. **Read the cap color**: the lone 2\u00d72 block of a different color gives the cap color.\n3. **Erase the marker blocks**: replace all top-left 2\u00d72 pattern blocks and the 2\u00d72 cap-color block with the surrounding background color.\n4. **For each left-edge start cell**, draw one road through the large region adjacent to it (the cell immediately to its right gives the region color):\n   - Start moving **right**, then **up**, then **right**, then **up**, \u2026 (alternating).\n   - In each direction, continue through contiguous region cells until blocked.\n   - Color the traversed cells using the repeating sequence, **continuing the sequence across turns** (do not reset at turns).\n   - When a segment is blocked by a non-region cell **inside the grid**, place the **cap color** in that blocking cell.\n   - Stop if you reach the **right edge**, the **top edge**, or if after a horizontal segment you cannot move up.\n\n### Applied to the test\n- Pattern blocks (top-left) give sequence: **[3, 3, 3, 6]**\n- Cap block gives cap color: **7**\n- Two start points on the left edge at rows 15 and 27.\n- Roads are drawn through the **9** region.\n\n### Output

background/region colors).  \n2) In the **top-left** there is a row of **2\u00d72 \u201cpalette\u201d blocks** (colors not equal to the terrain colors). Reading these blocks **left\u2192right** gives the **repeating road pattern** (duplicates matter). These palette blocks are removed in the output (restored to the terrain color under them).\n3) Somewhere else there is a **2\u00d72 block of a third non\u2011terrain color**. This color is used for **corner markers** (turn/end markers), and that 2\u00d72 block is also removed (restored to the underlying terrain color).\n4) There are one or more **single cells on the left edge** in the **first palette color**. Each is a **start point**.\n5) From each start point, draw a **staircase path inside the terrain region that surrounds the start**:\n   - Go **right** through that region until the next cell would leave it. Color the traversed cells with the palette pattern, continuing the sequence across turns.\n   - If the stopping cell has an in-bounds neighbor to the right that is outside the region, color that outside cell with the **corner color**.\n   - Then go **up** from the endpoint as far as possible inside the region. If the cell above the topmost road cell is in-bounds and outside the region, color it with the corner color.\n   - Alternate **right, up, right, up\u2026** until you either (a) end a segment on the grid edge in the movement direction, or (b) after turning you cannot move even one step.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test\n- Terrain colors are **8 and 9**.\n- Palette blocks at top-left give pattern **[3, 3, 3, 6]**.\n- Corner-color block is **7** (2\u00d72 at rows 26\u201327, cols 24\u201325), so corners use **7**, and that block is removed to 8.\n- Start points (left edge, color 3): at **(15,0)** and **(27,0)**.\n- The region around each start is color **9**, so roads are drawn through the 9-region.\n\nResulting output grid:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,7,8,7,8,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,6,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,9,9,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,7,8,7,8,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,6,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9\n      3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,8\n      9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"21\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Solution Synthesis**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan for solving this ARC task. My goal is to transform the test input based on the rules I've deduced from analyzing the three examples. The core idea is that I'm dealing with drawing line structures that overlay a base image. Let me break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Pattern Extraction:** I begin by understanding that the top-left section of each input image contains the key to the line-drawing pattern. Specifically, I'm looking at the second row (index 1) of non-background colors. Within this row, these non-background colors will be grouped into distinct blocks/sequences. This sequence is then applied in the form of the line-drawing.\n\n2.  **Determining the Line Pattern:**  For each contiguous block of colors (i.e. if the background colour, '0', doesn't exist between a grouping of the same non-background colour), I take *one* pixel of that color, for use in the overall sequence. For example, if the top-left section has `2, 2, 8, 8`, the sequence extracted will be `2, 8`. From this, my goal is to derive the overall line drawing pattern.\n\n3.  **Initiating and Defining the Draw Path:** I look for the start markers. These are the pixels at the far left of the image. The line *begins* at the lone marker (single non-background color pixel) located on the left edge. I start drawing the pattern. To determine what is being drawn on, it is colour that exists *immediately* to the right of the lone marker.\n\n4.  **Implementing the Line-drawing Behavior:** The line follows the rule of drawing until it meets the background color or until I hit an \"obstacle\" - defined by a change in colour, meaning a change of the colour currently being drawn over.  It keeps drawing this pixel value until a change occurs (be it an interruption or the boundary of the image). At this point, I place the junction color and then change direction, continuing the pattern until another restriction is met.\n\n5.  **Handling Turns and Junctions:** The rule for turns is that they are all clockwise. Junctions are implemented on counter-clockwise changes.\n\n6.  **Overall Behavior:** The idea is to draw the lines, taking into consideration the rules above.\n\nIn summary, I look at the start marker, determine the sequence and start the line. The line stops at a junction/end-point (the junction color). Then, I repeat for as long as needed.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples, the transformation involves drawing a path or loop of colored lines over the image, driven by specific \"instruction\" markers and a \"palette\" of colors found in the input.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Pattern Palette**: The sequence of line colors is derived from the contiguous blocks of non-background colors in the second row (index 1) of the input grid.\n    *   In the test input, row 1 contains `8, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, ...` (with background 8).\n    *   The blocks are `3, 3` (Green), `3, 3` (Green), `3, 3` (Green), and `6, 6` (Magenta).\n    *   The repeating pattern unit is constructed by taking one pixel for each block: **`3, 3, 3, 6`**.\n\n2.  **Start Markers**: The drawing starts at the \"lone marker\" pixels found on the left edge (column 0).\n    *   In the test input, there are markers of color **3** at **(14, 0)** and **(26, 0)**.\n\n3.  **Path Tracing**: The lines are drawn starting from the markers. The direction is initially to the Right. The line overwrites the existing pixels (color 9) until it hits an \"obstacle\" (a different color, here 8).\n    *   Start at (26, 0). Move Right on 9s. Hit obstacle 8 at col 7. Stop at col 6.\n    *   Turn Left (Counter-Clockwise) because turning Right is blocked by edge/obstacle. New direction Up.\n    *   Move Up on 9s. Hit obstacle 8 at row 13. Stop at row 14.\n    *   Turn Left. New direction Left.\n    *   Move Left on 9s. Hit obstacle 3 (Start Marker) at col 0. Stop at col 0.\n    *   Turn Left. New direction Down.\n    *   Move Down on 9s. Hit obstacle 3 (Start Marker) at row 26. Stop at row 26.\n    *   This closes the loop. (Note: Starting at (14,0) and going Right would produce a Clockwise loop, but Example 1 suggests Junction markers appear at Left turns. A CCW loop produces Left turns at every corner).\n\n4.  **Junctions**: A \"Junction Marker\" is placed at corners where the path turns Left. The color is determined by the distinct 2x2 block in the lower-right area of the input.\n    *   In the test input, there is a block of **7**s (Orange) at (25, 24). So the Junction color is **7**.\n    *   The corners of the loop (14,0), (14,6), (26,6), (26,0) will be colored 7.\n\n5.  **Path Pattern Application**: The pattern `3, 3, 3, 6` is applied sequentially along the path (excluding the junction corners).\n    *   **Bottom Edge** (26, 1 to 26, 5): `3, 3, 6, 3, 3`.\n    *   **Right Edge** (25, 6 to 15, 6): `6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3`.\n    *   **Top Edge** (14, 5 to 14, 1): `6, 3, 3, 3, 6`.\n    *   **Left Edge** (15, 0 to 25, 0): `6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3`.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\nThe output is the input grid with the calculated loop drawn on it.

I'll start by breaking down each example, trying to find consistent patterns and rules in how the input grids change into the outputs. I'll need to figure out the roles of different colored blocks, their placement, and how a path's color and direction is determined.  I am hoping to figure out the \"algorithm\".\n\n**Example Breakdown & Pattern Discovery**\n\n*   **Example 1**:  Initially, I see a mostly black grid with a large \"blob\" that has holes within it. I notice clusters of colored markers (2, 8, and 4 in different corners). The output grid is the same black and green structure but a path added that connects these holes.  The path uses the colors 2, 8 and 4. The path is a zig zag or stairs.\n    *   **Hints**:   The hints are key: The main shape stays the same. The marker colors and their placement define segments and turns. A separate marker is used at the \"bends\".\n    *   **Important Observation**: It looks like the markers INSIDE the blob tell us the colors of the lines of the path and the color of the turns in the path, but they are *removed* from the output.  The background color is usually preserved but the path is carved from the blob.\n*   **Example 2**:   Similar setup, but now there are two distinct start/end points, and a single marker outside the \"blob\". The output has multiple lines that are parallel to edges.\n    *   **Key**: Horizontal line. The single points on the edge draw horizontal lines to the boundary. Another marker causes a vertical line. I'm starting to think these lone markers are \"emitters\". They send out these lines. I think the geometry, or open space next to the wall will be important.\n    *   **Hint**: The multiple lines start to project from the markers to hit the blob and turn. Then a second line goes up.\n*   **Example 3**:  It seems like Example 3 gives me more specific color pattern. Here, the blob color is changed. Now, I see two paths are drawn.\n    *   **The Big Picture** I think the rule is clear. A color is projected. The singletons on the outer edges are special. I need to figure out how each color projects to cause the turns.\n    *   **Important**: In this one, It looks like the lines are actually created by erasing or modifying the underlying \"blob\" color, not just being drawn ON TOP of it.  I'm really starting to see the pattern. It also seems the \"7\" turn marker causes a stop.\n\n**Formulating the Algorithm**\n\n1.  **Color Identification**:   Determine the \"Background\", the \"Blob\", the \"Line Palette\" (colors that will be used in the path), and the \"Turn Color\".\n2.  **Path Construction**:\n    *   Starting Point: Find the lone markers on the edge of a blob, *if adjacent to the empty space.*\n    *   Line Creation: The path goes from a marked pixel in one of the colors that borders empty space, and the marker colors will define the segments that make up the line.\n    *   Coloring: Line alternates \"Line Palette\" colors.\n    *   Stop Condition: When the path hits the \"wall\" or edge.\n3.  **Turning Logic**: This is the heart of the challenge:\n    *   Hit a Wall: if the next spot in the direction we are going is occupied by the \"Blob\" color or by a wall of the grid\n    *   Check for open or occupied spots (left/right of the direction).\n    *   If there's an open spot: put the \"Turn Color\". Turn 90 degrees and continue\n    *   If both or none orthogonal directions are open: Stop at the Wall.\n\n**Test Case Application**\nApplying this to the example, it looks correct:\n\n1.  Identify color:  Blue \"empty\", Yellow blob, The Start marker pixel is at the edge. The line runs through the \"Blob\". Turn is \"8\".  There's no marker at the edge.\n\n**Key Insight:** Path can be in blob. Not the Background.\n\n**Applying Algorithm**\n\nNow, I think I have a solid algorithm.  The tricky part will be the implementation to ensure that all the color patterns are correct, and all the \"turn\" rules are applied correctly.  I'll need to double check the segment lengths match the original examples. The path is \"projected\" through the matrix. The blob and background colors can sometimes be reversed.\n\nTo solve this task, I will apply the logic derived from the examples:\n\n1.  **Identify Roles of Colors:**\n    *   **Background:** 9 (Maroon). This is the color filling the large empty channels where lines will be drawn.\n    *   **Blob:** 8 (Teal). This is the color of the walls/obstacles.\n    *   **Start Markers:** 3 (Green). Found as single pixels on the left boundary (`(14,0)` and `(26,0)`).\n    *   **Line Palette:** Found in the top-left cluster inside the blob. `3,3` and `6,6` inside the 8-region. The pattern is derived from the counts: `3,3` appears three times in the cluster (or implies a count), `6,6` appears once. Based on previous examples (like Ex 2 `4,4`, `1,1` -> `4,1`), the pattern uses one unit per instance type in the cluster? Actually, in Example 3, `2,2` (Red) appeared twice and `3,3` (Green) once in the cluster, and the pattern was `2,2,3`.\n    *   Let's check the cluster in the test input:\n        *   Row 1: `...3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6...`\n        *   There are three `3,3` pairs and one `6,6` pair.\n        *   So the pattern is **`3,3,3,6`** (Green, Green, Green, Magenta).\n    *   **Turn/End Marker:** Found in the bottom-right cluster. `7,7` (Orange). Single marker value is **7**.\n\n2.  **Path Logic:**\n    *   Paths start at the **Start Markers** on the boundary.\n    *   They extend straight in the direction away from the border (Right).\n    *   They traverse the **Background** (9).\n    *   **Coloring:** The path follows the repeating pattern `3,3,3,6`.\n    *   **Turning/Stopping:**\n        *   The line continues until it is about to hit a **Wall** (Blob color 8) or the grid edge.\n        *   The pixel immediately before the wall becomes a **Turn Marker** (color 7), replacing the pattern color at that position.\n        *   At a Turn Marker, the path turns 90 degrees towards an **Open** direction (Background 9).\n        *   If multiple directions are open, it turns to the one that continues the logical flow (often determined by walls).\n        *   If the path hits the grid edge, it places an End Marker (7) and stops.\n\n3.  **Trace Path 1:**\n    *   **Start:** `(14, 0)` (Green/3).\n    *   **Segment 1 (Right):** Move East from `(14, 0)`.\n        *   Wall detected at `(14, 7)` (Value 8).\n        *   Path goes to `(14, 6)`.\n        *   Pattern: `3,3,3,6`.\n        *   Pixels `(14,0)` to `(14,5)` are `3,3,3,6,3,3`.\n        *   Pixel `(14,6)` is the Turn. Replaces next pattern value (3) with **7**.\n        *   **Turn:** At `(14, 6)`, South is blocked (Row 15 is 8s), North is open. Turn **North**.\n    *   **Segment 2 (Up):** Move North from `(14, 6)`.\n        *   Wall detected at `(5, 6)` (Value 8).\n        *   Path goes to `(6, 6)`.\n        *   Pattern resumes from where it left off (index 3 -> 6).\n        *   Sequence: `6,3,3,3...`.\n        *   Pixel `(6, 6)` is the Turn. Replaces pattern value with **7**.\n        *   **Turn:** At `(6, 6)`, North is blocked. West `(6, 5)` and East `(6, 7)` are open.

This gives the repeating pattern: **3,3,3,6**\n\n3. **Endpoint Marker**: The 7,7 block at rows 25-26, cols 24-25 serves as the endpoint marker.\n\n4. **Row Markers**: Single 3s at (14,0) and (26,0) indicate where to draw horizontal lines.\n\n**Applying the Transformation:**\n\n1. **Row 14 horizontal line**: The blob (9s) at cols 1-6, so fill cols 0-6 with pattern 3,3,3,6,3,3,3, then endpoint 7 at col 7.\n\n2. **Column 6 vertical line**: The blob starts at row 6 in this column. Place endpoint 7 at row 5, then pattern 3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3 from rows 6-14.\n\n3. **Row 26 horizontal line**: The blob (9s) at cols 1-10, so fill cols 0-10 with pattern 3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3, then endpoint 7 at col 11.\n\n4. **Column 10 vertical line**: The blob resumes at row 18 after a gap. Place endpoint 7 at row 17, then pattern 3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3 from rows 18-26.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,8,3,3,8,3,3,8,6,6,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8\n      9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,6,3,3,3,6,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- SELECT THE BEST RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1. It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
