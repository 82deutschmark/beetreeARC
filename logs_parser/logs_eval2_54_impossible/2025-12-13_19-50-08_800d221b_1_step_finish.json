I need to figure out the underlying logic. The grid sizes are the first thing I notice \u2013 16x16 in the examples, and a larger 30x30 test case. Colors are important, and I see distinct 'wall', 'background', and 'pattern' colors. My initial thought is to analyze the relationship between input and output, looking for changes in these colors and their positions.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis: Identifying the Pattern**\n\nIn Example 1, there's a clear 'wall' color (8, teal/light blue) that partitions the grid into regions. Inside these regions, I find repeating 'pattern' colors (3, 4) arranged in specific patterns. The output seems to alter the 'walls' and the regions they enclose.  The walls are either removed or changed, and the regions' content seem to propagate out. I'm focusing on connected regions \u2013 areas where the 'pattern' colors are touching each other, excluding walls and background. It's like a set of \"rooms\" with patterns inside and walls in between. I start by focusing on simple rectangular areas, tracing the lines of color 8.\n\n**Initial Hypothesis: Regional Expansion**\n\nMy first hypothesis is that the 'walls' take on the dominant color of the 'pattern' within their corresponding region. I start looking at coordinates and patterns, trying to identify rules for how the wall color changes. I see that the color of 8s is changed into the dominant color of the adjacent pixels.\n\n**Refining the Hypothesis: Majority Color and Edge Cases**\n\nAfter looking more carefully at Example 2, the 'walls' turn into the adjacent 'pattern' colors. I realize it is not the adjacent wall pixels that matter, but the internal pixels (dominant color). I now suspect it is a \"Majority Color\" rule: the 'walls' change to the most frequent color within the enclosed or adjacent 'pattern' region.\n\n**Testing the Theory and Dealing with Complex Regions**\n\nIn Example 3, 'walls' are separated by two different regions. I am now realizing that it works at the pixel level.  The \"conflict\" is solved at individual pixels within a wall. So now the wall does not change monolithically, it changes by the adjacent majority colors.\n\n**Algorithm Design and Edge Case Analysis**\n\nMy refined algorithm looks like this:\n\n1.  Identify the 'Background' color (usually the most common).\n2.  Identify the 'Wall' color (the lines separating regions).\n3.  Everything else is a 'Pattern'.\n4.  Find connected components of 'Pattern' colors.\n5.  Find connected components of 'Wall' pixels.\n6.  Match Wall components to Pattern components. The Wall changes to the Majority color.\n    A wall pixel belongs to a pattern group if it is next to a pattern pixel.\n\n**Applying the Algorithm to the Test Input**\n\nFor the test input (30x30), I quickly identify 'wall' color (4), then determine 'background' (6), and 'patterns' (3, 2). The goal now is to map 'wall' pixels to 'pattern' zones and apply the majority color rule. I go row by row and column by column and test whether they touch existing groups. I am seeing two main regions - one with 3, one with 2.\n\n**Test Case Analysis**\n\nNow, I analyze the 'wall' structure created by the color 4. I identify several connected components, including horizontal and vertical lines. I also start to analyze how each piece of this \"wall\" structure connects to the pattern regions. There are regions with a majority of 3 and regions with a majority of 2. I have a major \"conflict\" situation here - some 4s might touch both zones, and 4s need to become 2 or 3. It's becoming obvious that I have to examine each pixel very closely. I need to make sure each pixel becomes the right color in the end. I am assuming a 4-connectivity rule between wall pixels.\n\n**Final Solution**\nBased on this analysis, I will apply the logic of my algorithm to the specific grid structure. I am now working out the majority-propagation scheme for all the 'wall' pixels, taking into account any 'conflict' or ambiguous pixel locations. Now I will build my prediction.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by replacing the \"wall\" pixels with the dominant color of the adjacent pattern region.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Background Color:** 6 (Light Magenta/Pink). It fills the large empty areas.\n- **Wall Color:** 4 (Yellow). It forms the grid lines and boundaries.\n- **Pattern Regions:**\n    1.  **Top-Left Region (Rows 0-8, Cols 0-8):** Contains 3s (Green) and 2s (Red). The majority color is **3**.\n    2.  **Top-Right Small Region (Rows 3-6, Cols 26-29):** Enclosed by 4s. Contains 2s and 3s. The majority color is **2**.\n    3.  **Bottom-Right Region (Rows 21-29, Cols 15-29):** Contains 2s and 3s. The majority color is **2**.\n    4.  **Bottom-Left Region (Rows 22-25, Cols 0-2):** Contains 3s and 2s. The majority color is **3**.\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\n- Identify connected components of the wall (4s).\n- For each component (or part of a component), determine which Pattern Region it borders.\n- Change the color of the wall pixels to the majority color of that Pattern Region.\n- If a wall connects two different regions (e.g., the bar at Row 14 connecting Left-3 and Right-2), split the wall color based on proximity (left half becomes 3, right half becomes 2).\n- Isolated wall segments surrounded by background (6) that are part of a larger structure take the color of that structure.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n- **Top-Left Walls:** The horizontal line at Row 9 (Cols 0-9) and vertical line at Col 9 are adjacent to the 3-region. **Change 4 to 3.**\n- **Top-Right Enclosure:** The box at Cols 26-29 (Rows 3-6) encloses the 2-region. **Change 4 to 2.**\n- **Bottom-Right Walls:** The line at Row 20 (Cols 15-29) and vertical line at Col 14 are adjacent to the 2-region. **Change 4 to 2.**\n- **Bottom-Left Walls:** The vertical line at Col 2 and surroundings in Rows 21-25 enclose the 3-region. **Change 4 to 3.**\n- **Middle Connections:**\n    - Vertical line at Col 5 (Rows 10-13) connects to the Top-Left 3-system. **Change 4 to 3.**\n    - Vertical line at Col 12 (Rows 9-22) connects to the Bottom-Right 2-system. **Change 4 to 2.**\n    - Horizontal bar at Row 14 (Cols 9-14) connects the Left (3) and Right (2) systems. We split it: Left half (9,10,11) becomes **3**, Right half (12,13,14) becomes **2**.\n    - Horizontal bar at Row 16 (Cols 6-9) connects to Col 9 (3-system). **Change 4 to 3.**\n    - Vertical line at Col 6 (Rows 16-22) connects to the Bottom-Left 3-system. **Change 4 to 3.**\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n- **R0-8:** Wall at Col 9 becomes 3. Walls at Top-Right (C26-29) become 2. Vertical walls at C14, C22 become 2.\n- **R9:** C0-9 becomes 3. C12, C14 become 2.\n- **R10-13:** C5, C9 become 3.

My initial thought is, this seems like a pattern completion or image inpainting task. I have three examples and a test input to work from. Let's break down the examples.\n\n**Example 1** seems like a \"collage\" or \"repair\" job where there are some corrupted image patches with some clean blocks. The key is that it seems to use the clean blocks to fill in the corrupted areas. The walls between them are like separators or noise. From this, the strategy should be to identify a repeating pattern and replace the noisy elements with their pattern counterparts to inpaint the images.\n\nThen I look at **Example 2**, and it seems to reinforce the inpainting hypothesis, but this time with a cross-shaped separator. Again, it is important to replace the \"noise\" color and complete or tile the pattern.\n\n**Example 3** solidifies the need for the pattern completion. It is a very noisy image with walls, but the output is very clean and structured.\n\nThe **Test Input** has this repeating pattern and structure. It appears to be made up of tiles - a green tile and a red tile. The task is to \"complete\" the image across a horizontal boundary, which suggests pattern completion with a vertical split. The columns on the left contain green tiles, whereas the columns on the right are made of red tiles.\n\nSince there are only \"clean\" blocks in the image and some noisy \"walls\", let's identify the signal pattern to fill the gaps and make a full-sized clean image, using a periodicity of 9.\n\nSo my approach:\n1.  **Extract the clean green tile (TL) and red tile (BR).**\n2.  **Define a basic 9-pixel green pattern (G) from TL, and 9-pixel red pattern (R) from BR. I will handle the \"wall\" color 4 through modulo operations.**\n3.  **Create a 30x30 output image.**\n4.  **Fill the output image:**\n    *   Left side (cols 0-14): use the Green pattern $G$ and tile vertically.\n    *   Right side (cols 15-29): use the Red pattern $R$ and tile vertically.\n5.  **Use modulo 9 to ensure proper pattern continuity at each column.**\nThis should give a reasonably complete solution!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where the input grid contains \"clean\" pattern patches and large areas of \"noise\" or \"empty\" space (walls and background). We need to reconstruct the full image based on the available clean patterns.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n- **Example 1:** The input contains 4x4 patches of a specific texture (3s and 4s) in the corners. The rest of the grid is filled with noise (8s) and background (9s). The output preserves the clean patches and fills the noise/walls with the pattern, effectively inpainting the grid. The background (9s) is preserved.\n- **Example 2:** The input has regions separated by \"noise\" walls (5s). Some regions are empty (0s), some are filled with a pattern (1s and 2s). The solution propagates the pattern into the noise walls and empty regions where appropriate, respecting the boundaries.\n- **Test Input:** The grid is 30x30.\n    - There are \"walls\" of color 4 and 6 separating the grid.\n    - There is a clean patch of \"Green Pattern\" (colors 3 and 2, mostly 3) in the Top-Left (TL) corner (rows 0-8, cols 0-8).\n    - There is a clean patch of \"Red Pattern\" (colors 2 and 3, mostly 2) in the Bottom-Right (BR) corner (rows 21-29, cols 21-29).\n    - The rest of the grid is filled with noise (4s and 6s) or partially corrupted data (Bottom-Left).\n    - The grid structure implies a vertical split at column 15. The left side (cols 0-14) seems to correspond to the Green Pattern, and the right side (cols 15-29) to the Red Pattern.\n\n**Solution Logic:**\n1.  **Extract Patterns:**\n    - Extract the 9x9 Top-Left patch ($P_G$) from the input (rows 0-8, cols 0-8). This is the source for the Green Pattern.\n    - Extract the 9x9 Bottom-Right patch ($P_R$) from the input (rows 21-29, cols 21-29). This is the source for the Red Pattern.\n\n2.  **Define Filling Strategy:**\n    - The grid is treated as a tiling or periodic extension of these patches. The walls (index 9, 20) suggest a periodicity of roughly 10, or simply that the 9x9 pattern repeats. Given the seamless reconstruction in Example 1, we will tile the 9x9 patterns using modulo arithmetic.\n    - **Left Half (Cols 0-14):** Filled with the Green Pattern $P_G$.\n      - $Output(r, c) = P_G[r \\pmod 9, c \\pmod 9]$.\n    - **Right Half (Cols 15-29):** Filled with the Red Pattern $P_R$.\n      - To align the pattern correctly so that the source block at $(21, 21)$ is reproduced faithfully, we shift the coordinates.\n      - $Output(r, c) = P_R[(r - 21) \\pmod 9, (c - 21) \\pmod 9]$.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    - Iterate through every cell $(r, c)$ of the 30x30 output grid.\n    - If $c < 15$, use the pixel from $P_G$.\n    - If $c \\ge 15$, use the pixel from $P_R$.\n\n**Patterns:**\n$P_G$ (9x9):\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n```\n\n$P_R$ (9x9):\n```\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 1>\n<CANDIDATE 2>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333323333366666666666666666666\n332233333366666666666666662222\n223233333333333666666666662232\n233333333366663666666622222232\n333333233366663666666626662222\n223333323333363666666626666666\n333333333366363666666226666666\n333333333366363666666266666666\n666663666666363666662266666666\n666663633333444444442666666666\n666663336666444666666666666666\n666666666444444666666666666666\n666666666366362666666666666666\n666666666366362226666666666666\n666666333366366626666666666666\n666666366666366626666666666666\n666666366666366626666666666666\n666666366666366626666666666666\n666666366666362222222222222222\n333666366666362222222222222222\n333333366666332222222222222222\n323666666666662222222322222232\n323666666666662222232222222332\n333666666666662222222222222232\n666666666666662222222222322232\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify a pattern:\n1.

Boundaries at intersections are preserved.\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 2>\n<CANDIDATE 3>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333323333366666666666666666666\n332233333366666666666666662232\n223233333333333666666666662232\n233333333366663666666622222232\n333333233366663666666626662232\n223333323333363666666626666666\n333333333366363666666226666666\n333333333366363666666266666666\n666663666666363666662266666666\n666663633333333333322666666666\n666663336666334666666666666666\n666666666333342666666666666666\n666666666366462666666666666666\n666666666366262226666666666666\n666666333366266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666262222222222222222\n333666366666262222222222222222\n333333366666222222222222222222\n322666666666662222222322222232\n322666666666662222232222222332\n322666666666662222222222222232\n666666666666662222222222322232\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_2_step_1\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nAcross the examples, one color acts like a *corridor / boundary material* that must be \u201cclaimed\u201d by nearby *seed colors*:\n\n- There is a dominant **background** color that stays unchanged.\n- There is a special **fill/boundary** color (the one that changes in the output).\n- All remaining colors act as **seeds** that \u201cspread\u201d through the boundary color.\n\n**Rule: geodesic Voronoi fill on the boundary-color pixels**\n\n1. Identify the **background** = most frequent color in the grid (in the examples this is 9, 0, 8; in the test it is 6).\n2. Identify the **boundary/fill color** = the color that forms paths/frames between regions and is the one recolored in the outputs (in the examples: 8, 5, 7; in the test it is 4).\n3. The **seed colors** are all colors except `{background, boundary}` (in the test these are 2 and 3).\n4. Consider the graph made of only the **boundary-color cells** (4-connected adjacency).\n5.

For each corridor cell:\n   - if it is closer to source color 2 \u2192 recolor it **2**\n   - if it is closer to source color 3 \u2192 recolor it **3**\n   - if the distances tie \u2192 keep it as the original corridor color (**4**)  \n   (this produces the thin \u201cdivider line\u201d seen in the examples)\n\nAll non-corridor cells stay unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2  \n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2  \n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,3,2  \n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2  \n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n</CANDIDATE 3>\n<CANDIDATE 4>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333323333366666666666666666666\n332233333366666666666666662222\n223233333333333666666666662232\n233333333366663666666622222232\n333333233366663666666626662222\n223333323333363666666626666666\n333333333366363666666226666666\n333333333366363666666266666666\n666663666666363666662266666666\n666663633333333333322666666666\n666663336666334666666666666666\n666666666333342666666666666666\n666666666366462666666666666666\n666666666366262226666666666666\n666666333366266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666262222222222222222\n333666366666262222222222222222\n333333366666222222222222222222\n322666666666662222222322222232\n322666666666662222232222222332\n322666666666662222222222222232\n666666666666662222222222322232\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_1_step_1\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nAcross the examples, one color acts like a large \u201cbuffer/unknown\u201d region (Example1: `8`, Example2: `5`, Example3: `7`). That buffer is recolored by *spreading* the other (non-background) colors into it, like a Voronoi fill constrained to move only through the buffer cells.\n\nA precise way to reproduce the outputs:\n\n1. **Find the background color** = the most frequent color in the grid.  \n   This stays unchanged and does *not* spread.\n2. **Find the fillable/buffer color** = the second most frequent color in the grid.  \n   This is the only color that may change.\n3. Consider all remaining colors (everything except background and buffer) as **seed colors**. They stay fixed.\n4. For each cell of the **buffer color**, determine which seed color reaches it first by a **multi-source BFS** that:\n   - Moves in **4 directions** (up/down/left/right).\n   - Moves **only through buffer-color cells**.\n   - Starts from every buffer cell that is adjacent (4-neigh) to a seed cell, tagged with that seed\u2019s color.\n5. **Recolor** each buffer cell to the winning seed color.\n   - If two different seed colors reach a buffer cell at the **same minimum distance**, **leave it as the buffer color** (this creates the remaining buffer-color \u201cwatershed\u201d cells seen in the examples).\n6. All non-buffer cells remain unchanged.\n\nFor the test grid:\n- Background (most common) is `6`\n- Buffer (second most common) is `4`\n- Seed colors are `{2, 3}`\nSo we spread `2` and `3` into the `4`-cells, leaving `6`, `2`, `3` unchanged, and keeping `4` only on exact ties.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2  \n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2  \n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2  \n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2  \n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 4>\n<CANDIDATE 5>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333323333366666666666666666666\n332233333366666666666666666666\n223233333366666666666666666232\n233333333366666666666666666232\n333333233366666666666666666666\n223333323366666666666666666666\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333333333366666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666662222222222222222\n333666666666622222222222222222\n333333366666222222222222222222\n322666666666666222222322222232\n322666666666666222232222222332\n322666666666666222222222222232\n666666666666666222222222322232\n666666666666666222222222222222\n666666666666666222222222222222\n666666666666666222222222222222\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_3\">\n**My Solution Strategy for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out.  I've been given some examples, and my job is to come up with a rule to transform the input into the output.  It seems to be about identifying regions and filling them according to the pattern within those regions.  There's some kind of \"wall\" or \"separator\" color that is important to recognize.\n\n**Initial Exploration:**\n\nI started by looking at a 16x16 example, noticing that the grid was broken down into different colored regions separated by lines of a specific color (8).  I traced the colors to understand how they changed from input to output.  It seemed that some colors were just preserved, but the \"wall\" color (8) would get overwritten by an adjacent region's primary colors, like the pixels from neighboring regions. Then, I looked at a 10x10 example, where the wall color was 5. I noticed a clear cross shape of those 5s. In the outputs, the 5s were replaced. The regions seemed to be defined by that separator. I also saw that the output 5s were not always replaced, which made it confusing.\n\n**Refining the Idea:**\n\nThe initial idea was \"clean up\" the grid by removing the wall colors and letting the regions' \"patterns\" expand. It looked like some form of flood-fill, or connected components. The wall was a disruption. The key seemed to be making connected components and \"filling\" the walls with the dominant color in that area.\n\n**Connecting Components and the Main Pattern**\n\nI figured out that the problem seems to be an iterative pattern expansion:\n\n1.  Identify \"Wall,\" \"Background,\" and \"Pattern\" colors.\n2.  If it is a wall pixel, replace the wall pixels with the color of the adjacent pattern.\n\nBased on the examples, the walls were usually one pixel thick but could get a little noisy.\nThe main \"wall\" colors are:\n-   8 in example 1\n-   5 in example 2\n-   7 in example 3.\nI could find the non-wall pixels by identifying them using their color, or by finding the connected components of the \"wall\".\n\nI initially thought about the distance from the non-wall neighbors, but then realized it was simpler.\n\nThe rule:\n1.  **Define Wall color:** The color that visually outlines the regions.\n2.  **Define background color:** Large area covering other regions, for Ex 1.\n3.  **Iterate Through Wall Pixels**. For each wall pixel. find its neighboring pixels.\n4.  **Find the pattern pixels' color**: Choose the neighbor's color that is not a background or a wall.\n\nThis strategy helped me understand the transformation. This is what I applied to the test case, finding a 30 x 30 grid with 4 as wall. The logic was to let the background, Pattern colors overwrite wall color.\n\n**Validation**\n\nI double checked with the examples, and the test code.\n\nNow, I think I have it. I need to run this on the actual test input.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify the transformation rule from the solved examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs consist of regions of \"pattern\" colors (like 3, 2, 6) separated by \"wall\" or \"grid\" lines of a specific color (8 in Ex 1, 5 in Ex 2, 7 in Ex 3).\n2.  **Transformation:** The \"wall\" pixels are replaced by colors from the adjacent regions.\n3.  **Hierarchy/Priority:**\n    *   There appears to be a \"Background\" color in each example which is a solid, large area color (9 in Ex 1, 0 in Ex 2, 8 in Ex 3).\n    *   There are \"Pattern\" colors which are the distinct regions (3/4 in Ex 1, 1/2 in Ex 2, 6/5 in Ex 3).\n    *   **Rule:** Wall pixels are replaced by the adjacent **Pattern** color. If a wall separates a Pattern region and a Background region, the Pattern color expands into the wall. If a wall separates two Pattern regions, it likely takes the color of the nearest one. If a wall is surrounded only by Background, it becomes Background.\n    *   Specifically, in Example 1, the wall (8) between the noisy 3/4 region and the background 9 region becomes 3 (the dominant color of the noisy region). The wall between the background 9 and the 4 region becomes 4.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Roles:**\n    *   **Wall Color:** 4 (Forms horizontal and vertical lines separating regions).\n    *   **Background Color:** 6 (Occupies the large Top-Right and Middle areas, separating the distinct Top-Left and Bottom-Right regions).\n    *   **Pattern Colors:**\n        *   **3:** Dominates the Top-Left region (with some 2s mixed in).\n        *   **2:** Dominates the Bottom-Right region.\n        *   **3 & 2:** Small cluster in the Bottom-Left.\n\n2.  **Execution:** We iterate through the \"Wall\" pixels (4) and replace them based on connectivity:\n    *   **Top-Left Boundary:** The vertical wall at Column 9 (rows 0-9) and horizontal wall at Row 9 (cols 0-9) border the Top-Left 3-region.

The user wants me to crack an ARC task, given a few solved examples and a test input. I need to figure out the hidden logic behind the image transformations. Here's a breakdown of my thinking:\n\n1.  **Initial Scan & Feature Extraction:** First, I'm looking at the dimensions of the images, the values, and the colours. Quickly noting any obvious differences between the inputs and outputs (like the input and output sizes are the same). The main thing I'm noticing is the colour that seems to be acting as a \"separator\" or \"wall\" between other patterns and the images seem to be of the same size.\n2.  **Example 1 Deep Dive:** This is a 16x16 grid where one colour (I'll call it the *wall* colour, often number 8 in the first example) is the separator. Inside, a shape of one colour is present, with colours on either side. My intuition tells me that the \"wall\" colour is somehow being replaced or altered.\n    *   I looked at the shapes of the coloured blocks, their position relative to the \"wall\" and I'm seeing an obvious rule - the \"wall\" is being replaced, and what is *outside* the wall is, in some way, influencing the area. It looks like the wall colour is being removed and replaced by the neighbouring colours.\n    *   I'm verifying if it's based on repetition, pattern filling, or is it more like a slide or overlap?\n\n3.  **Example 2 Analysis:** I'm moving on to this new grid, it introduces a \"5\" wall, but its behaviour is slightly different in that the result isn't a simple removal of the \"wall\" colour. It seems the inner colours are propagating or moving over the barrier.\n    *   This is leading me to think in terms of a shape, with the wall colour being a boundary or occluding element, and the rest is being stitched together.\n    *   The 5's aren't removed, they're merged with the pattern, implying something more complex.\n\n4.  **Hypotheses Formation & Testing:**\n    *   **Hypothesis 1 (Folding/Unfolding):** My first instinct is about folding. The \"wall\" is a crease, and the image is bending along that crease. But the shape of the wall is irregular in Example 1, breaking the simple fold possibility.\n    *   **Hypothesis 2 (Sliding/Translation):** Could it be that components of the image are sliding past the wall and merging? The wall is a mask, and the rule is about how one side \"bumps\" into the other and mixes. This seems like a better match for example 2.\n        *   Example 3: the images is simpler, with 7 as the \"wall\" and the shapes on either side are simpler.\n        *   Then I checked - is it a Left-Right combination? Where does each piece shift?\n    *   **Hypothesis 3 (\"Pattern Propagation\"):** Is the rule about how patterns, if present, overwrite the \"wall\" colour. The examples 1 and 2 don't have clear patterns, but a mix, while example 3 seems to suggest a \"pattern\" propagation - from the left to the right side of the image. The Test input - 3s on the Left, 6 on the Right, with a 4-wall in between, strengthens this thought.\n\n5.  **Refining with Test Input:** This is where I'm applying the hypothesis to a new dataset, making sure my rule works in all situations.\n    *   Now the Test Input has a 4-wall, and the images on the Left and Right don't have easy-to-detect patterns.\n    *   I am focusing on how these coloured areas \"fill in\" the 4s using vertical propagation or, more frequently, *horizontal* propagation from each side.\n    *   I'm seeing that, the colour with a more clear *pattern* or the *colour* with the pattern propagates into the \"Wall\".\n\n6.  **\"Dominant\" Region Concept** After reviewing examples, the rule seems to depend on the \"dominance\" between the two regions (Left and Right).\n    *   What determines dominance? In most examples, 2, 3 have a clear *pattern*. Then I check the Examples: Example 1, 2 and 3.\n    *   If a patterned or complex region (3s and 2s) is next to 4, this zone wins (becomes 2 or 3).\n    *   Then I apply this concept to the test input.\n\n7.  **Finalize\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n1.  **Identify the \"Wall\"**: There is a specific color acting as a separator or \"wall\" (8 in Ex 1, 5 in Ex 2, 7 in Ex 3, and 4 in the Test Input). The goal is to replace this wall color with colors from the adjacent regions.\n2.  **Dominance Rule**: When the wall separates two regions, the color from the \"Dominant\" region floods into the wall.\n    *   **Pattern/Texture > Flat/Background**: Regions with complex patterns or specific details (like the mixed 3s and 4s in Ex 1, or 2s and 1s in Ex 2) are dominant over flat, uniform regions (like the 0s in Ex 2 or the 6s in Ex 3 and Test Input).\n    *   **Outer > Inner**: In Example 1, the outer patterned region overwrites the wall bordering the inner region.\n    *   **Vertical Propagation**: If horizontal neighbors don't resolve the fill (e.g., at a corner or horizontal bar of the wall), the dominant pattern propagates vertically (as seen in Ex 1, Row 4, and inferred for the Test Input).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Wall Color**: 4.\n*   **Regions**:\n    *   **Left Side (Rows 0-9)**: Contains 3s mixed with 2s (Textured/Dominant).\n    *   **Right Side (Rows 0-9)**: Contains 6s (Flat/Recessive).\n    *   **Middle (Rows 10-20)**: Mostly 6s on both sides.\n    *   **Bottom Left (Rows 21-29)**: Contains 3s and 2s (Textured/Dominant).\n    *   **Bottom Right (Rows 21-29)**: Contains 2s (Textured/Dominant) and 6s.\n\n**Transformation Steps:**\n*   **Rows 0-9**: The wall at column 9 separates the Dominant Left (3s) and Recessive Right (6s). The 3s propagate rightward, replacing the 4s.\n*   **Row 10**: The wall forms a horizontal bar. The Dominant 3s from the top propagate down to fill the 4s.\n*   **Rows 11-20**: The wall 4s are surrounded by 6s. They are filled with 6s.\n*   **Row 21**: The 4s on the left (`4,4,4`) are filled with 6s from the top (since the 6s above are the only neighbor, and 4s form a block). The 4s on the right (separating 6 and 2) are filled with 2s (Dominant).\n*   **Row 22**: The block of 4s on the left separates 3s (Left) and 6s (Right). 3s are dominant, so 4s -> 3s. On the right, 4s separate 6s and 2s. 2s are dominant -> 2s.\n*   **Rows 23-25**: Similar logic. 4s adjacent to 3s/2s become 3s/2s. Note in Row 25, the leftmost 4s fill from the top pattern (`3,2,2`).\n*   **Rows 26-29**: The 4s separating 6s and 2s are filled with 2s.\n\nOutput Grid:\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 6>\n<CANDIDATE 7>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333323333366666666666666666666\n332233333366666666666666662222\n223233333344442666666666662232\n233333333366662666666622222232\n333333233366662666666626662222\n223333323344462666666626666666\n333333333366262666666226666666\n333333333366262666666266666666\n666663666666262666662266666666\n666663644444444222222666666666\n666663346666222666666666666666\n666666666344444666666666666666\n666666666366262666666666666666\n666666666366262226666666666666\n666666333366266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666262222222222222222\n333666366666262222222222222222\n333333366666222222222222222222\n323666666666662222222322222232\n323666666666662222232222222332\n333666666666662222222222222232\n666666666666662222222222322232\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_3\">\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Identify the boundary/grid color** (forms lines separating regions): 8 in Ex1, 5 in Ex2, 7 in Ex3, **4 in test**\n2. **Identify the background color**: 9 in Ex1, 0 in Ex2, 8 in Ex3, **6 in test**\n3. **Identify source regions** (contain pattern colors): corners/edges with non-background, non-boundary colors\n4. **Find dominant color** in each source region\n5. **Transform**: Boundary lines extending from each source become that source's dominant color.

Let **seed colors** be all colors that are **neither background nor corridor**.\n4. **Propagate seed colors into the corridor** using shortest-path distance **moving only through corridor cells** (4-neighbor moves).\n   - For each corridor cell, compute the minimum corridor-path distance to each seed color (equivalently: multi-source BFS starting from all seed-colored cells, but only entering corridor cells).\n   - Replace that corridor cell with the seed color that reaches it with **strictly smaller** distance than all others.\n   - If there is a **tie** for smallest distance (two different seed colors reach it equally fast), **leave it as the corridor color**.\n\n### Applying to the test grid\n- Background is `6` (dominant).\n- Corridor/outline network is `4`.\n- Seed colors are `{2, 3}`.\n- Fill all `4` cells by corridor-distance to nearest `2` vs nearest `3`, keeping `4` only where distances tie.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 8>\n<CANDIDATE 9>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333323333366666666666666666666\n332233333366666666666666663333\n223233333333333666666666663232\n233333333366663666666633333232\n333333233366663666666636663333\n223333323333363666666636666666\n333333333366363666666336666666\n333333333366363666666366666666\n666663666666363666663366666666\n666663633333333333333666666666\n666663336666334666666666666666\n666666666333342666666666666666\n666666666366462666666666666666\n666666666366262226666666666666\n666666333366266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666262222222222222222\n333666366666262222222222222222\n333333366666222222222222222222\n323666666666662222222322222232\n323666666666662222232222222332\n333666666666662222222222222232\n666666666666662222222222322232\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_4_step_3\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nAcross the examples, one color acts as a **\u201cbridge/mask\u201d** that gets partially replaced by two other \u201cendpoint\u201d colors:\n\n- There is a **background** color that stays unchanged (e.g., 9 in ex.1, 0 in ex.2, 8 in ex.3).\n- There is a **bridge color** (ex.1: 8, ex.2: 5, ex.3: 7) that forms connected corridors/regions.\n- Exactly **two other non-background colors** exist; they behave like **competing sources** (ex.1: 3 & 4, ex.2: 1 & 2, ex.3: 6 & 5).\n- The task fills the bridge region by deciding, for each bridge cell, **which source is closer** via paths that stay inside the bridge color.\n\nA robust way to reproduce the example outputs is:\n\n1. **Identify background** = most common color.\n2. **Identify bridge** = the remaining color that gets changed (the \u201ccorridor\u201d color).\n3. The remaining two colors are the **source colors**.\n4. To avoid small noisy components influencing the fill (as seen in ex.2), use the **largest connected component** of each source color as the true source region.\n5. Consider the graph of cells of the bridge color (4-neighbor connections).\n6. For every bridge cell, compute:\n   - \\(d_A\\): shortest path length *through bridge cells only* to any bridge cell adjacent to the largest component of source color A.\n   - \\(d_B\\): same for source color B.\n7. Replace the bridge cell by:\n   - source color A if \\(d_A < d_B\\)\n   - source color B if \\(d_B < d_A\\)\n   - keep the bridge color if \\(d_A = d_B\\) (ties remain as the divider)\n\n### Applying to the test\n\n- Background is **6** (dominant).\n- Bridge color is **4**.\n- The two source colors are **3** and **2**.\n- Largest 3-component is the big cluster in the upper-left; largest 2-component is the big cluster in the lower-right.\n- Filling the connected 4-network by shortest-path distance produces almost all 4\u2019s turning into 3 on the \u201cupper/left\u201d side and into 2 on the \u201clower/right\u201d side, with a small tie line (remaining 4s) around the central meeting area.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,3,3,3,3\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 9>\n<CANDIDATE 10>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333323333366666666666666666666\n332233333366666666666666662222\n223233333322222666666666662232\n233333333366662666666622222232\n333333233366662666666626662222\n223333323322222666666626666666\n333333333366262666666226666666\n333333333366262666666266666666\n666663666666262666662266666666\n666663633333222222222666666666\n666663336666222666666666666666\n666666666333222666666666666666\n666666666366262666666666666666\n666666666366262226666666666666\n666666333366266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666262222222222222222\n333666366666262222222222222222\n333333366666222222222222222222\n323666666666662222222322222232\n323666666666662222232222222332\n333666666666662222222222222232\n666666666666662222222222322232\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n**Here's how I'm thinking about this task:**\n\nI've been asked to solve an ARC task, specifically one that involves pattern recognition and transformation on a grid. My first step is always to understand the core request. It's about figuring out the pattern within the input-output pairs and then applying that pattern to a new, unseen input.  The user's phrasing is a bit unusual; they're talking about avoiding a \"chain-of-thought\" and using words like \"maximal test-time reasoning.\"  My interpretation is this:  they want me to get to the answer, provide an explanation of my *reasoning*, but without showing every single little mental step or trail of investigation. That's a reasonable request, and I'll focus on delivering a clear, concise explanation of my *conclusions* about the pattern. I won't, as requested, show all the internal scratchwork or intermediate attempts that got me there, just the final, distilled logic.\n\nWith that in mind, I dove into the examples. I started by looking at the basic structure of the grids: their size, the colors used, and any obvious organizational patterns. The initial examples all seem to represent a map or a segmented region of space, with walls defining different areas. In these examples, the *walls* appear to be the element that changes, whereas the content inside the \"rooms\" is preserved or transformed in a consistent way.  I started by looking at the input, and then checking it against the output.  The main transformation appears to be that the walls take on the *color of the data pixels that were nearest to them.*\n\nI considered various hypotheses like symmetry, rotation, and even something more complex like in-painting or copying. After careful examination of all three provided examples, I have determined the algorithm's principle. It seems I am dealing with a kind of Voronoi diagram or region filling process. The core idea is that the \"wall\" pixels will change color to \"merge\" into the nearest *connected* region. The background pixels remain unchanged, and the areas containing data pixels act like \"seeds\". By observing all three provided examples, I could verify the algorithm with various data sets, background and wall colors, with a reasonable confidence to extrapolate to a new example.\n\nFor the new test case, I did this: I recognized which color represents the background, the walls, and the data. Then, I identified the main data regions (those areas where the \"real content\" resides). I then performed an operation: I considered that \"wall\" pixels near the data region should be assigned the color of the dominant color in that nearest region. The pattern is about the data regions controlling the color of the boundaries separating them.\n\nFrom this analysis, I could produce the output, by finding the appropriate boundary, and transforming the elements by determining their position (above or below the line), as well as a short logical explanation of how I did this, as requested.\n\nHere's the final output grid:\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n2,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6\n\nThe transformation rule involves a \"territorial propagation\" where wall structures (represented by color 4) absorb the identity of the nearest enclosed data region (colors 2 or 3).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Decomposition**: The grid is composed of a background field (6), data regions containing specific colors (2 and 3), and a skeletal wall structure (4).\n2.  **Pattern Identification**: In the examples, the \"wall\" pixels change color to match the dominant color of the adjacent data region. This creates a Voronoi-like partition where the walls are claimed by the nearest \"biome\".\n3.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    -   The input contains a Top-Left region and a small Bottom-Left region dominated by color **3**.\n    -   There is a large Bottom-Right region dominated by color **2**.\n    -   The wall structure (4) connects these regions.\n    -   By tracing the connectivity and distance, the walls separate into two domains.

My goal is to figure out the logic behind it, and that involves analyzing three example grids and then applying the pattern to a test input.  I'm given a bunch of instructions, but there's a slight contradiction: I'm told to both *not* reveal my chain of thought and *also* to explain my thinking! Usually, the \"explain your thinking\" part wins out, so that's what I'll do. Plus, it's what's needed for the task!\n\nFirst, I looked carefully at the examples, which are about painting/filling regions in a grid. Each grid has different \"wall\" colors that form the boundary between the regions, but the goal is to *remove* those \"wall\" colors based on the surrounding color(s) and expand the regions. \n\nI started by looking at the specific input and output. The background color stays the same. The \"wall\" color, also called \"separator color\" in my mind, is removed. I noticed that the colors inside the regions seem to \"spill\" out, but how does the color spread? Do neighboring colors influence each other? If so, what is the most common color in each region and how is the \"wall\" color affected?\n\nI formed this refined hypothesis: the \"walls\" (a specific color) of a grid are removed and replaced by the color *most* frequently found in the enclosed or adjacent region. The \"most frequent color\" thing is very important. I started looking at the border of the input region and also what is the background color. \n\nSo the algorithm is to 1) Find the \"background\" color, 2) Find the \"wall\"/\"separator\" color, 3) find the other \"pattern\" colors and their connected components (regions), 4) Find the *most* frequently found color (MFC) for each region, 5) Replace all separator color pixels with the associated MFC.\n\nI ran into some tricky bits: What happens if two regions are right next to each other, and which color will the wall \"take\"? This seemed like a more general problem, so I went back to the examples. Looking carefully at the examples, it looked like I had to account for these issues.\n\nI then started to apply a multi-source BFS (\"breadth-first search\") to propagate. This meant that the wall becomes the color of the regions that it touches. It doesn't actually remove the wall, but converts the wall to the most common color of each region. It also takes time.\nIn the output example, I saw the distance to the adjacent regions are accounted for and the conflict has no resolution.\n\nThen, there was a test input to work on. \n\nIn the test input, I found a 3-region and a 2-region. The walls connect the regions in a complex structure, so that's where I need to pay attention. I then focused on the separators. I thought about the meeting point. I then decided that the \"meeting point\" or equidistant points from the regions that had separators would not be colored.\n\nThe basic idea I came up with is if you know that each color is a source, then start from the start points and color any neighboring separator. I decided if a separator is a path between two colors, it's the point where the color merges.\n\nI tried to use a specific, careful process:\n1)  Copy the test input, 2) Identify the separator color 4, 3) Identify regions of each, 4) Calculate color.\nAfter many checks, I was ready to proceed. I have a clear plan.\nI will produce the output as follows:  Any 4s above the 15th row will be 3. The 4s in the 15th row will stay 4. The 4s below will be 2.\n\nAfter that, I made a few final checks and went back and looked at the test input more carefully to make sure there weren't any \"dangling\" parts of the structure that I missed. This kind of careful tracing is essential for getting the right answer!\n\nI have the output now, I'm ready to write it.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rule is a \"Voronoi-style propagation\" or \"in-painting\" of the separator grid lines (color 4) based on the connectivity to the colored pattern regions.\n\n1.  **Identify Components:**\n    *   **Background:** Color 6.\n    *   **Separator:** Color 4.\n    *   **Pattern Regions:**\n        *   **Top-Left / Bottom-Left:** Connected regions of color 3 (and some 2s mixed in). The dominant color is **3**. These regions are effectively a single \"source\" for color 3.\n        *   **Bottom-Right:** Connected region of color 2. The dominant color is **2**. This is the \"source\" for color 2.\n\n2.  **Propagation Rule:**\n    *   The separator pixels (4) form a connected graph (skeleton).\n    *   The skeleton is colored based on the graph distance to the nearest Pattern Region.\n    *   Pixels closer to the **3-region** become **3**.\n    *   Pixels closer to the **2-region** become **2**.\n    *   Pixels that are **equidistant** from both regions remain **4** (serving as a boundary/buffer).\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Source 3** enters the skeleton primarily at Row 9 (Top) and Row 22 (Bottom-Left).\n    *   **Source 2** enters the skeleton at Row 21/22 (Bottom-Right).\n    *   **Vertical Channel at Column 9:** Connects Top-3 to Bottom-Left-3. All pixels in this path become **3**.\n    *   **Vertical Channel at Column 12:** Connects Top-3 (via Row 9) to Bottom-Right-2 (via Row 21).\n        *   Calculated path lengths show the meeting point is at **Row 17**.\n        *   Rows 9\u201316 are closer to the Top -> Become **3**.\n        *   Row 17 is equidistant -> Remains **4**.\n        *   Rows 18\u201321 are closer to the Bottom -> Become **2**.\n    *   **Side Branches:**\n        *   Left-side structures (Col 6, Row 20-left, etc.) are connected to the 3-regions -> Become **3**.\n        *   Right-side structures (Col 14, Col 16, Row 20-right) are closer to the 2-region -> Become **2**. *Correction during trace: (15,14) is a dangling segment connected only to the top, so it becomes 3.*\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\nMost of the grid remains 6. The pattern regions (2s and 3s) remain unchanged. The network of 4s is replaced by 3s and 2s, except for the single equidistant pixel at **(17, 12)** which remains **4**.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,3,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 11>\n<CANDIDATE 12>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333323333366666666666666666666\n332233333366666666666666662222\n223233333333333666666666662232\n233333333366663666666622222232\n333333233366663666666626662222\n223333323333363666666626666666\n333333333366363666666226666666\n333333333366363666666266666666\n666663666666363666662266666666\n666663633333444222222666666666\n666663336666444666666666666666\n666666666333444666666666666666\n666666666366462666666666666666\n666666666366462226666666666666\n666666333366466626666666666666\n666666366666466626666666666666\n666666366666466626666666666666\n666666366666466626666666666666\n666666366666462222222222222222\n333666366666462222222222222222\n333333366666444222222322222232\n323666666666662222232222222332\n323666666666662222222222222232\n333666666666662222222222322232\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Border/Path Color**: In each example, there's a specific color forming paths/borders (8 in Ex1, 5 in Ex2, 7 in Ex3).

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_7_step_5_image\">\nOkay, here\u2019s my thought process on this ARC task. The user wants me to figure out a rule for transforming grid images, based on examples with a similar network structure but different colors.\n\n**Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown:**\n\nI need to analyze a few examples where a \u2018network\u2019 (like lines or a cross shape) of one color connects to rectangular \u2018terminator\u2019 regions of other colors. The task is to determine how the network color changes in the output grid, based on the colors in the terminator regions.\n\n**Example Analysis and Pattern Recognition:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**  A cyan network connects to regions of green/yellow. The cyan network changes to green or yellow based on the dominant colors of the connecting terminator regions. Importantly, there\u2019s a junction where the lines meet that seems to preserve the original color or take on a mix.\n*   **Example 2:** A grey network connects to red/blue blocks. The network changes to red or blue based on the terminator. This helps to confirm the general process.\n*   **Example 3:**  An orange network connects to magenta/grey blocks. This follows the same dominant color rule. It also suggests that the original network color is preserved at junction points.\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation:**\n\nMy hypothesis is that the network color propagates outward from the terminator regions to the junction, taking on the dominant color of the terminator.  Junctions will need a special rule to either preserve the original color or reflect the conflicting inputs.\n\n**Refinement of Logic:**\n\nI need to precisely define the \u2018dominant\u2019 color (most frequent). I will also need to formalize the junction behavior, maybe using a Voronoi diagram or a distance-based method.\n*   **Voronoi and Distance:** Using distance from the terminator, nodes that can be reached by only one color, take that color. Nodes where distances from multiple colors match, remain the original skeleton color.\n\n**Algorithm Design and Test Input Focus:**\n\nThe test input has a background, a \u2018network\u2019 color (let\u2019s assume it is 4), and some \u2018objects\u2019 of mixed colors.\n\n1.  **Parse and Identify:** Define the background, skeleton (network), and object colors.\n2.  **Network and Source Identification:** Find the connected component of network (4) and identify the areas connected to the colored block (\u2018Source regions\u2019).\n3.  **Flood Fill/Propagate Colors:**  Use a flood-fill from each source region, with the target color.\n4.  **Conflicts, Boundaries, Junctions:**\n    -Where the colors meet, and the distances are equal, treat that as a \u2018junction\u2019 or boundary. These nodes retain the original network color.\n    -Refine the color.\n\n**Applying the Hypothesis to the Test Input:**\n\nI will look at the exact locations of the network connections (the 4s) to the blocks of colors (3 and 2) in the test input. There will be one on the left, one on the right, and the colors will propagate. The center will be the vertical spine. The colors will meet in the middle and the spine remains a boundary.\n\n**Refinement and Grid-Based Implementation**\n\nI will now generate the output grid.\n*   The Vertical line at 12-14.\n*   From observation, anything to the left of column 12 becomes 3.\n*   From observation, anything to the right of column 14 becomes 2.\n*   Keep the center 12-14 skeleton as is.\n*   There's also some small rule.\n\nFinal Test is, if I apply it as so:\n- `3`: Left side\n- `2`: Right Side\n- `4`: Stay as is.\n\nIt will produce the result grid.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided examples and the test input, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify the Components:**\n    *   **Background:** The dominant filler color (e.g., `9` in Ex 1, `0` in Ex 2, `8` in Ex 3). In the Test Input, the background is `6` (Magenta).\n    *   **Skeleton/Network:** A connected structure of lines of a specific color (e.g., `8` in Ex 1, `5` in Ex 2, `7` in Ex 3). In the Test Input, the skeleton is `4` (Yellow).\n    *   **Colored Blocks/Terminals:** Regions of other colors that touch the skeleton. These serve as \"sources\" for the new colors. In the Test Input, there are regions of `3` (Green) and `2` (Red).\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic (Color Propagation):**\n    *   The skeleton pixels change color based on the \"Colored Block\" they are connected to.\n    *   **Source Identification:**\n        *   The **Left side** of the grid contains large blocks of **Green (3)** pixels touching the skeleton.\n        *   The **Right side** of the grid contains large blocks of **Red (2)** pixels touching the skeleton.\n    *   **Propagation Rule:**\n        *   Skeleton pixels (`4`) that are part of the branches leading to the Green (`3`) blocks become **Green (`3`)**.\n        *   Skeleton pixels (`4`) that are part of the branches leading to the Red (`2`) blocks become **Red (`2`)**.\n    *   **Junction/Spine Preservation:**\n        *   Where the branches from different colored sources meet (the \"center\" or \"spine\" of the network), the skeleton color is **preserved**.\n        *   In the Test Input, the skeleton forms a central vertical \"ladder\" or spine roughly between columns 12 and 14.\n        *   Branches extending to the left (Column < 12) turn `3`.\n        *   Branches extending to the right (Column > 14) turn `2`.\n        *   The central vertical structure (Columns 12, 13, 14) remains `4`.\n\n3.  **Applying to Test Input:**\n    *   Iterate through the grid.\n    *   If a pixel is `4` (Skeleton):\n        *   If it is in the **Left** region (Column index < 12): Change to `3`.\n        *   If it is in the **Right** region (Column index > 14): Change to `2`.\n        *   If it is in the **Center** region (Column index 12, 13, 14): Keep as `4`.\n    *   All other pixels (Background `6`, Blocks `2`, `3`) remain unchanged.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n\n*   **Left Region (Cols 0-11):** All `4`s become `3`.\n*   **Center Region (Cols 12-14):** All `4`s stay `4`.\n*   **Right Region (Cols 15-29):** All `4`s become `2`.\n\nThis effectively colors the left tributaries green, the right tributaries red, and keeps the central main artery yellow.\n\noutput:\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,4,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_8_step_5_image\">\n**Problem Understanding and Initial Approach:**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this ARC problem. The task seems to involve grids where we need to figure out how colored pipes connect and transform based on surrounding regions. My first impression is that there's a recurring pattern: a network of pipes, usually in a single color, leading to rectangular regions that are filled with patterns of other colors.\n\n**Early Observations and Analyses:**\n\nLooking at the examples, I can see that the pipe color seems to change and take on a dominant color from the regions it connects to. There's usually a junction point where the pipes meet. Analyzing Example 1 helps a lot: We've got a maroon background and teal (8) pipes connecting to regions with a checkerboard of green (3) and yellow (4). In the output, those pipes change colors to reflect what those regions seem to contain the most of. The top-left region's pipes turned green, the top-right and bottom-left turned yellow. It appears the color change is related to the regions' color composition.\n\n**Developing a Rule and Testing It:**\n\nI'm thinking the main logic has to do with identifying the network, the background, and those connected regions, and then seeing how the pipe color is determined by the regions. The rule seems to be: The pipe gets the color of the most frequent non-background pixel type in the connected region, but how about the pixels right at the intersection? I noticed in Example 1, the pipes meet at a central point. I'm going to have to make sure to account for that.\n\n**Refining the Rule:**\n\nI have to pinpoint the rule, how a pipe pixel gets \"connected\" and how to find this dominant or characteristic color. The flooding, I am considering this approach to identify the boundaries where different parts of the network meet. Example 2's structure made things much clearer. Identifying the regions and their associated colors, and then \"flooding\" out along the pipe network using the majority color of the region it connects to. Where there is overlap, those pixels should retain the original pipe color.\n\n**Edge Cases and Test Input Analysis:**\n\nThe examples are helpful, but the test input looks a bit different. My plan is to start by identifying what are the \"pipes\" and the \"background\". I saw a pattern of yellow (4) lines connecting to clusters of red (2) and green (3) pixels. The background is a magenta (6). So now I'm thinking, are the pipe segments connected? Are they split up?\n\n**Developing the Test Input Solution:**\n\nI'm getting closer, so I figured, maybe the yellow lines are not a continuous network, or maybe that the 4 value is only the structure boundary. In the examples, there's always one big structure. Since the grid width is even, the logic needs to address this, and I'm guessing the key to solving this is going to rely on a symmetry or proximity to the borders of the grid: the boundary pixels.\n\n**Finalized Solution:**\n\nOkay, I believe I've got it. I decided that, for the test input, the best way to handle the test input is to categorize all yellow pixels (4s) as the pipe system. Since the problem is symmetric, I can decide which half of the pipe structure gets which color.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n1. Identify connected yellow (4) pixels.\n2. If the 4 is mostly on the left, it should turn green(3). If the 4 is mostly on the right, it should turn red(2).\n3. The key is now: how to deal with the middle part that touches both halves? The way that the examples set up their structures showed that the touching points must stay yellow. This means: If a pixel is in a connecting zone, then it stays yellow.\n\nTo implement this: I can just check the column position. If the column is less than the center index, set to 3. If greater than, set to 2. If equal, keep as 4. Now, I have solved it!\n\n\nThe goal of this task is to simulate a \"fluid propagation\" or \"network coloring\" process. \n\n**Logic Discovery:**\n1.  **Identify Components:**\n    *   **Background:** The most frequent color in the grid (e.g., Maroon in Ex 1, Black in Ex 2, Light Blue in Ex 3, Magenta/6 in Test).\n    *   **Pipes:** A network of pixels of a single distinct color (e.g., Teal in Ex 1, Grey in Ex 2, Orange in Ex 3, Yellow/4 in Test) that connects different parts of the grid.\n    *   **Regions:** Clumps of non-background, non-pipe pixels located at the endpoints or corners of the pipe network. These regions have specific colors (e.g., Green/Yellow in Ex 1, Blue/Red in Ex 2).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   The pipe network transports the color of the connected regions.\n    *   **Source:** Each region acts as a source of its dominant color.\n    *   **Propagation:** The color flows from the region into the connected pipe pixels.\n    *   **Junctions:** Where flows from different colored regions meet, they stop. The pipe pixels at the interface (or the geometric center of the junction) retain their original color to serve as a buffer or mixing point.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Analysis of Test Grid:**\n    *   **Background:** 6 (Magenta).\n    *   **Pipes:** 4 (Yellow).\n    *   **Regions:**\n        *   **Top-Left Quadrant:** Contains a large region of 3s (Green).\n        *   **Bottom-Left Quadrant:** Contains a region of 3s (Green) mixed with some 2s, but dominantly Green in the connected main structure.\n        *   **Top-Right Quadrant:** Contains a region of 2s (Red).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Quadrant:** Contains a region of 2s (Red).\n    *   **Structure:** The pipe network consists of disconnected or loosely connected structures dominating the left and right sides, with a central connection point.\n        *   The pipes on the **Left** side (Columns 0-14) connect to the Green (3) regions.\n        *   The pipes on the **Right** side (Columns 16-29) connect to the Red (2) regions.\n        *   There is a **Bridge** in the center (Row 15, Columns 14-16) consisting of `4, 4, 4`.\n\n2.  **Execution:**\n    *   All pipe pixels (`4`) located in the left half of the grid (Columns < 15) turn **Green (3)**.\n    *   All pipe pixels (`4`) located in the right half of the grid (Columns > 15) turn **Red (2)**.\n    *   The pipe pixels exactly in the middle or forming the junction buffer must remain **Yellow (4)** to prevent the two colors from touching (following the pattern in Example 2 where the junction color separates the branches).\n    *   Specifically, at the bridge on Row 15:\n        *   (15, 14) is on the left -> becomes 3.\n        *   (15, 16) is on the right -> becomes 2.\n        *   (15, 15) is the buffer -> stays 4.\n\n3.  **Result:**\n    *   The yellow lattice on the left turns green.\n    *   The yellow lattice on the right turns red.\n    *   The central-most yellow pixels (column 15) remain yellow.\n\nOutput Grid Calculation:\nReplacing 4s with 3s where column index < 15.\nReplacing 4s with 2s where column index > 15.\nLeaving 4s as 4 where column index == 15.\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,3,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

The hints are crucial: only the maze-like structure changes, it's recolored with two existing colors, and there's a small central junction that stays the original corridor color.\n\nI'm starting by analyzing the examples. Example 1 seems to have a path that links differently colored blocks or \"rooms\".  It looks like the corridor is a gradient \u2013 parts near one block take that block's color. There's a \"meeting point\" in the middle of the corridor where the new colors meet. The key seems to be the color adjacency to the corridor.\n\nExample 2 reinforces this. The corridor gets colored based on the colors \"at its ends,\" with the meeting point staying the original color.\n\nExample 3 is a bit tricky since the colors are less distinct and adjacency is less obvious. It's becoming clearer that the corridor always has two endpoints and is connected to other things via a \"gate\".\n\nMy hypothesis is crystallizing: Identify the \"maze\" or \"path\" color. Determine the two \"target\" colors \u2013 usually the dominant colors of the separate grid regions. Find where the \"path\" touches or is close to the \"target\" colors. Use those as \"seed points\" for a flood fill from both target colors. The meeting point (where the \"waves\" collide) stays the original path color. It seems the key is to calculate distances. This distance approach is what allows us to identify the \"meeting point\" in the corridor. We have to be mindful that the connection isn't always direct, and we need to account for possible 1-cell gaps or \"gates\" that act as access points.\n\nThe test input seems to confirm this approach. I see a similar grid structure, with distinct colored regions and a path connecting them. It seems I can \"visualize\" a multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the ends of the corridor and propagating the colors from the respective regions, and applying the distance check is essential to create that tiny region where the original \"path\" color remains. In fact, if the distance to both starting colors is roughly the same, that's where the original color will remain.\n\nNow I have a step-by-step algorithm: Identify the path color, Identify the two fill colors, Find seed points (adjacent cells or \"entrances\" to regions), BFS with color propagation and the key \"distance-based junction\" logic. If the distance from one seed is lower than the other, give that cell that color. If it is within 1 cell, or at equal distance, keep the cell the original maze color.\n\nI need to apply this to the test input by carefully calculating the geodesic distances of each path cell to the two seed color zones. The crucial operation is a BFS from the source cell. It is key to make sure I don't overlook any hidden adjacent structures. Then, by applying the distance logic, and outputting the \"final\" coloring I should solve the problem!\n\n\nTo solve this task, I need to identify the \"corridor\" structure in the grid, determine which two colors it should be recolored into, and find the meeting point where the original color remains.\n\n**1. Analysis of Input:**\n- **Corridor Color:** The integer `4` (yellow) forms a complex, connected structure (a maze or corridor) running through the grid.\n- **Background/Walls:** The integers `6` (magenta) form large blocks acting as walls.\n- **Region Colors:**\n    - The **Top-Left** region contains a mix of `3` (green) and `2` (red), but the `4`-corridor in this area (specifically the vertical shaft at column 9) is directly adjacent to `3`s.\n    - The **Bottom-Right** region also contains `3` and `2`, but the `4`-corridor in this area (specifically the vertical shaft at column 14, rows 21-29) is directly adjacent to `2`s.\n    - Additionally, a `4`-segment at `(4, 26)` in the top-right touches a `2`.\n- **Logic:** The corridor connects a \"Green (3) Domain\" to a \"Red (2) Domain\". The corridor should be flood-filled with `3` from the green side and `2` from the red side. The cells where these two floods meet (are equidistant or nearly equidistant) will remain `4`.\n\n**2. Transformation Logic (Mental Simulation):**\n- **Source 3:** The top part of the corridor (column 9, and the bridge on row 4) is connected to the `3`s. These areas and their downstream paths will turn to `3`.\n- **Source 2:** The bottom-right parts of the corridor (column 14 lower half, column 21/26 areas) are connected to the `2`s. These will turn to `2`.\n- **Meeting Point:**\n    - Tracing the distances:\n        - The \"3\" flood comes down column 9, across the row 7 bridge to column 12, down column 12, and across the row 11 bridge to column 14.\n        - The \"2\" flood comes up column 14 from the bottom.\n        - Another \"2\" flood comes from the right side (row 10) towards column 14.\n    - The meeting point is around **Row 10, Column 14**.\n    - Calculating geodesic distances (D3 for distance from green source, D2 for distance from red source):\n        - At `(10, 14)`: D3 $\\approx$ 10, D2 $\\approx$ 11.

My initial impression is that it involves transforming a grid of numbers, which I'm assuming are colors, into a new grid, all while following some pretty specific rules.  I've got a detailed thought process to ensure I understand these rules.\n\nFirst, I need to get a handle on what the input and output look like. The input is a grid of integers, which I'm taking to be colors, and the output is a modified version of the same grid. I'm also dealing with several hints. The key constraint is that I need to provide a complete, final grid, along with my thinking process.\n\nLooking at the hints, there's a recurring pattern: a \"corridor\" is the thing that's going to get edited. This corridor is made of a single connected component of a specific color and always touches a few differently colored regions. I need to keep the \"corners\" of the grid untouched, and the corridor is being recolored using only *two* colors that are already present in the input. Also, this recoloring forms continuous segments.\n\nAlright, let's dive into Example 1. It is a 16x16 grid with three colors: green, yellow, azure, and maroon. The top-left, top-right, and bottom-right corners, are all 3/4 (green/yellow), and the bottom-left is mainly 9 (maroon). The background is 9 or 8. The \"corridor\" here is a maze made of color 8 (azure). It connects these corner areas. In the output, the corners are largely the same. The corridor, color 8, is now colored with green and yellow, colors 3 and 4. Specifically, the corridor pixels connected to the top-left section turn green, the ones attached to the top-right become yellow, and the bottom section also becomes yellow. The hint says there's a \"junction\" of the original corridor color, which is 8, remaining in the middle. So, a small chunk of azure 8s stays put. My hunch is the corridor works as a bridge between separate \"sources,\" and each source has its characteristic color. I suspect the corridor gets filled with the color it touches until meeting at a junction that retains its original color.\n\nNow, let's move to Example 2. It is a 10x10 grid with four colors: black (0), gray (5), red (2), blue (1). The background is black, the top-right is red, and the lower-left is a mix of red and blue. The corridor is gray (5). It connects the red top-right section to the lower-left. In the output, the corridor is a mix of red and blue, depending on where it connects. It's clear that the gray corridor gets filled with red (2) and blue (1).  Now I check and see that the output coloring corresponds to the initial color of the region. The part linked to the red top-right becomes red, and the gray parts connected to the blue/red mix become blue, but there's a section of gray in the middle where everything crosses. My theory now is: a corridor connecting different \"source\" regions.\n\nLet's dissect Example 3. Here, there are magenta (6), orange (7), azure (8), and gray (5) colors.  The \"corridor\" is orange. There are large azure blocks, and blocks of magenta, and the orange corridor winds around. Let's look at the output. In the output, the corridor (orange) color is gone and replaced by magenta (6) and gray (5). I'm guessing the \"corridor\" is color 7, given the hint from the previous two examples. The path connected to the 6-region becomes 6. The one touching 5/6 becomes 5. This solidifies the \"two colors\" pattern.\n\nAfter analyzing these three examples, I've got some rules forming:\n1.  **Corridor:** I've got to find the connected component (a specific color) that connects distinct regions.\n2.  **Regions:** The corridor must touch different regions (groups of other colors).\n3.  **Colors:** Each region has a \"fill color\". The two active colors in the puzzle are present in these regions. The corridor is filled with the color from the region it connects. If multiple colors are present, there seems to be a predominant fill color, for example, the majority is the fill color. The central junction is left untouched.\n\nSo, in Example 1, the corridor is 8, and the regions have 3/4.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid by recoloring a specific \"corridor\" component. Based on the solved examples, the rules are:\n1.  **Identify the Corridor:** The corridor is the large, connected component of a specific color (distinct from the background and the large corner regions). In the test input, the background is 6 (magenta) and the corridor is 4 (yellow).\n2.  **Identify Sources:** The corridor connects two or more regions of different colors. We need to identify these colors.\n    *   **Top-Left Region:** A large block consisting mainly of 3s (green) with some 2s. The corridor touches this region at the top-left (e.g., Row 9, Cols 0-8). Thus, one fill color is **3**.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Region:** A large block consisting mainly of 2s (red) with some 3s. The corridor touches this region at the bottom-right (e.g., Cols 14, Row 22+). Thus, the second fill color is **2**.\n3.  **Recolor based on Proximity (Flood Fill):** The corridor should be filled with the color of the region it is closest to (graph distance).\n    *   The \"3\" color floods from the Top-Left connection.\n    *   The \"2\" color floods from the Bottom-Right connection (and effectively the Bottom-Left connection as well, which is closer to the \"2\" source in the corridor topology).\n4.  **Preserve Junction:** The boundary where the two flood fills meet should remain the original corridor color (4).\n\n**Tracing the Path and Junction:**\n*   **Path from Top-Left (3):** Enters at Row 0-9, Col 9. It flows down Col 9 to Row 11.\n*   **Path from Bottom-Right (2):** Enters at the bottom (Col 14). Flows up Col 14 to Row 12, then connects to Row 11 via Col 12.\n*   **The Meeting Point:** The two paths converge at the horizontal segment on **Row 11**.\n    *   The \"3\" flow reaches (11, 9).\n    *   The \"2\" flow reaches (11, 12).\n    *   The pixels between them are (11, 10) and (11, 11).\n    *   Calculating distances:\n        *   (11, 9) is adjacent to the Top source path.\n        *   (11, 12) is adjacent to the Bottom source path.\n        *   (11, 10) and (11, 11) are the equidistant midpoint.\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   All 4s \"upstream\" of (11, 10) become **3**. This includes the top vertical segment and the left part of Row 11.\n    *   All 4s \"downstream\" of (11, 11) become **2**.

A background color (9 in Ex1, 0 in Ex2, 8 in Ex3 \u2192 **6** in test)\n   - A corridor color forming a maze structure (8 in Ex1, 5 in Ex2, 7 in Ex3 \u2192 **4** in test)\n   - Two region colors in corner blocks (3,4 in Ex1; 1,2 in Ex2; 5,6 in Ex3 \u2192 **3,2** in test)\n\n2. **The transformation**:\n   - The corridor gets recolored based on which region it connects to\n   - Corridors connecting to the top-left region (color 3) become 3\n   - Corridors connecting to the bottom-right region (color 2) become 2\n   - A small central junction (3\u00d73 area) remains in the original corridor color (4), except the center cell which takes a region color\n\n3. **For the test input**:\n   - Top-left region (rows 0-8, cols 0-8): mostly 3s\n   - Bottom-right region (rows 21-29, cols 15-29): mostly 2s\n   - The junction is at rows 11-13, cols 12-14\n   - Small corner regions (top-right with 2,3 pattern, bottom-left with 3,2 pattern) maintain their internal values\n\n4. **Determining connectivity**:\n   - Corridors above/left of junction \u2192 connected to 3 region \u2192 become 3\n   - Corridors below/right of junction \u2192 connected to 2 region \u2192 become 2\n   - Junction outer ring stays 4, center becomes 3\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,3,3,3,3\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 21>\n<CANDIDATE 22>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333323333366666666666666666666\n332233333366666666666666662222\n223233333333333666666666662232\n233333333366663666666622222232\n333333233366663666666626662222\n223333323333363666666626666666\n333333333366363666666226666666\n333333333366363666666266666666\n666663666666363666662266666666\n666663633333444222222666666666\n666663336666424666666666666666\n666666666222444666666666666666\n666666666266262666666666666666\n666666666266262226666666666666\n666666222266266626666666666666\n666666266666266626666666666666\n666666266666266626666666666666\n666666266666266626666666666666\n666666266666262222222222222222\n222666266666262222222222222222\n332222266666222222222222222222\n322666666666662222222322222232\n322666666666662222232222222332\n222666666666662222222222222232\n666666666666662222222222322232\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n### Inferred rule (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Identify the \u201ccorridor/maze\u201d color**: it is the single large connected component that is *not* the background and is the only structure that changes.  \n   - In the test grid, the dominant background is **6**.  \n   - The large connected maze component is **4**.  \n   - The only other (non-background) colors are **2** and **3** \u2192 these are the **two recoloring colors**.\n\n2. **Find the unique solid 3\u00d73 block of corridor color** (all 9 cells are the corridor color).  \n   This is the \u201ccentral junction.\u201d  \n   - In the test input, the 3\u00d73 all-4 block is at **rows 12\u201314 and columns 13\u201315** (1-based indexing).\n\n3. **Preserve the junction boundary**:\n   - Keep the **8 perimeter cells** of that 3\u00d73 block as the original corridor color (**4**).\n   - Recolor the **center cell** of the 3\u00d73 block to the **majority** of the two recoloring colors (2 vs 3).  \n     Here, **2** is clearly more frequent overall \u2192 the center becomes **2**.\n\n4. **Recolor the rest of the corridor (all other 4-cells)**:\n   - Treat the preserved 3\u00d73 perimeter as a separator and flood-fill the remaining corridor.  \n   - The corridor splits into two sides:  \n     - The side connected to the **top-left region** (mostly **3**) becomes **3**.  \n     - The other side becomes **2**.\n\nAll non-corridor cells stay unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,2,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 22>\n<CANDIDATE 23>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333323333366666666666666666666\n332233333366666666666666662222\n223233333333333666666666662232\n233333333366663666666622222232\n333333233366663666666626662222\n223333323333363666666626666666\n333333333366363666666226666666\n333333333366363666666266666666\n666663666666363666662266666666\n666663633333444222222666666666\n666663336666424666666666666666\n666666666333444666666666666666\n666666666366262666666666666666\n666666666366262226666666666666\n666666333366266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666266626666666666666\n666666366666262222222222222222\n333666366666262222222222222222\n333333366666222222222222222222\n323666666666662222222322222232\n323666666666662222232222222332\n333666666666662222222222222232\n666666666666662222222222322232\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Identify the background color** as the most frequent value in the grid.\n2. **Identify the \u201ccorridor/maze\u201d color** as the single large connected component that is edited (in all examples, exactly one non-background color forms this big connected maze).\n3.

Let's dig in. I need to figure out the underlying logic from the examples and test it.\n\n*   **Example 1 Analysis:** I'm seeing a grid-like structure with a maroon background (`9`), and what I initially assumed was the background. But the description talks about a \"Lattice\" \u2013 orthogonal lines. The input has regions (`3` and `4`) separated by lines (`8`). Ah, so `9` is the \"interior fill\" with noise (`3` and `4`). The lattice is color `8`. It looks like the lattice lines divide the image into compartments, and the outputs transform the lattice colors depending on adjacent regions. I need to map the \"dominant\" colors.\n\n    The \"Transformation Description\" gives a clue, too: detect lattice, label colors, assign labels to the compartments. Then, recolor the lattice. Ah, in example one, the vertical line (col 4) is between a mix of 3,4 and a main 9-region. The horizontal line (row 4) is between these 3-4 mix and 9. It seems like the line color changes to be \"non-9\" label, if it is \"non-9\" on either sides. So it is becoming `3` and `4`. So the lattice is `8`, and the rule is to replace the lattice with the \"non-background\" label of the adjacent compartments.\n\n    I need to think about the compartments. I see that the original lattice lines are a little blurred. The lattice color seems to change. Horizontal at rows 4 and 8. Vertical at col 4, and col 11. It's not a perfectly uniform lattice. Also, the description suggests the lattice can be \"segmented\". So the `8` is key.\n\n    Also, it becomes the \"noise\" or \"dominant\" compartment label (interior fill).\n\n*   **Example 2 Analysis:** Now, I move to Ex 2. This has a background `0`, lattice `5`, and label colors `1` and `2`. Here, the lattice `5` seems straightforward, creating different rectangular compartments. But there is a line `5`, but it seems that some `5`s are in the compartments too, so the compartments are not all rectangular? I must remember what does \"segmented\" mean. The Transformation hints: \"Recolor the lattice... keep where two labels\". So I need to verify that is the logic. In Example 2 output, lines (col 7 and row 3) change into labels.\n\n    So, here the vertical line at col 7 (rows 0-2) splits an Empty and Label `2` (the output becomes `2`). Also, vertical line at col 7 (4-6) has no clear changes, since that region is `0`. Horizontal lines are at row 3 (cols 4-9) that contains a label (`2`) and empty. The output shows `0`s (empty). That is correct! Then row 7 (0-2) and (8-9). Below is 1, so lattice becomes `1`. Also what is going on at C4 (rows 4-6, cols 0-2), there are 5s? Output says 1s! And that is because adjacent region 7 is 1?\n\n    Also, the description of \"segmented lattice lines\". If \"noise\" occurs within the compartment, it should be still considered part of lattice. Output becomes all the non-background, `1`, and other area `0`. So to recap, if I look at line segments, and its neighborhoods, each line color is based on the region \"noise\" to the side of the lines, if the neighborhoods are the same or the only noise. However, it seems like some are empty, then it takes the color to the \"labeled area\", so that is correct.\n\n*   **Example 3 and Test Input Analysis:** Example 3 has many colors and doesn't clarify much. So, back to the test input.\n\n    The Test input shows `3`, `4`, `6`, and `2`. I can immediately identify the lattice (`4`). The test input has non-uniform lattice, so what is happening with the lattices is the important rule. I think 4 is the lattice. The task is to define the rule.\n\n    I see that Row 9 (index 9) shows `4`s. Col 9 shows `4`. It is not always straight. So there are some non-uniform lattice areas, as the \"lattice can vary\". So this means I need to classify the non-4s into the rectangular regions (Compartments). There are large blocks.\n\n*   \n\nTo solve this ARC task, we need to analyze the input image to identify the \"lattice\" structure and the distinct regions (compartments) it separates. Based on the provided examples and the test input, here is the step-by-step logical derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Lattice Color:**\n    *   Scanning the grid, we see a network of lines formed by the color `4` (yellow).\n    *   There is a prominent horizontal line at Row 9 and a vertical line at Column 9.\n    *   Other lines appear in the bottom-right quadrant (Row 20, Column 14).\n    *   Thus, the lattice color is `4`.\n\n2.  **Identify Regions and Labels:**\n    *   We look for the distinct regions enclosed or separated by the lattice.\n    *   **Top-Left (Region A):** Spanning roughly (0-8, 0-8). The dominant color is `3` (green), with some sparse `2` (red) noise. The label for this region is `3`.\n    *   **Top-Right (Region B):** Spanning roughly (0-8, 10-29). The interior is filled with `6` (magenta). The label is `6`.\n    *   **Bottom-Right (Region C):** Spanning roughly (21-29, 15-29). The interior is filled with `2` (red). The label is `2`.\n    *   **Background/Other:** The rest of the grid (Top-Right, Middle areas, much of Bottom-Left) is filled with `6`. Given its prevalence and the behavior in previous examples (where the most common color acts as a background), `6` serves as the background color.\n\n3.  **Determine Transformation Rules:**\n    *   The goal is to recolor the lattice pixels (`4`).\n    *   **Rule 1 (Label Adjacency):** If a lattice pixel is adjacent to a non-background label (`3` or `2`), it changes to that label color. This effectively expands the \"colored\" regions into their boundaries.\n    *   **Rule 2 (Background Adjacency):** If a lattice pixel is only adjacent to the background color (`6`) or other lattice pixels that are surrounded by background, it changes to the background color (`6`).\n    *   **Rule 3 (Junctions):** Junctions (intersections of lattice lines) follow the dominant non-background neighbor. For example, the crossing at (9,9) touches the `3` region, so it becomes `3`. The junction at (20,14) connects the `2` region boundaries, so it becomes `2`.\n    *   **Hierarchy:** `3` and `2` (Labels) > `6` (Background).\n\n4.  **Apply Transformation to Test Input:**\n    *   **Top-Left Boundary:**\n        *   The vertical line segment at Column 9 (Rows 0-9) is adjacent to the `3` region on the left. It changes to `3`.\n        *   The horizontal line segment at Row 9 (Cols 0-9) is adjacent to the `3` region above. It changes to `3`.\n        *   The intersection at (9,9) touches the `3` region. It changes to `3`.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Boundary:**\n        *   The horizontal line segment at Row 20 (Cols 15-29) is adjacent to the `2` region below. It changes to `2`.\n        *   The vertical line segment at Column 14 (Rows 21-29) is adjacent to the `2` region on the right. It changes to `2`.\n        *   The intersection at (20,14) connects these boundaries and is diagonally adjacent to `2`s. It changes to `2`.\n    *   **Background Boundaries:**\n        *   The horizontal line segment at Row 9 (Cols 10-29) separates two `6` regions. It changes to `6`.\n        *   The vertical line segment at Column 9 (Rows 10-29) separates two `6` regions. It changes to `6`.\n        *   Vertical segment Col 14 (Rows 0-20) is surrounded by `6`. It changes to `6`.\n        *   Any isolated `4` pixels or small segments inside the `6` regions change to `6`.\n    *   **Bottom-Left Pocket:**\n        *   There are some `4`s around (21-22, 0-6). The ones adjacent to the `3` pixels at (22, 0-1) will change to `3`. Others surrounded by `6` change to `6`.\n\n5.  **Final Grid Construction:**\n    *   We preserve all non-lattice pixels.\n    *   We replace `4`s based on the logic above:\n        *   `4`s touching `3` -> `3`.\n        *   `4`s touching `2` -> `2`.\n        *   All other `4`s -> `6`.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 24>\n<CANDIDATE 25>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333323333366666666666666666666\n332233333366666666666666662222\n223233333366666666666666662232\n233333333366666666666622222232\n333333233366666666666622222222\n223333323366666666666666666666\n333333333366666666666666666666\n333333333366666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666666666666666666\n666666666666666222222222222222\n333666666666662222222222222222\n333333366666662222222222222222\n323666666666662222222322222232\n323666666666662222232222222332\n333666666666662222222222222232\n333666666666662222222222322232\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n666666666666662222222222222222\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\nOkay, here's my thought process as I tackle this ARC task. First, I'm trying to get a handle on what the task *actually* wants me to do. It looks like I'm dealing with a grid-based puzzle where I need to recolor a lattice structure based on the contents of the regions the lattice creates.  I'm seeing grids, background colors, lattice lines (which are these thin lines that act as boundaries), and compartments (the areas inside those lattice boundaries). The problem states that the interior of these compartments have a distinct color, or maybe some kind of noise pattern. The description implies that I need to change these lattice line colors according to the contents, and from some examples, I understand there are labels for each region.\n\n**Initial Exploration:** I'm starting by analyzing the examples, particularly Example 1. It seems complex. I'm focusing on identifying the lattice color and the colors of regions. In Example 1, the background color is a kind of teal, and the lattice is also of the same color. There are rectangular regions with colors like 3,4 and those seem to be the labels I am looking for. I also realize that the lattice lines are not as simple or solid as they seem. It's not a solid line of the same color, but more of a segmented structure. I need to be careful with this, as it could mean the task has some hidden details.\n\n**Decoding the Lattice:** I'm rereading the transformation logic in the prompt. I have to *detect* the lattice - and the example description specifies it's orthogonal, intersecting lines. This leads me to believe the seemingly incomplete lattice in the examples is actually the core structure. It's just being obscured or interrupted by noise within a particular region.  I'm thinking:  \"I have to *find* and *reconstruct* the grid, *even* if it's not a solid line.\" From the examples, I gather that the color of a region influences the lattice color adjacent to it. For example, if a region has a dominant color, or a kind of noise color, that will change the lattice color. The lattice also has some logic related to the colors. If it's between two similar labels, it might keep its original color.\n\n**Region Labels and Boundary Logic:** My analysis of Example 1 really helped me grasp how this works. I see that the dominant interior color (or possibly the noise color, if it's there) becomes the label, and lattice boundary takes the color of the adjacent compartment. If two compartments touch, the lattice becomes the label color! I also realize some areas might only have background colors, which might be some form of a \"label\". In Example 3, if a region is only background, the lattice color changes to the background color.\n\n**Test Input Dive:** I'm moving on to the Test Input now to build a solution. I'm carefully analyzing its details and the lattice structure. I see different colors, and I have to *identify* the compartments and the dominant or noise colors to determine the labels. I need to figure out which color is background, which one is lattice, and if any of the labels, colors 2 and 3, belong to which region.  I'm trying to identify a lattice based on visual inspection and color distribution, because the prompt suggests a specific color in the prompt.\n\n**Applying the Rules:** Now I'm synthesizing the rules and getting really clear on the logic: 1. I need to *locate the lattice*. 2. I have to assign labels to each compartment. 3. I recolor the lattice, according to its adjacent compartments. Based on the rules, the lattice will be influenced by the adjacent label - I need to be *sure* about the order and the way the regions are located.\n\n**Junctions and Refinement:** I have to apply these rules at \"junctions.\" (Where the lattice lines cross or meet). Based on the 3x3 junction rule, the center is recolored, and outer eight pixels stay. So I have to find these junctions in the examples and make sure I know how to apply them. After finding and refining the rules, I made sure all those details are in a single section.\n\n**Building a Strategy:** I'm visualizing the Test Input and identifying the regions and the lattice. I'm going to create a mapping of the lattice based on its neighbors, and determine how each lattice pixel transforms to a new color. I've broken the test input into regions, and I am mapping those locations now. I'm also doing a step-by-step trace of how the rules influence each part of the lattice to create the final output. The key is to figure out the 3x3 lattice, and correctly map out regions in the Test Input so I know the labels and how they will impact the lattice. My current hypothesis is: \"\n\nThe solution involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Grid Structure:**\n    *   **Lattice:** The grid contains a lattice structure made of the color **4** (yellow).\n    *   **Background:** The dominant background color is **6** (magenta).\n    *   **Labels:** There are distinct regions filled with other colors:\n        *   **Region 1 (Top-Left):** Dominant color **3** (green). Defined by boundaries x=0-9, y=0-9.\n        *   **Region 2 (Bottom-Right):** Dominant color **2** (red). Large region starting around row 21 and column 15.\n        *   **Region 3 (Small Bottom-Left):** Dominant color **3** (green). A small block at rows 23-25, cols 0-1.\n        *   **Region 4 (Small Top-Right):** Dominant color **2** (red). A small C-shaped enclosure at row 5, cols 27-29.\n\n2.  **Determine Transformation Logic:**\n    *   The goal is to recolor the lattice lines (4) based on the label of the adjacent compartment.\n    *   **Rule 1:** If a lattice segment borders a labeled region (3 or 2), it takes that region's color.\n    *   **Rule 2:** If a lattice segment borders only the background (6), it takes the background color (6).\n    *   **Rule 3:** Connected lattice segments adjacent to a label effectively \"absorb\" that label.\n\n3.  **Apply Logic to Specific Lattice Segments:**\n\n    *   **Around Top-Left Region (Label 3):**\n        *   The horizontal line at **Row 9** (cols 0-9) borders the 3-region. **Change 4 to 3**.\n        *   The vertical line at **Col 9** (rows 0-9) borders the 3-region. **Change 4 to 3**.\n\n    *   **Around Bottom-Left Small Region (Label 3):**\n        *   The lattice enclosing this 2x3 block consists of **Row 22 (cols 0-2)**, **Row 26 (cols 0-2)**, and **Col 2 (rows 23-25)**.\n        *   Also, **Row 21 (cols 0-2)** is a lattice layer on top of Row 22. Being connected and adjacent to the region (via Row 22), it also changes.\n        *   **Change these 4s to 3**.\n\n    *   **Around Bottom-Right Region (Label 2):**\n        *   The horizontal boundary is **Row 20** (cols 16-29).

If a lattice pixel borders (N/S/E/W) a compartment with label **L** and does *not* separate two different labels, recolor that lattice pixel to **L**.\n   - Lattice pixels that do not border any labeled compartment stay **4**.\n\n5. **Special junction rule**: for any **3\u00d73 block that is entirely lattice (all 4s)**, keep the outer 8 pixels as 4 and recolor the **center** to the dominant label color (here **2**).\n\n6. **Do not change compartment interiors** (2/3/6 stay as they are).\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2  \n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2  \n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,2,2,3,2  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,4,2,2,2  \n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,4,4,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,4,2,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,4,6,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,6,6,4,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,3,3,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2  \n3,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 28>\n</INPUT_DATA>\n\n<AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\nExecute this pipeline sequentially for every Candidate.

Else, preserve color.\"\n- *Constraint:* If the reasoning is incoherent or vague, mark the Candidate as \"INVALID - VAGUE\".\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT (CRITICAL)\n- You must \"Back-Test\" the Crystallized Rule against the {{SOLVED_EXAMPLES}}.\n- For **EACH** Solved Example pair (Input -> Output), you must strictly perform this 3-step check:\n  1. **Hypothesis:** \"If I apply the Candidate's Rule to this Input, exactly what *should* happen?\"\n  2. **Observation:** \"Look at the actual Official Output. What *actually* happened?\"\n  3. **Verdict:** \"Do they match?\"\n- **Fatal Contradictions to Watch For:**\n  * **Scope Error:** Rule applies to specific colors (e.g., \"Blue\"), but the example changes \"Red\" pixels.\n  * **Geometry Error:** Rule says \"rotate 90,\" but example shows a flip.\n  * **Object Error:** Rule treats pixels individually, but example shows objects moving as blocks.\n- *Constraint:* Record exactly how many Solved Examples the candidate PASSED vs FAILED. **Do not stop at the first failure**; check all examples to determine the severity of the failure (e.g., \"Passed 2/3 Examples\").\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n- For Candidates that survived Phase 2 (or passed at least one example):\n- Look at the {{TEST_INPUT}} and the Candidate's <PROPOSED_SOLUTION> grid.\n- Does the proposed output actually follow the Crystallized Rule?\n- *Common Hallucination:* The text says \"Move Blue,\" but the grid shows Blue staying still.

Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the task is to predict the output of an ARC problem based on a few examples and a test input. I need to figure out the underlying logic. The grid sizes are the first thing I notice \u2013 16x16 in the examples, and a larger 30x30 test case. Colors are important, and I see distinct 'wall', 'background', and 'pattern' colors. My initial thought is to analyze the relationship between input and output, looking for changes in these colors and their positions.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis: Identifying the Pattern**\n\nIn Example 1, there's a clear 'wall' color (8, teal/light blue) that partitions the grid into regions. Inside these regions, I find repeating 'pattern' colors (3, 4) arranged in specific patterns. The output seems to alter the 'walls' and the regions they enclose.  The walls are either removed or changed, and the regions' content seem to propagate out. I'm focusing on connected regions \u2013 areas where the 'pattern' colors are touching each other, excluding walls and background. It's like a set of \"rooms\" with patterns inside and walls in between. I start by focusing on simple rectangular areas, tracing the lines of color 8.\n\n**Initial Hypothesis: Regional Expansion**\n\nMy first hypothesis is that the 'walls' take on the dominant color of the 'pattern' within their corresponding region. I start looking at coordinates and patterns, trying to identify rules for how the wall color changes. I see that the color of 8s is changed into the dominant color of the adjacent pixels.\n\n**Refining the Hypothesis: Majority Color and Edge Cases**\n\nAfter looking more carefully at Example 2, the 'walls' turn into the adjacent 'pattern' colors. I realize it is not the adjacent wall pixels that matter, but the internal pixels (dominant color). I now suspect it is a \"Majority Color\" rule: the 'walls' change to the most frequent color within the enclosed or adjacent 'pattern' region.\n\n**Testing the Theory and Dealing with Complex Regions**\n\nIn Example 3, 'walls' are separated by two different regions. I am now realizing that it works at the pixel level.  The \"conflict\" is solved at individual pixels within a wall. So now the wall does not change monolithically, it changes by the adjacent majority colors.\n\n**Algorithm Design and Edge Case Analysis**\n\nMy refined algorithm looks like this:\n\n1.  Identify the 'Background' color (usually the most common).\n2.  Identify the 'Wall' color (the lines separating regions).\n3.  Everything else is a 'Pattern'.\n4.  Find connected components of 'Pattern' colors.\n5.  Find connected components of 'Wall' pixels.\n6.  Match Wall components to Pattern components. The Wall changes to the Majority color.\n    A wall pixel belongs to a pattern group if it is next to a pattern pixel.\n\n**Applying the Algorithm to the Test Input**\n\nFor the test input (30x30), I quickly identify 'wall' color (4), then determine 'background' (6), and 'patterns' (3, 2). The goal now is to map 'wall' pixels to 'pattern' zones and apply the majority color rule. I go row by row and column by column and test whether they touch existing groups. I am seeing two main regions - one with 3, one with 2.\n\n**Test Case Analysis**\n\nNow, I analyze the 'wall' structure created by the color 4. I identify several connected components, including horizontal and vertical lines. I also start to analyze how each piece of this \"wall\" structure connects to the pattern regions. There are regions with a majority of 3 and regions with a majority of 2. I have a major \"conflict\" situation here - some 4s might touch both zones, and 4s need to become 2 or 3. It's becoming obvious that I have to examine each pixel very closely. I need to make sure each pixel becomes the right color in the end. I am assuming a 4-connectivity rule between wall pixels.\n\n**Final Solution**\nBased on this analysis, I will apply the logic of my algorithm to the specific grid structure. I am now working out the majority-propagation scheme for all the 'wall' pixels, taking into account any 'conflict' or ambiguous pixel locations. Now I will build my prediction.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by replacing the \"wall\" pixels with the dominant color of the adjacent pattern region.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Background Color:** 6 (Light Magenta/Pink). It fills the large empty areas.\n- **Wall Color:** 4 (Yellow). It forms the grid lines and boundaries.\n- **Pattern Regions:**\n    1.  **Top-Left Region (Rows 0-8, Cols 0-8):** Contains 3s (Green) and 2s (Red). The majority color is **3**.\n    2.  **Top-Right Small Region (Rows 3-6, Cols 26-29):** Enclosed by 4s. Contains 2s and 3s. The majority color is **2**.\n    3.  **Bottom-Right Region (Rows 21-29, Cols 15-29):** Contains 2s and 3s. The majority color is **2**.\n    4.  **Bottom-Left Region (Rows 22-25, Cols 0-2):** Contains 3s and 2s. The majority color is **3**.\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\n- Identify connected components of the wall (4s).\n- For each component (or part of a component), determine which Pattern Region it borders.\n- Change the color of the wall pixels to the majority color of that Pattern Region.\n- If a wall connects two different regions (e.g., the bar at Row 14 connecting Left-3 and Right-2), split the wall color based on proximity (left half becomes 3, right half becomes 2).\n- Isolated wall segments surrounded by background (6) that are part of a larger structure take the color of that structure.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n- **Top-Left Walls:** The horizontal line at Row 9 (Cols 0-9) and vertical line at Col 9 are adjacent to the 3-region. **Change 4 to 3.**\n- **Top-Right Enclosure:** The box at Cols 26-29 (Rows 3-6) encloses the 2-region. **Change 4 to 2.**\n- **Bottom-Right Walls:** The line at Row 20 (Cols 15-29) and vertical line at Col 14 are adjacent to the 2-region. **Change 4 to 2.**\n- **Bottom-Left Walls:** The vertical line at Col 2 and surroundings in Rows 21-25 enclose the 3-region. **Change 4 to 3.**\n- **Middle Connections:**\n    - Vertical line at Col 5 (Rows 10-13) connects to the Top-Left 3-system. **Change 4 to 3.**\n    - Vertical line at Col 12 (Rows 9-22) connects to the Bottom-Right 2-system. **Change 4 to 2.**\n    - Horizontal bar at Row 14 (Cols 9-14) connects the Left (3) and Right (2) systems. We split it: Left half (9,10,11) becomes **3**, Right half (12,13,14) becomes **2**.\n    - Horizontal bar at Row 16 (Cols 6-9) connects to Col 9 (3-system). **Change 4 to 3.**\n    - Vertical line at Col 6 (Rows 16-22) connects to the Bottom-Left 3-system. **Change 4 to 3.**\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n- **R0-8:** Wall at Col 9 becomes 3. Walls at Top-Right (C26-29) become 2. Vertical walls at C14, C22 become 2.\n- **R9:** C0-9 becomes 3. C12, C14 become 2.\n- **R10-13:** C5, C9 become 3.

My initial thought is, this seems like a pattern completion or image inpainting task. I have three examples and a test input to work from. Let's break down the examples.\n\n**Example 1** seems like a \"collage\" or \"repair\" job where there are some corrupted image patches with some clean blocks. The key is that it seems to use the clean blocks to fill in the corrupted areas. The walls between them are like separators or noise. From this, the strategy should be to identify a repeating pattern and replace the noisy elements with their pattern counterparts to inpaint the images.\n\nThen I look at **Example 2**, and it seems to reinforce the inpainting hypothesis, but this time with a cross-shaped separator. Again, it is important to replace the \"noise\" color and complete or tile the pattern.\n\n**Example 3** solidifies the need for the pattern completion. It is a very noisy image with walls, but the output is very clean and structured.\n\nThe **Test Input** has this repeating pattern and structure. It appears to be made up of tiles - a green tile and a red tile. The task is to \"complete\" the image across a horizontal boundary, which suggests pattern completion with a vertical split. The columns on the left contain green tiles, whereas the columns on the right are made of red tiles.\n\nSince there are only \"clean\" blocks in the image and some noisy \"walls\", let's identify the signal pattern to fill the gaps and make a full-sized clean image, using a periodicity of 9.\n\nSo my approach:\n1.  **Extract the clean green tile (TL) and red tile (BR).**\n2.  **Define a basic 9-pixel green pattern (G) from TL, and 9-pixel red pattern (R) from BR. I will handle the \"wall\" color 4 through modulo operations.**\n3.  **Create a 30x30 output image.**\n4.  **Fill the output image:**\n    *   Left side (cols 0-14): use the Green pattern $G$ and tile vertically.\n    *   Right side (cols 15-29): use the Red pattern $R$ and tile vertically.\n5.  **Use modulo 9 to ensure proper pattern continuity at each column.**\nThis should give a reasonably complete solution!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where the input grid contains \"clean\" pattern patches and large areas of \"noise\" or \"empty\" space (walls and background). We need to reconstruct the full image based on the available clean patterns.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n- **Example 1:** The input contains 4x4 patches of a specific texture (3s and 4s) in the corners. The rest of the grid is filled with noise (8s) and background (9s). The output preserves the clean patches and fills the noise/walls with the pattern, effectively inpainting the grid. The background (9s) is preserved.\n- **Example 2:** The input has regions separated by \"noise\" walls (5s). Some regions are empty (0s), some are filled with a pattern (1s and 2s). The solution propagates the pattern into the noise walls and empty regions where appropriate, respecting the boundaries.\n- **Test Input:** The grid is 30x30.\n    - There are \"walls\" of color 4 and 6 separating the grid.\n    - There is a clean patch of \"Green Pattern\" (colors 3 and 2, mostly 3) in the Top-Left (TL) corner (rows 0-8, cols 0-8).\n    - There is a clean patch of \"Red Pattern\" (colors 2 and 3, mostly 2) in the Bottom-Right (BR) corner (rows 21-29, cols 21-29).\n    - The rest of the grid is filled with noise (4s and 6s) or partially corrupted data (Bottom-Left).\n    - The grid structure implies a vertical split at column 15. The left side (cols 0-14) seems to correspond to the Green Pattern, and the right side (cols 15-29) to the Red Pattern.\n\n**Solution Logic:**\n1.  **Extract Patterns:**\n    - Extract the 9x9 Top-Left patch ($P_G$) from the input (rows 0-8, cols 0-8). This is the source for the Green Pattern.\n    - Extract the 9x9 Bottom-Right patch ($P_R$) from the input (rows 21-29, cols 21-29). This is the source for the Red Pattern.\n\n2.  **Define Filling Strategy:**\n    - The grid is treated as a tiling or periodic extension of these patches. The walls (index 9, 20) suggest a periodicity of roughly 10, or simply that the 9x9 pattern repeats. Given the seamless reconstruction in Example 1, we will tile the 9x9 patterns using modulo arithmetic.\n    - **Left Half (Cols 0-14):** Filled with the Green Pattern $P_G$.\n      - $Output(r, c) = P_G[r \\pmod 9, c \\pmod 9]$.\n    -

There's a \"boundary\" color that forms lines/edges (8 in Ex1, 5 in Ex2, 7 in Ex3, and 4 in the test)\n2. There are pattern regions containing non-boundary, non-background colors\n3. The transformation replaces boundary cells with the dominant color from the pattern region they're connected to\n4. At intersections where multiple patterns meet, boundaries may be preserved\n\nFor the test input:\n- Boundary color: 4\n- Background color: 6  \n- Pattern regions:\n  - Top-left (rows 0-8, cols 0-8): 3s and 2s, dominant color = 3\n  - Top-right (rows 4-5, cols 27-29): 2s and 3s, dominant color = 2\n  - Bottom-left (rows 22-24, cols 0-1): 3s and 2s, dominant color = 3\n  - Bottom-right (rows 21-29, cols 15-29): 2s and 3s, dominant color = 2\n\nI trace the boundary network from each pattern region and color the connected boundaries with that region's dominant color. Boundaries at intersections are preserved.\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n      2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n      2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n      2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n      3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"3\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nAcross the examples, one color acts like a *corridor / boundary material* that must be \u201cclaimed\u201d by nearby *seed colors*:\n\n- There is a dominant **background** color that stays unchanged.\n- There is a special **fill/boundary** color (the one that changes in the output).\n- All remaining colors act as **seeds** that \u201cspread\u201d through the boundary color.\n\n**Rule: geodesic Voronoi fill on the boundary-color pixels**\n\n1. Identify the **background** = most frequent color in the grid (in the examples this is 9, 0, 8; in the test it is 6).\n2. Identify the **boundary/fill color** = the color that forms paths/frames between regions and is the one recolored in the outputs (in the examples: 8, 5, 7; in the test it is 4).\n3. The **seed colors** are all colors except `{background, boundary}` (in the test these are 2 and 3).\n4. Consider the graph made of only the **boundary-color cells** (4-connected adjacency).\n5. For every boundary cell, compute the shortest-path distance **within this boundary graph** to the nearest boundary cell that is adjacent (4-neighbor) to a seed color:\n   - distance to seed-color 2 territory\n   - distance to seed-color 3 territory\n6. Recolor each boundary cell:\n   - If distance-to-2 < distance-to-3 \u21d2 change boundary cell to **2**\n   - If distance-to-3 < distance-to-2 \u21d2 change boundary cell to **3**\n   - If the distances are equal \u21d2 **leave it as the boundary color** (this produces the \u201cwatershed\u201d line that stays unchanged, like the remaining 5/7/8 in the examples)\n\nAll non-boundary cells are copied unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test grid\n- Background = **6**\n- Boundary/fill color = **4**\n- Seeds = **2** and **3**\n- Recolor all 4\u2019s by nearest-seed distance along the

exactly **two other colors** appearing in regions near the corridor (these act like **paint sources**).\n\n**Goal:** recolor the corridor/network using the two source colors.\n\n#### Steps\n1. **Find the background color** = the most frequent color in the grid.\n2. **Find the corridor color** = the remaining color that forms the large connected network (in the examples it was 8, 5, 7; here it is 4).\n3. The remaining two colors are the **source colors** (here: 2 and 3).\n4. Consider only the cells of the corridor color (4).  \n   For each source color separately:\n   - treat every corridor cell that is **orthogonally adjacent** to a seed pixel of that source color as a **distance-0 source**.\n   - run a shortest-path flood (BFS) **only through corridor cells** to compute distance-to-that-source-color for every corridor cell.\n5. For each corridor cell:\n   - if it is closer to source color 2 \u2192 recolor it **2**\n   - if it is closer to source color 3 \u2192 recolor it **3**\n   - if the distances tie \u2192 keep it as the original corridor color (**4**)  \n   (this produces the thin \u201cdivider line\u201d seen in the examples)\n\nAll non-corridor cells stay unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2  \n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2  \n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,3,2  \n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2  \n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n      2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n      2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n      2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n      3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"4\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nAcross the examples, one color acts like a large \u201cbuffer/unknown\u201d region (Example1: `8`, Example2: `5`, Example3: `7`). That buffer is recolored by *spreading* the other (non-background) colors into it, like a Voronoi fill constrained to move only through the buffer cells.\n\nA precise way to reproduce the outputs:\n\n1. **Find the background color** = the most frequent color in the grid.  \n   This stays unchanged and does *not* spread.\n2. **Find the fillable/buffer color** = the second most frequent color in the grid.  \n   This is the only color that may change.\n3. Consider all remaining colors (everything except background and buffer) as **seed colors**. They stay fixed.\n4. For each cell of the **buffer color**, determine which seed color reaches it first by a **multi-source BFS** that:\n   - Moves in **4 directions** (up/down/left/right).\n   - Moves **only through buffer-color cells**.\n   - Starts from every buffer cell that is adjacent (4-neigh) to a seed cell, tagged with that seed\u2019s color.\n5. **Recolor** each buffer cell to the winning seed color.\n   - If two different seed colors reach a buffer cell at the **same minimum distance**, **leave it as the buffer color** (this creates the remaining buffer-color \u201cwatershed\u201d cells seen in the examples).\n6. All non-buffer cells remain unchanged.\n\nFor the test grid:\n- Background (most common) is `6`\n- Buffer (second most common) is `4`\n- Seed colors are `{2, 3}`\nSo we spread `2` and `3` into the `4`-cells, leaving `6`, `2`, `3` unchanged, and keeping `4` only on exact ties.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2  \n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2  \n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2  \n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2  \n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n      2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n      2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n      2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n      3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"5\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**My Solution Strategy for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out.  I've been given some examples, and my job is to come up with a rule to transform the input into the output.  It seems to be about identifying regions and filling them according to the pattern within those regions.  There's some kind of \"wall\" or \"separator\" color that is important to recognize.\n\n**Initial Exploration:**\n\nI started by looking at a 16x16 example, noticing that the grid was broken down into different colored regions separated by lines of a specific color (8).  I traced the colors to understand how they changed from input to output.  It seemed that some colors were just preserved, but the \"wall\" color (8) would get overwritten by an adjacent region's primary colors, like the pixels from neighboring regions. Then, I looked at a 10x10 example, where the wall color was 5. I noticed a clear cross shape of those 5s. In the outputs, the 5s were replaced. The regions seemed to be defined by that separator. I also saw that the output 5s were not always replaced, which made it confusing.\n\n**Refining the Idea:**\n\nThe initial idea was \"clean up\" the grid by removing the wall colors and letting the regions' \"patterns\" expand. It looked like some form of flood-fill, or connected components. The wall was a disruption. The key seemed to be making connected components and \"filling\" the walls with the dominant color in that area.\n\n**Connecting Components and the Main Pattern**\n\nI figured out that the problem seems to be an iterative pattern expansion:\n\n1.  Identify \"Wall,\" \"Background,\" and \"Pattern\" colors.\n2.  If it is a wall pixel, replace the wall pixels with the color of the adjacent pattern.\n\nBased on the examples, the walls were usually one pixel thick but could get a little noisy.\nThe main \"wall\" colors are:\n-   8 in example 1\n-   5 in example 2\n-   7 in example 3.\nI could find the non-wall pixels by identifying them using their color, or by finding the connected components of the \"wall\".\n\nI initially thought about the distance from the non-wall neighbors, but then realized it was simpler.\n\nThe rule:\n1.  **Define Wall color:** The color that visually outlines the regions.\n2.  **Define background color:** Large area covering other regions, for Ex 1.\n3.  **Iterate Through Wall Pixels**. For each wall pixel. find its neighboring pixels.\n4.  **Find the pattern pixels' color**: Choose the neighbor's color that is not a background or a wall.\n\nThis strategy helped me understand the transformation. This is what I applied to the test case, finding a 30 x 30 grid with 4 as wall. The logic was to let the background, Pattern colors overwrite wall color.\n\n**Validation**\n\nI double checked with the examples, and the test code.\n\nNow, I think I have it. I need to run this on the actual test input.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify the transformation rule from the solved examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs consist of regions of \"pattern\" colors (like 3, 2, 6) separated by \"wall\" or \"grid\" lines of a specific color (8 in Ex 1, 5 in Ex 2, 7 in Ex 3).\n2.  **Transformation:** The \"wall\" pixels are replaced by colors from the adjacent regions.\n3.  **Hierarchy/Priority:**\n    *   There appears to be a \"Background\" color in each example which is a solid, large area color (9 in Ex 1, 0 in Ex 2, 8 in Ex 3).\n    *   There are \"Pattern\" colors which are the distinct regions (3/4 in Ex 1, 1/2 in Ex 2, 6/5 in Ex 3).\n    *   **Rule:** Wall pixels are replaced by the adjacent **Pattern** color. If a wall separates a Pattern region and a Background region, the Pattern color expands into the wall. If a wall separates two Pattern regions, it likely takes the color of the nearest one. If a wall is surrounded only by Background, it becomes Background.\n    *   Specifically, in Example 1, the wall (8) between the noisy 3/4 region and the background 9 region becomes 3 (the dominant color of the noisy region). The wall between the background 9 and the 4 region becomes 4.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Roles:**\n    *   **Wall Color:** 4 (Forms horizontal and vertical lines separating regions).\n    *   **Background Color:** 6 (Occupies the large Top-Right and Middle areas, separating the distinct Top-Left and Bottom-Right regions).\n    *   **Pattern Colors:**\n        *   **3:** Dominates the Top-Left region (with some 2s mixed in).\n        *   **2:** Dominates the Bottom-Right region.\n        *   **3 & 2:** Small cluster in the Bottom-Left.\n\n2.  **Execution:** We iterate through the \"Wall\" pixels (4) and replace them based on connectivity:\n    *   **Top-Left Boundary:** The vertical wall at Column 9 (rows 0-9) and horizontal wall at Row 9 (cols 0-9) border the Top-Left 3-region. They are replaced by **3**.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Boundary:** The walls bordering the Bottom-Right 2-region (Row 20 cols 14-29, and the vertical/irregular boundary around cols 13-15 in rows 21-22) are replaced by **2**.\n    *   **Bottom-Left Cluster:** There is a small mixed region of 3s and 2s in the bottom left (rows 21-25). The 4s touching the 3s become **3**, and the 4s touching the 2s become **2**.\n    *   **Background Areas:** The 4s inside the 6-regions (Top-Right, Middle) or separating 6-regions are replaced by **6**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Replacement:**\n*   **Row 9 (Cols 0-9):** Input `4`s become **3**.\n*   **Col 9 (Rows 0-9):** Input `4`s become **3**. Intersection at (9,9) becomes 3.\n*   **Row 20 (Cols 14-29):** Input `4`s become **2** (bordering the 2-region below).\n*   **Row 21:**\n    *   Cols 0-2 (`4,4,4`): Touch the 3-region below. Become **3**.\n    *   Col 6 (`4`): Inside 6-region. Becomes **6**.\n    *   Col 12 (`4`): Inside 6-region. Becomes **6**.\n    *   Col 15 (`4`): Touches 2-region. Becomes **2**.\n*   **Row 22:**\n    *   Cols 2-6 (`4,4,4,4,4`):\n        *   Col 2 touches 3 (left). Becomes **3**.\n        *   Col 3 touches 3 (new left). Becomes **3**.\n        *   ... Col 6 touches 3 chain. Becomes **3**. (Pattern expands over BG).\n    *   Cols 12-15 (`4,4,4`): Touch 2-region (right/below). Become **2**.\n*   **Row 23:**\n    *   Col 2 (`4`): Touches 2 (left). Becomes **2**.\n    *   Other 4s in 6-region become **6**.\n*   **Row 24:**\n    *   Col 2 (`4`): Touches 2 (left).

The user wants me to crack an ARC task, given a few solved examples and a test input. I need to figure out the hidden logic behind the image transformations. Here's a breakdown of my thinking:\n\n1.  **Initial Scan & Feature Extraction:** First, I'm looking at the dimensions of the images, the values, and the colours. Quickly noting any obvious differences between the inputs and outputs (like the input and output sizes are the same). The main thing I'm noticing is the colour that seems to be acting as a \"separator\" or \"wall\" between other patterns and the images seem to be of the same size.\n2.  **Example 1 Deep Dive:** This is a 16x16 grid where one colour (I'll call it the *wall* colour, often number 8 in the first example) is the separator. Inside, a shape of one colour is present, with colours on either side. My intuition tells me that the \"wall\" colour is somehow being replaced or altered.\n    *   I looked at the shapes of the coloured blocks, their position relative to the \"wall\" and I'm seeing an obvious rule - the \"wall\" is being replaced, and what is *outside* the wall is, in some way, influencing the area. It looks like the wall colour is being removed and replaced by the neighbouring colours.\n    *   I'm verifying if it's based on repetition, pattern filling, or is it more like a slide or overlap?\n\n3.  **Example 2 Analysis:** I'm moving on to this new grid, it introduces a \"5\" wall, but its behaviour is slightly different in that the result isn't a simple removal of the \"wall\" colour. It seems the inner colours are propagating or moving over the barrier.\n    *   This is leading me to think in terms of a shape, with the wall colour being a boundary or occluding element, and the rest is being stitched together.\n    *   The 5's aren't removed, they're merged with the pattern, implying something more complex.\n\n4.  **Hypotheses Formation & Testing:**\n    *   **Hypothesis 1 (Folding/Unfolding):** My first instinct is about folding. The \"wall\" is a crease, and the image is bending along that crease. But the shape of the wall is irregular in Example 1, breaking the simple fold possibility.\n    *   **Hypothesis 2 (Sliding/Translation):** Could it be that components of the image are sliding past the wall and merging? The wall is a mask, and the rule is about how one side \"bumps\" into the other and mixes. This seems like a better match for example 2.\n        *   Example 3: the images is simpler, with 7 as the \"wall\" and the shapes on either side are simpler.\n        *   Then I checked - is it a Left-Right combination? Where does each piece shift?\n    *   **Hypothesis 3 (\"Pattern Propagation\"):** Is the rule about how patterns, if present, overwrite the \"wall\" colour. The examples 1 and 2 don't have clear patterns, but a mix, while example 3 seems to suggest a \"pattern\" propagation - from the left to the right side of the image. The Test input - 3s on the Left, 6 on the Right, with a 4-wall in between, strengthens this thought.\n\n5.  **Refining with Test Input:** This is where I'm applying the hypothesis to a new dataset, making sure my rule works in all situations.\n    *   Now the Test Input has a 4-wall, and the images on the Left and Right don't have easy-to-detect patterns.\n    *   I am focusing on how these coloured areas \"fill in\" the 4s using vertical propagation or, more frequently, *horizontal* propagation from each side.\n    *   I'm seeing that, the colour with a more clear *pattern* or the *colour* with the pattern propagates into the \"Wall\".\n\n6.  **\"Dominant\" Region Concept** After reviewing examples, the rule seems to depend on the \"dominance\" between the two regions (Left and Right).\n    *   What determines dominance? In most examples, 2, 3 have a clear *pattern*. Then I check the Examples: Example 1, 2 and 3.\n    *   If a patterned or complex region (3s and 2s) is next to 4, this zone wins (becomes 2 or 3).\n    *   Then I apply this concept to the test input.\n\n7.  **Finalize\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n1.  **Identify the \"Wall\"**: There is a specific color acting as a separator or \"wall\" (8 in Ex 1, 5 in Ex 2, 7 in Ex 3, and 4 in the Test Input). The goal is to replace this wall color with colors from the adjacent regions.\n2.  **Dominance Rule**: When the wall separates two regions, the color from the \"Dominant\" region floods into the wall.\n    *   **Pattern/Texture > Flat/Background**: Regions with complex patterns or specific details (like the mixed 3s and 4s in Ex 1, or 2s and 1s in Ex 2) are dominant over flat, uniform regions (like the 0s in Ex 2 or the 6s in Ex 3 and Test Input).\n    *   **Outer > Inner**: In Example 1, the outer patterned region overwrites the wall bordering the inner region.\n    *   **Vertical Propagation**: If horizontal neighbors don't resolve the fill (e.g., at a corner or horizontal bar of the wall), the dominant pattern propagates vertically (as seen in Ex 1, Row 4, and inferred for the Test Input).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Wall Color**: 4.\n*   **Regions**:\n    *   **Left Side (Rows 0-9)**: Contains 3s mixed with 2s (Textured/Dominant).\n    *   **Right Side (Rows 0-9)**: Contains 6s (Flat/Recessive).\n    *   **Middle (Rows 10-20)**: Mostly 6s on both sides.\n    *   **Bottom Left (Rows 21-29)**: Contains 3s and 2s (Textured/Dominant).\n    *   **Bottom Right (Rows 21-29)**: Contains 2s (Textured/Dominant) and 6s.\n\n**Transformation Steps:**\n*   **Rows 0-9**: The wall at column 9 separates the Dominant Left (3s) and Recessive Right (6s). The 3s propagate rightward, replacing the 4s.\n*   **Row 10**: The wall forms a horizontal bar. The Dominant 3s from the top propagate down to fill the 4s.\n*   **Rows 11-20**: The wall 4s are surrounded by 6s. They are filled with 6s.\n*   **Row 21**: The 4s on the left (`4,4,4`) are filled with 6s from the top (since the 6s above are the only neighbor, and 4s form a block). The 4s on the right (separating 6 and 2) are filled with 2s (Dominant).\n*   **Row 22**: The block of 4s on the left separates 3s (Left) and 6s (Right). 3s are dominant, so 4s -> 3s. On the right, 4s separate 6s and 2s. 2s are dominant -> 2s.\n*   **Rows 23-25**: Similar logic. 4s adjacent to 3s/2s become 3s/2s. Note in Row 25, the leftmost 4s fill from the top pattern (`3,2,2`).\n*   **Rows 26-29**: The 4s separating 6s and 2s are filled with 2s.\n\nOutput Grid:\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n      2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,3,2\n      2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,2,3,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n      2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n      3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"7\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Identify the boundary/grid color** (forms lines separating regions): 8 in Ex1, 5 in Ex2, 7 in Ex3, **4 in test**\n2. **Identify the background color**: 9 in Ex1, 0 in Ex2, 8 in Ex3, **6 in test**\n3. **Identify source regions** (contain pattern colors): corners/edges with non-background, non-boundary colors\n4. **Find dominant color** in each source region\n5. **Transform**: Boundary lines extending from each source become that source's dominant color. Junction areas (where paths from different sources meet) remain as the boundary color.\n\nFor the test input:\n- **Top-left source** (rows 0-8, cols 0-8): mostly 3s with some 2s \u2192 **3

  <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nAcross the examples, one color acts like a *corridor/outline* that connects many places (Example1: `8`, Example2: `5`, Example3: `7`). The remaining colors form \u201cseed regions\u201d sitting next to this corridor color, while the most common color is the background and never changes.\n\n**Rule:**\n1. **Identify the background color** = the most frequent color in the grid. (It stays unchanged.)\n2. **Identify the corridor color** = the color that forms the connected \u201cnetwork\u201d being overwritten (it is not the background, and it is the one that gets replaced by other colors).\n3. Let **seed colors** be all colors that are **neither background nor corridor**.\n4. **Propagate seed colors into the corridor** using shortest-path distance **moving only through corridor cells** (4-neighbor moves).\n   - For each corridor cell, compute the minimum corridor-path distance to each seed color (equivalently: multi-source BFS starting from all seed-colored cells, but only entering corridor cells).\n   - Replace that corridor cell with the seed color that reaches it with **strictly smaller** distance than all others.\n   - If there is a **tie** for smallest distance (two different seed colors reach it equally fast), **leave it as the corridor color**.\n\n### Applying to the test grid\n- Background is `6` (dominant).\n- Corridor/outline network is `4`.\n- Seed colors are `{2, 3}`.\n- Fill all `4` cells by corridor-distance to nearest `2` vs nearest `3`, keeping `4` only where distances tie.\n\n---\n\n## Output

unchanged (e.g., 9 in ex.1, 0 in ex.2, 8 in ex.3).\n- There is a **bridge color** (ex.1: 8, ex.2: 5, ex.3: 7) that forms connected corridors/regions.\n- Exactly **two other non-background colors** exist; they behave like **competing sources** (ex.1: 3 & 4, ex.2: 1 & 2, ex.3: 6 & 5).\n- The task fills the bridge region by deciding, for each bridge cell, **which source is closer** via paths that stay inside the bridge color.\n\nA robust way to reproduce the example outputs is:\n\n1. **Identify background** = most common color.\n2. **Identify bridge** = the remaining color that gets changed (the \u201ccorridor\u201d color).\n3. The remaining two colors are the **source colors**.\n4. To avoid small noisy components influencing the fill (as seen in ex.2), use the **largest connected component** of each source color as the true source region.\n5. Consider the graph of cells of the bridge color (4-neighbor connections).\n6. For every bridge cell, compute:\n   - \\(d_A\\): shortest path length *through bridge cells only* to any bridge cell adjacent to the largest component of source color A.\n   - \\(d_B\\): same for source color B.\n7. Replace the bridge cell by:\n   - source color A if \\(d_A < d_B\\)\n   - source color B if \\(d_B < d_A\\)\n   - keep the bridge color if \\(d_A = d_B\\) (ties remain as the divider)\n\n### Applying to the test\n\n- Background is **6** (dominant).\n- Bridge color is **4**.\n- The two source colors are **3** and **2**.\n- Largest 3-component is the big cluster in the upper-left; largest 2-component is the big cluster in the lower-right.\n- Filling the connected 4-network by shortest-path distance produces almost all 4\u2019s turning into 3 on the \u201cupper/left\u201d side and into 2 on the \u201clower/right\u201d side, with a small tie line (remaining 4s) around the central meeting area.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,3,3,3,3\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3\n      2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,3,2\n      2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,3,3,3,3\n      2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n      3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"10\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Here's how I'm thinking about this task:**\n\nI've been asked to solve an ARC task, specifically one that involves pattern recognition and transformation on a grid. My first step is always to understand the core request. It's about figuring out the pattern within the input-output pairs and then applying that pattern to a new, unseen input.  The user's phrasing is a bit unusual; they're talking about avoiding a \"chain-of-thought\" and using words like \"maximal test-time reasoning.\"  My interpretation is this:  they want me to get to the answer, provide an explanation of my *reasoning*, but without showing every single little mental step or trail of investigation. That's a reasonable request, and I'll focus on delivering a clear, concise explanation of my *conclusions* about the pattern. I won't, as requested, show all the internal scratchwork or intermediate attempts that got me there, just the final, distilled logic.\n\nWith that in mind, I dove into the examples. I started by looking at the basic structure of the grids: their size, the colors used, and any obvious organizational patterns. The initial examples all seem to represent a map or a segmented region of space, with walls defining different areas. In these examples, the *walls* appear to be the element that changes, whereas the content inside the \"rooms\" is preserved or transformed in a consistent way.  I started by looking at the input, and then checking it against the output.  The main transformation appears to be that the walls take on the *color of the data pixels that were nearest to them.*\n\nI considered various hypotheses like symmetry, rotation, and even something more complex like in-painting or copying. After careful examination of all three provided examples, I have determined the algorithm's principle. It seems I am dealing with a kind of Voronoi diagram or region filling process. The core idea is that the \"wall\" pixels will change color to \"merge\" into the nearest *connected* region. The background pixels remain unchanged, and the areas containing data pixels act like \"seeds\". By observing all three provided examples, I could verify the algorithm with various data sets, background and wall colors, with a reasonable confidence to extrapolate to a new example.\n\nFor the new test case, I did this: I recognized which color represents the background, the walls, and the data. Then, I identified the main data regions (those areas where the \"real content\" resides). I then performed an operation: I considered that \"wall\" pixels near the data region should be assigned the color of the dominant color in that nearest region. The pattern is about the data regions controlling the color of the boundaries separating them.\n\nFrom this analysis, I could produce the output, by finding the appropriate boundary, and transforming the elements by determining their position (above or below the line), as well as a short logical explanation of how I did this, as requested.\n\nHere's the final output grid:\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n2,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6\n\nThe transformation rule involves a \"territorial propagation\" where wall structures (represented by color 4) absorb the identity of the nearest enclosed data region (colors 2 or 3).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Decomposition**: The grid is composed of a background field (6), data regions containing specific colors (2 and 3), and a skeletal wall structure (4).\n2.  **Pattern Identification**: In the examples, the \"wall\" pixels change color to match the dominant color of the adjacent data region. This creates a Voronoi-like partition where the walls are claimed by the nearest \"biome\".\n3.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    -   The input contains a Top-Left region and a small Bottom-Left region dominated by color **3**.\n    -   There is a large Bottom-Right region dominated by color **2**.\n    -   The wall structure (4) connects these regions.\n    -   By tracing the connectivity and distance, the walls separate into two domains.

My goal is to figure out the logic behind it, and that involves analyzing three example grids and then applying the pattern to a test input.  I'm given a bunch of instructions, but there's a slight contradiction: I'm told to both *not* reveal my chain of thought and *also* to explain my thinking! Usually, the \"explain your thinking\" part wins out, so that's what I'll do. Plus, it's what's needed for the task!\n\nFirst, I looked carefully at the examples, which are about painting/filling regions in a grid. Each grid has different \"wall\" colors that form the boundary between the regions, but the goal is to *remove* those \"wall\" colors based on the surrounding color(s) and expand the regions. \n\nI started by looking at the specific input and output. The background color stays the same. The \"wall\" color, also called \"separator color\" in my mind, is removed. I noticed that the colors inside the regions seem to \"spill\" out, but how does the color spread? Do neighboring colors influence each other? If so, what is the most common color in each region and how is the \"wall\" color affected?\n\nI formed this refined hypothesis: the \"walls\" (a specific color) of a grid are removed and replaced by the color *most* frequently found in the enclosed or adjacent region. The \"most frequent color\" thing is very important. I started looking at the border of the input region and also what is the background color. \n\nSo the algorithm is to 1) Find the \"background\" color, 2) Find the \"wall\"/\"separator\" color, 3) find the other \"pattern\" colors and their connected components (regions), 4) Find the *most* frequently found color (MFC) for each region, 5) Replace all separator color pixels with the associated MFC.\n\nI ran into some tricky bits: What happens if two regions are right next to each other, and which color will the wall \"take\"? This seemed like a more general problem, so I went back to the examples. Looking carefully at the examples, it looked like I had to account for these issues.\n\nI then started to apply a multi-source BFS (\"breadth-first search\") to propagate. This meant that the wall becomes the color of the regions that it touches. It doesn't actually remove the wall, but converts the wall to the most common color of each region. It also takes time.\nIn the output example, I saw the distance to the adjacent regions are accounted for and the conflict has no resolution.\n\nThen, there was a test input to work on. \n\nIn the test input, I found a 3-region and a 2-region. The walls connect the regions in a complex structure, so that's where I need to pay attention. I then focused on the separators. I thought about the meeting point. I then decided that the \"meeting point\" or equidistant points from the regions that had separators would not be colored.\n\nThe basic idea I came up with is if you know that each color is a source, then start from the start points and color any neighboring separator. I decided if a separator is a path between two colors, it's the point where the color merges.\n\nI tried to use a specific, careful process:\n1)  Copy the test input, 2) Identify the separator color 4, 3) Identify regions of each, 4) Calculate color.\nAfter many checks, I was ready to proceed. I have a clear plan.\nI will produce the output as follows:  Any 4s above the 15th row will be 3. The 4s in the 15th row will stay 4. The 4s below will be 2.\n\nAfter that, I made a few final checks and went back and looked at the test input more carefully to make sure there weren't any \"dangling\" parts of the structure that I missed. This kind of careful tracing is essential for getting the right answer!\n\nI have the output now, I'm ready to write it.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rule is a \"Voronoi-style propagation\" or \"in-painting\" of the separator grid lines (color 4) based on the connectivity to the colored pattern regions.\n\n1.  **Identify Components:**\n    *   **Background:** Color 6.\n    *   **Separator:** Color 4.\n    *   **Pattern Regions:**\n        *   **Top-Left / Bottom-Left:** Connected regions of color 3 (and some 2s mixed in). The dominant color is **3**. These regions are effectively a single \"source\" for color 3.\n        *   **Bottom-Right:** Connected region of color 2. The dominant color is **2**. This is the \"source\" for color 2.\n\n2.  **Propagation Rule:**\n    *   The separator pixels (4) form a connected graph (skeleton).\n    *   The skeleton is colored based on the graph distance to the nearest Pattern Region.\n    *   Pixels closer to the **3-region** become **3**.\n    *   Pixels closer to the **2-region** become **2**.\n    *   Pixels that are **equidistant** from both regions remain **4** (serving as a boundary/buffer).\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Source 3** enters the skeleton primarily at Row 9 (Top) and Row 22 (Bottom-Left).\n    *   **Source 2** enters the skeleton at Row 21/22 (Bottom-Right).\n    *   **Vertical Channel at Column 9:** Connects Top-3 to Bottom-Left-3.

In the test input, this is 4.\n\n2. **Colored Regions**: There are distinct colored regions at corners/edges:\n   - Top-left: 3-dominant region (with some 2s)\n   - Bottom-right: 2-dominant region (with some 3s)\n   - Top-right small region: 2-dominant (rows 4-6, cols 27-29)\n   - Bottom-left small region: 3-dominant (rows 22-24, cols 0-2)\n\n3. **Transformation Rule**: Path cells (4s) get replaced with the dominant color of the region they connect to, except for junction cells where multiple paths meet - these remain as the path color.\n\n4. **Junction Identification**: The central junction where major paths intersect (around rows 11-13, cols 12-14) retains the path color 4.\n\n5. **Path Propagation**:\n   - Path cells connected to 3-regions become 3\n   - Path cells connected to 2-regions become 2\n   - Background (6s) and original colored region cells remain unchanged\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```\n

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_7_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nOkay, here\u2019s my thought process on this ARC task. The user wants me to figure out a rule for transforming grid images, based on examples with a similar network structure but different colors.\n\n**Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown:**\n\nI need to analyze a few examples where a \u2018network\u2019 (like lines or a cross shape) of one color connects to rectangular \u2018terminator\u2019 regions of other colors. The task is to determine how the network color changes in the output grid, based on the colors in the terminator regions.\n\n**Example Analysis and Pattern Recognition:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**  A cyan network connects to regions of green/yellow. The cyan network changes to green or yellow based on the dominant colors of the connecting terminator regions. Importantly, there\u2019s a junction where the lines meet that seems to preserve the original color or take on a mix.\n*   **Example 2:** A grey network connects to red/blue blocks. The network changes to red or blue based on the terminator. This helps to confirm the general process.\n*   **Example 3:**  An orange network connects to magenta/grey blocks. This follows the same dominant color rule. It also suggests that the original network color is preserved at junction points.\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation:**\n\nMy hypothesis is that the network color propagates outward from the terminator regions to the junction, taking on the dominant color of the terminator.  Junctions will need a special rule to either preserve the original color or reflect the conflicting inputs.\n\n**Refinement of Logic:**\n\nI need to precisely define the \u2018dominant\u2019 color (most frequent). I will also need to formalize the junction behavior, maybe using a Voronoi diagram or a distance-based method.\n*   **Voronoi and Distance:** Using distance from the terminator, nodes that can be reached by only one color, take that color. Nodes where distances from multiple colors match, remain the original skeleton color.\n\n**Algorithm Design and Test Input Focus:**\n\nThe test input has a background, a \u2018network\u2019 color (let\u2019s assume it is 4), and some \u2018objects\u2019 of mixed colors.\n\n1.  **Parse and Identify:** Define the background, skeleton (network), and object colors.\n2.  **Network and Source Identification:** Find the connected component of network (4) and identify the areas connected to the colored block (\u2018Source regions\u2019).\n3.  **Flood Fill/Propagate Colors:**  Use a flood-fill from each source region, with the target color.\n4.  **Conflicts, Boundaries, Junctions:**\n    -Where the colors meet, and the distances are equal, treat that as a \u2018junction\u2019 or boundary. These nodes retain the original network color.\n    -Refine the color.\n\n**Applying the Hypothesis to the Test Input:**\n\nI will look at the exact locations of the network connections (the 4s) to the blocks of colors (3 and 2) in the test input. There will be one on the left, one on the right, and the colors will propagate. The center will be the vertical spine. The colors will meet in the middle and the spine remains a boundary.\n\n**Refinement and Grid-Based Implementation**\n\nI will now generate the output grid.\n*   The Vertical line at 12-14.\n*   From observation, anything to the left of column 12 becomes 3.\n*   From observation, anything to the right of column 14 becomes 2.\n*   Keep the center 12-14 skeleton as is.\n*   There's also some small rule.\n\nFinal Test is, if I apply it as so:\n- `3`: Left side\n- `2`: Right Side\n- `4`: Stay as is.\n\nIt will produce the result grid.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided examples and the test input, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify the Components:**\n    *   **Background:** The dominant filler color (e.g., `9` in Ex 1, `0` in Ex 2, `8` in Ex 3). In the Test Input, the background is `6` (Magenta).\n    *   **Skeleton/Network:** A connected structure of lines of a specific color (e.g., `8` in Ex 1, `5` in Ex 2, `7` in Ex 3). In the Test Input, the skeleton is `4` (Yellow).\n    *   **Colored Blocks/Terminals:** Regions of other colors that touch the skeleton. These serve as \"sources\" for the new colors. In the Test Input, there are regions of `3` (Green) and `2` (Red).\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic (Color Propagation):**\n    *   The skeleton pixels change color based on the \"Colored Block\" they are connected to.\n    *   **Source Identification:**\n        *   The **Left side** of the grid contains large blocks of **Green (3)** pixels touching the skeleton.\n        *   The **Right side** of the grid contains large blocks of **Red (2)** pixels touching the skeleton.\n    *   **Propagation Rule:**\n        *   Skeleton pixels (`4`) that are part of the branches leading to the Green (`3`) blocks become **Green (`3`)**.\n        *   Skeleton pixels (`4`) that are part of the branches leading to the Red (`2`) blocks become **Red (`2`)**.\n    *   **Junction/Spine Preservation:**\n        *   Where the branches from different colored sources meet (the \"center\" or \"spine\" of the network), the skeleton color is **preserved**.\n        *   In the Test Input, the skeleton forms a central vertical \"ladder\" or spine roughly between columns 12 and 14.\n        *   Branches extending to the left (Column < 12) turn `3`.\n        *   Branches extending to the right (Column > 14) turn `2`.\n        *   The central vertical structure (Columns 12, 13, 14) remains `4`.\n\n3.  **Applying to Test Input:**\n    *   Iterate through the grid.\n    *   If a pixel is `4` (Skeleton):\n        *   If it is in the **Left** region (Column index < 12): Change to `3`.\n        *   If it is in the **Right** region (Column index > 14): Change to `2`.\n        *   If it is in the **Center** region (Column index 12, 13, 14): Keep as `4`.\n    *   All other pixels (Background `6`, Blocks `2`, `3`) remain unchanged.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n\n*   **Left Region (Cols 0-11):** All `4`s become `3`.\n*   **Center Region (Cols 12-14):** All `4`s stay `4`.\n*   **Right Region (Cols 15-29):** All `4`s become `2`.\n\nThis effectively colors the left tributaries green, the right tributaries red, and keeps the central main artery yellow.\n\noutput:\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,4,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_8_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Problem Understanding and Initial Approach:**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this ARC problem. The task seems to involve grids where we need to figure out how colored pipes connect and transform based on surrounding regions. My first impression is that there's a recurring pattern: a network of pipes, usually in a single color, leading to rectangular regions that are filled with patterns of other colors.\n\n**Early Observations and Analyses:**\n\nLooking at the examples, I can see that the pipe color seems to change and take on a dominant color from the regions it connects to. There's usually a junction point where the pipes meet. Analyzing Example 1 helps a lot: We've got a maroon background and teal (8) pipes connecting to regions with a checkerboard of green (3) and yellow (4). In the output, those pipes change colors to reflect what those regions seem to contain the most of. The top-left region's pipes turned green, the top-right and bottom-left turned yellow. It appears the color change is related to the regions' color composition.\n\n**Developing a Rule and Testing It:**\n\nI'm thinking the main logic has to do with identifying the network, the background, and those connected regions, and then seeing how the pipe color is determined by the regions. The rule seems to be: The pipe gets the color of the most frequent non-background pixel type in the connected region, but how about the pixels right at the intersection? I noticed in Example 1, the pipes meet at a central point. I'm going to have to make sure to account for that.\n\n**Refining the Rule:**\n\nI have to pinpoint the rule, how a pipe pixel gets \"connected\" and how to find this dominant or characteristic color. The flooding, I am considering this approach to identify the boundaries where different parts of the network meet. Example 2's structure made things much clearer. Identifying the regions and their associated colors, and then \"flooding\" out along the pipe network using the majority color of the region it connects to. Where there is overlap, those pixels should retain the original pipe color.\n\n**Edge Cases and Test Input Analysis:**\n\nThe examples are helpful, but the test input looks a bit different. My plan is to start by identifying what are the \"pipes\" and the \"background\". I saw a pattern of yellow (4) lines connecting to clusters of red (2) and green (3) pixels. The background is a magenta (6). So now I'm thinking, are the pipe segments connected? Are they split up?\n\n**Developing the Test Input Solution:**\n\nI'm getting closer, so I figured, maybe the yellow lines are not a continuous network, or maybe that the 4 value is only the structure boundary. In the examples, there's always one big structure. Since the grid width is even, the logic needs to address this, and I'm guessing the key to solving this is going to rely on a symmetry or proximity to the borders of the grid: the boundary pixels.\n\n**Finalized Solution:**\n\nOkay, I believe I've got it. I decided that, for the test input, the best way to handle the test input is to categorize all yellow pixels (4s) as the pipe system. Since the problem is symmetric, I can decide which half of the pipe structure gets which color.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n1. Identify connected yellow (4) pixels.\n2. If the 4 is mostly on the left, it should turn green(3). If the 4 is mostly on the right, it should turn red(2).\n3. The key is now: how to deal with the middle part that touches both halves? The way that the examples set up their structures showed that the touching points must stay yellow. This means: If a pixel is in a connecting zone, then it stays yellow.\n\nTo implement this: I can just check the column position. If the column is less than the center index, set to 3. If greater than, set to 2. If equal, keep as 4. Now, I have solved it!\n\n\nThe goal of this task is to simulate a \"fluid propagation\" or \"network coloring\" process. \n\n**Logic Discovery:**\n1.  **Identify Components:**\n    *   **Background:** The most frequent color in the grid (e.g., Maroon in Ex 1, Black in Ex 2, Light Blue in Ex 3, Magenta/6 in Test).\n    *   **Pipes:** A network of pixels of a single distinct color (e.g., Teal in Ex 1, Grey in Ex 2, Orange in Ex 3, Yellow/4 in Test) that connects different parts of the grid.\n    *   **Regions:** Clumps of non-background, non-pipe pixels located at the endpoints or corners of the pipe network. These regions have specific colors (e.g., Green/Yellow in Ex 1, Blue/Red in Ex 2).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   The pipe network transports the color of the connected regions.\n    *   **Source:** Each region acts as a source of its dominant color.\n    *   **Propagation:** The color flows from the region into the connected pipe pixels.\n    *   **Junctions:** Where flows from different colored regions meet, they stop. The pipe pixels at the interface (or the geometric center of the junction) retain their original color to serve as a buffer or mixing point.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Analysis of Test Grid:**\n    *   **Background:** 6 (Magenta).\n    *   **Pipes:** 4 (Yellow).\n    *   **Regions:**\n        *   **Top-Left Quadrant:** Contains a large region of 3s (Green).\n        *   **Bottom-Left Quadrant:** Contains a region of 3s (Green) mixed with some 2s, but dominantly Green in the connected main structure.\n        *   **Top-Right Quadrant:** Contains a region of 2s (Red).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Quadrant:** Contains a region of 2s (Red).\n    *   **Structure:** The pipe network consists of disconnected or loosely connected structures dominating the left and right sides, with a central connection point.\n        *   The pipes on the **Left** side (Columns 0-14) connect to the Green (3) regions.\n        *   The pipes on the **Right** side (Columns 16-29) connect to the Red (2) regions.\n        *   There is a **Bridge** in the center (Row 15, Columns 14-16) consisting of `4, 4, 4`.\n\n2.  **Execution:**\n    *   All pipe pixels (`4`) located in the left half of the grid (Columns < 15) turn **Green (3)**.\n    *   All pipe pixels (`4`) located in the right half of the grid (Columns > 15) turn **Red (2)**.\n    *   The pipe pixels exactly in the middle or forming the junction buffer must remain **Yellow (4)** to prevent the two colors from touching (following the pattern in Example 2 where the junction color separates the branches).\n    *   Specifically, at the bridge on Row 15:\n        *   (15, 14) is on the left -> becomes 3.\n        *   (15, 16) is on the right -> becomes 2.\n        *   (15, 15) is the buffer -> stays 4.\n\n3.  **Result:**\n    *   The yellow lattice on the left turns green.\n    *   The yellow lattice on the right turns red.\n    *   The central-most yellow pixels (column 15) remain yellow.\n\nOutput Grid Calculation:\nReplacing 4s with 3s where column index < 15.\nReplacing 4s with 2s where column index > 15.\nLeaving 4s as 4 where column index ==

Each grid has a \"line\" color that forms a network dividing regions (8 in Ex1, 5 in Ex2, 7 in Ex3)\n2. Some regions contain \"pattern\" colors (3,4 in Ex1; 1,2 in Ex2; 5,6 in Ex3)\n3. The transformation \"floods\" the pattern colors along the lines extending from their source regions\n4. Where lines from different pattern regions meet, there's a small junction that remains in the original line color\n5. The center cell of the junction gets colored with one of the pattern colors\n\n**For the test input:**\n- Line color: 4\n- Background: 6  \n- Pattern colors: 3 (dominant in top-left and bottom-left regions) and 2 (dominant in top-right and bottom-right regions)\n- Main junction: rows 11-13, cols 12-14\n\n**Transformation rules:**\n- Lines connecting to left-side patterns (cols ~0-11) \u2192 3\n- Lines connecting to right-side patterns (cols ~15-29) \u2192 2\n- Junction stays as 4, with center cell becoming

\u201cpipe/maze\u201d network** in a single color (this is the only thing that changes).\n3. **Several attached \u201crooms\u201d** made from *two* other colors mixed together.\n\nThe rule is:\n\n- For every mixed-color room (a connected component made only of the two room-colors), determine its **majority color** (the color that appears more inside that room).\n- Use that majority color as the room\u2019s \u201clabel\u201d.\n- Now **recolor the pipe network**: for each pipe cell, look at the shortest path **along the pipe cells only** to the nearest labeled room-attachment point (pipe cells adjacent to the room).\n  - If the nearest label is unique, recolor the pipe cell to that label color.\n  - If there is a tie (equally close to both label colors), **leave the pipe cell unchanged** (it stays the original pipe color).  \nThis creates a small neutral frontier where the two color \u201cwaves\u201d meet (as in the examples).\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n- The pipe/maze color is **4** (it forms the connected network).\n- The two room-colors are **2 and 3** (they form the mixed blocks).\n- There are four mixed blocks:\n  - Top-left: majority **3**\n  - Top-right small block: majority **2**\n  - Bottom-left: majority **3**\n  - Bottom-right: majority **2**\n- Run the distance propagation along the **4**-cells and recolor them to **3** or **2**; ties remain **4** (here that leaves three neutral cells).\n\n### Output

straightforward, but requires careful pattern recognition.** I need to transform a grid based on provided examples, focusing on a \"corridor\" within the grid. The hints are crucial: only the maze-like structure changes, it's recolored with two existing colors, and there's a small central junction that stays the original corridor color.\n\nI'm starting by analyzing the examples. Example 1 seems to have a path that links differently colored blocks or \"rooms\".  It looks like the corridor is a gradient \u2013 parts near one block take that block's color. There's a \"meeting point\" in the middle of the corridor where the new colors meet. The key seems to be the color adjacency to the corridor.\n\nExample 2 reinforces this. The corridor gets colored based on the colors \"at its ends,\" with the meeting point staying the original color.\n\nExample 3 is a bit tricky since the colors are less distinct and adjacency is less obvious. It's becoming clearer that the corridor always has two endpoints and is connected to other things via a \"gate\".\n\nMy hypothesis is crystallizing: Identify the \"maze\" or \"path\" color. Determine the two \"target\" colors \u2013 usually the dominant colors of the separate grid regions. Find where the \"path\" touches or is close to the \"target\" colors. Use those as \"seed points\" for a flood fill from both target colors. The meeting point (where the \"waves\" collide) stays the original path color. It seems the key is to calculate distances. This distance approach is what allows us to identify the \"meeting point\" in the corridor. We have to be mindful that the connection isn't always direct, and we need to account for possible 1-cell gaps or \"gates\" that act as access points.\n\nThe test input seems to confirm this approach. I see a similar grid structure, with distinct colored regions and a path connecting them. It seems I can \"visualize\" a multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the ends of the corridor and propagating the colors from the respective regions, and applying the distance check is essential to create that tiny region where the original \"path\" color remains. In fact, if the distance to both starting colors is roughly the same, that's where the original color will remain.\n\nNow I have a step-by-step algorithm: Identify the path color, Identify the two fill colors, Find seed points (adjacent cells or \"entrances\" to regions), BFS with color propagation and the key \"distance-based junction\" logic. If the distance from one seed is lower than the other, give that cell that color. If it is within 1 cell, or at equal distance, keep the cell the original maze color.\n\nI need to apply this to the test input by carefully calculating the geodesic distances of each path cell to the two seed color zones. The crucial operation is a BFS from the source cell. It is key to make sure I don't overlook any hidden adjacent structures. Then, by applying the distance logic, and outputting the \"final\" coloring I should solve the problem!\n\n\nTo solve this task, I need to identify the \"corridor\" structure in the grid, determine which two colors it should be recolored into, and find the meeting point where the original color remains.\n\n**1. Analysis of Input:**\n- **Corridor Color:** The integer `4` (yellow) forms a complex, connected structure (a maze or corridor) running through the grid.\n- **Background/Walls:** The integers `6` (magenta) form large blocks acting as walls.\n- **Region Colors:**\n    - The **Top-Left** region contains a mix of `3` (green) and `2` (red), but the `4`-corridor in this area (specifically the vertical shaft at column 9) is directly adjacent to `3`s.\n    - The **Bottom-Right** region also contains `3` and `2`, but the `4`-corridor in this area (specifically the vertical shaft at column 14, rows 21-29) is directly adjacent to `2`s.\n    - Additionally, a `4`-segment at `(4, 26)` in the top-right touches a `2`.\n- **Logic:** The corridor connects a \"Green (3) Domain\" to a \"Red (2) Domain\". The corridor should be flood-filled with `3` from the green side and `2` from the red side. The cells where these two floods meet (are equidistant or nearly equidistant) will remain `4`.\n\n**2. Transformation Logic (Mental Simulation):**\n- **Source 3:** The top part of the corridor (column 9, and the bridge on row 4) is connected to the `3`s. These areas and their downstream paths will turn to `3`.\n- **Source 2:** The bottom-right parts of the corridor (column 14 lower half, column 21/26 areas) are connected to the `2`s. These will turn to `2`.\n- **Meeting Point:**\n    - Tracing the distances:\n        - The \"3\" flood comes down column 9, across the row 7 bridge to column 12, down column 12, and across the row 11 bridge to column 14.\n        - The \"2\" flood comes up column 14 from the bottom.\n        - Another \"2\" flood comes from the right side (row 10) towards column 14.\n    - The meeting point is around **Row 10, Column 14**.\n    - Calculating geodesic distances (D3 for distance from green source, D2 for distance from red source):\n        - At `(10, 14)`: D3 $\\approx$ 10, D2 $\\approx$ 11.

My initial impression is that it involves transforming a grid of numbers, which I'm assuming are colors, into a new grid, all while following some pretty specific rules.  I've got a detailed thought process to ensure I understand these rules.\n\nFirst, I need to get a handle on what the input and output look like. The input is a grid of integers, which I'm taking to be colors, and the output is a modified version of the same grid. I'm also dealing with several hints. The key constraint is that I need to provide a complete, final grid, along with my thinking process.\n\nLooking at the hints, there's a recurring pattern: a \"corridor\" is the thing that's going to get edited. This corridor is made of a single connected component of a specific color and always touches a few differently colored regions. I need to keep the \"corners\" of the grid untouched, and the corridor is being recolored using only *two* colors that are already present in the input. Also, this recoloring forms continuous segments.\n\nAlright, let's dive into Example 1. It is a 16x16 grid with three colors: green, yellow, azure, and maroon. The top-left, top-right, and bottom-right corners, are all 3/4 (green/yellow), and the bottom-left is mainly 9 (maroon). The background is 9 or 8. The \"corridor\" here is a maze made of color 8 (azure). It connects these corner areas. In the output, the corners are largely the same. The corridor, color 8, is now colored with green and yellow, colors 3 and 4. Specifically, the corridor pixels connected to the top-left section turn green, the ones attached to the top-right become yellow, and the bottom section also becomes yellow. The hint says there's a \"junction\" of the original corridor color, which is 8, remaining in the middle. So, a small chunk of azure 8s stays put. My hunch is the corridor works as a bridge between separate \"sources,\" and each source has its characteristic color. I suspect the corridor gets filled with the color it touches until meeting at a junction that retains its original color.\n\nNow, let's move to Example 2. It is a 10x10 grid with four colors: black (0), gray (5), red (2), blue (1). The background is black, the top-right is red, and the lower-left is a mix of red and blue. The corridor is gray (5). It connects the red top-right section to the lower-left. In the output, the corridor is a mix of red and blue, depending on where it connects. It's clear that the gray corridor gets filled with red (2) and blue (1).  Now I check and see that the output coloring corresponds to the initial color of the region. The part linked to the red top-right becomes red, and the gray parts connected to the blue/red mix become blue, but there's a section of gray in the middle where everything crosses. My theory now is: a corridor connecting different \"source\" regions.\n\nLet's dissect Example 3. Here, there are magenta (6), orange (7), azure (8), and gray (5) colors.  The \"corridor\" is orange. There are large azure blocks, and blocks of magenta, and the orange corridor winds around. Let's look at the output. In the output, the corridor (orange) color is gone and replaced by magenta (6) and gray (5). I'm guessing the \"corridor\" is color 7, given the hint from the previous two examples. The path connected to the 6-region becomes 6. The one touching 5/6 becomes 5. This solidifies the \"two colors\" pattern.\n\nAfter analyzing these three examples, I've got some rules forming:\n1.  **Corridor:** I've got to find the connected component (a specific color) that connects distinct regions.\n2.  **Regions:** The corridor must touch different regions (groups of other colors).\n3.  **Colors:** Each region has a \"fill color\". The two active colors in the puzzle are present in these regions. The corridor is filled with the color from the region it connects. If multiple colors are present, there seems to be a predominant fill color, for example, the majority is the fill color. The central junction is left untouched.\n\nSo, in Example 1, the corridor is 8, and the regions have 3/4.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid by recoloring a specific \"corridor\" component. Based on the solved examples, the rules are:\n1.  **Identify the Corridor:** The corridor is the large, connected component of a specific color (distinct from the background and the large corner regions). In the test input, the background is 6 (magenta) and the corridor is 4 (yellow).\n2.  **Identify Sources:** The corridor connects two or more regions of different colors. We need to identify these colors.\n    *   **Top-Left Region:** A large block consisting mainly of 3s (green) with some 2s. The corridor touches this region at the top-left (e.g., Row 9, Cols 0-8). Thus, one fill color is **3**.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Region:** A large block consisting mainly of 2s (red) with some 3s. The corridor touches this region at the bottom-right (e.g., Cols 14, Row 22+). Thus, the second fill color is **2**.\n3.  **Recolor based on Proximity (Flood Fill):** The corridor should be filled with the color of the region it is closest to (graph distance).\n    *   The \"3\" color floods from the Top-Left connection.\n    *   The \"2\" color floods from the Bottom-Right connection (and effectively the Bottom-Left connection as well, which is closer to the \"2\" source in the corridor topology).\n4.  **Preserve Junction:** The boundary where the two flood fills meet should remain the original corridor color (4).\n\n**Tracing the Path and Junction:**\n*   **Path from Top-Left (3):** Enters at Row 0-9, Col 9. It flows down Col 9 to Row 11.\n*   **Path from Bottom-Right (2):** Enters at the bottom (Col 14). Flows up Col 14 to Row 12, then connects to Row 11 via Col 12.\n*   **The Meeting Point:** The two paths converge at the horizontal segment on **Row 11**.\n    *   The \"3\" flow reaches (11, 9).\n    *   The \"2\" flow reaches (11, 12).\n    *   The pixels between them are (11, 10) and (11, 11).\n    *   Calculating distances:\n        *   (11, 9) is adjacent to the Top source path.\n        *   (11, 12) is adjacent to the Bottom source path.\n        *   (11, 10) and (11, 11) are the equidistant midpoint.\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   All 4s \"upstream\" of (11, 10) become **3**. This includes the top vertical segment and the left part of Row 11.\n    *   All 4s \"downstream\" of (11, 11) become **2**. This includes the right part of Row 11, the entire bottom structure, and side branches connected to the bottom (like the Bottom-Left branch).\n    *   The pixels at **Row 11, Col 10** and **Row 11, Col 11** remain **4**.\n\n**Applying the Transformation:**\n*   **Rows 0-10:** All 4s become 3.\n*   **Row 11:**\n    *   4s at cols 5, 7, 8, 9 become 3.\n    *   4s at cols 10, 11 remain 4.\n    *   4s at cols 12 through 20 become 2.\n*   **Row 12:**\n    *   4s at cols 5, 6, 7 (connected to the left part of Row 11) become 3.\n    *   4s at cols 12, 13, 14 (connected to the right part of Row 11) become 2.\n*   **Rows 13-29:** All 4s become 2.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n4,4,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,4,4,4,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n      2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,3,2\n      2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,2,3,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n      2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      4,4,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,4,4,4,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,2,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      3,2,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n      4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"21\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_5_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this puzzle, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples:\n\n1. **Identify the components**: Each grid has:\n   - A background color (9 in Ex1, 0 in Ex2, 8 in Ex3 \u2192 **6** in test)\n   - A corridor color forming a maze structure (8 in Ex1, 5 in Ex2, 7 in Ex3 \u2192 **4** in test)\n   - Two region colors in corner blocks (3,4 in Ex1; 1,2 in Ex2; 5,6 in Ex3 \u2192 **3,2** in test)\n\n2. **The transformation**:\n   - The corridor gets recolored based on which region it connects to\n   - Corridors connecting to the top-left region (color 3) become 3\n   - Corridors connecting to the bottom-right region (color 2) become 2\n   - A small central junction (3\u00d73 area) remains in the original corridor color (4), except the center cell which takes a region color\n\n3. **For the test input**:\n   - Top-left region (rows 0-8, cols 0-8): mostly 3s\n   - Bottom-right region (rows 21-29, cols 15-29): mostly 2s\n   - The junction is at rows 11-13, cols 12-14\n   - Small corner regions (top-right with 2,3 pattern, bottom-left with 3,2 pattern) maintain their internal values\n\n4. **Determining connectivity**:\n   - Corridors above/left of junction \u2192 connected to 3 region \u2192 become 3\n   - Corridors below/right of junction \u2192 connected to 2 region \u2192 become 2\n   - Junction outer ring stays 4, center becomes 3\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,3,3,3,3\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3\n      2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,3,2\n      2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,3,3,3,3\n      2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      2,2,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n      2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"22\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred rule (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Identify the \u201ccorridor/maze\u201d color**: it is the single large connected component that is *not* the background and is the only structure that changes.  \n   - In the test grid, the dominant background is **6**.  \n   - The large connected maze component is **4**.  \n   - The only other (non-background) colors are **2** and **3** \u2192 these are the **two recoloring colors**.\n\n2. **Find the unique solid 3\u00d73 block of corridor color** (all 9 cells are the corridor color).  \n   This is the \u201ccentral junction.\u201d  \n   - In the test input, the 3\u00d73 all-4 block is at **rows 12\u201314 and columns 13\u201315** (1-based indexing).\n\n3. **Preserve the junction boundary**:\n   - Keep the **8 perimeter cells** of that 3\u00d73 block as the original corridor color (**4**).\n   - Recolor the **center cell** of the 3\u00d73 block to the **majority** of the two recoloring colors (2 vs 3).  \n     Here, **2** is clearly more frequent overall \u2192 the center becomes **2**.\n\n4. **Recolor the rest of the corridor (all other 4-cells)**:\n   - Treat the preserved 3\u00d73 perimeter as a separator and flood-fill the remaining corridor.  \n   - The corridor splits into two sides:  \n     - The side connected to the **top-left region** (mostly **3**) becomes **3**.  \n     - The other side becomes **2**.\n\nAll non-corridor cells stay unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,2,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n      2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n      2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n      2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,2,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      2,2,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n      2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"23\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Identify the background color** as the most frequent value in the grid.\n2. **Identify the \u201ccorridor/maze\u201d color** as the single large connected component that is edited (in all examples, exactly one non-background color forms this big connected maze).\n3.

Let's dig in. I need to figure out the underlying logic from the examples and test it.\n\n*   **Example 1 Analysis:** I'm seeing a grid-like structure with a maroon background (`9`), and what I initially assumed was the background. But the description talks about a \"Lattice\" \u2013 orthogonal lines. The input has regions (`3` and `4`) separated by lines (`8`). Ah, so `9` is the \"interior fill\" with noise (`3` and `4`). The lattice is color `8`. It looks like the lattice lines divide the image into compartments, and the outputs transform the lattice colors depending on adjacent regions. I need to map the \"dominant\" colors.\n\n    The \"Transformation Description\" gives a clue, too: detect lattice, label colors, assign labels to the compartments. Then, recolor the lattice. Ah, in example one, the vertical line (col 4) is between a mix of 3,4 and a main 9-region. The horizontal line (row 4) is between these 3-4 mix and 9. It seems like the line color changes to be \"non-9\" label, if it is \"non-9\" on either sides. So it is becoming `3` and `4`. So the lattice is `8`, and the rule is to replace the lattice with the \"non-background\" label of the adjacent compartments.\n\n    I need to think about the compartments. I see that the original lattice lines are a little blurred. The lattice color seems to change. Horizontal at rows 4 and 8. Vertical at col 4, and col 11. It's not a perfectly uniform lattice. Also, the description suggests the lattice can be \"segmented\". So the `8` is key.\n\n    Also, it becomes the \"noise\" or \"dominant\" compartment label (interior fill).\n\n*   **Example 2 Analysis:** Now, I move to Ex 2. This has a background `0`, lattice `5`, and label colors `1` and `2`. Here, the lattice `5` seems straightforward, creating different rectangular compartments. But there is a line `5`, but it seems that some `5`s are in the compartments too, so the compartments are not all rectangular? I must remember what does \"segmented\" mean. The Transformation hints: \"Recolor the lattice... keep where two labels\". So I need to verify that is the logic. In Example 2 output, lines (col 7 and row 3) change into labels.\n\n    So, here the vertical line at col 7 (rows 0-2) splits an Empty and Label `2` (the output becomes `2`). Also, vertical line at col 7 (4-6) has no clear changes, since that region is `0`. Horizontal lines are at row 3 (cols 4-9) that contains a label (`2`) and empty. The output shows `0`s (empty). That is correct! Then row 7 (0-2) and (8-9). Below is 1, so lattice becomes `1`. Also what is going on at C4 (rows 4-6, cols 0-2), there are 5s? Output says 1s! And that is because adjacent region 7 is 1?\n\n    Also, the description of \"segmented lattice lines\". If \"noise\" occurs within the compartment, it should be still considered part of lattice. Output becomes all the non-background, `1`, and other area `0`. So to recap, if I look at line segments, and its neighborhoods, each line color is based on the region \"noise\" to the side of the lines, if the neighborhoods are the same or the only noise. However, it seems like some are empty, then it takes the color to the \"labeled area\", so that is correct.\n\n*   **Example 3 and Test Input Analysis:** Example 3 has many colors and doesn't clarify much. So, back to the test input.\n\n    The Test input shows `3`, `4`, `6`, and `2`. I can immediately identify the lattice (`4`). The test input has non-uniform lattice, so what is happening with the lattices is the important rule. I think 4 is the lattice. The task is to define the rule.\n\n    I see that Row 9 (index 9) shows `4`s. Col 9 shows `4`. It is not always straight. So there are some non-uniform lattice areas, as the \"lattice can vary\". So this means I need to classify the non-4s into the rectangular regions (Compartments). There are large blocks.\n\n*   \n\nTo solve this ARC task, we need to analyze the input image to identify the \"lattice\" structure and the distinct regions (compartments) it separates. Based on the provided examples and the test input, here is the step-by-step logical derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Lattice Color:**\n    *   Scanning the grid, we see a network of lines formed by the color `4` (yellow).\n    *   There is a prominent horizontal line at Row 9 and a vertical line at Column 9.\n    *   Other lines appear in the bottom-right quadrant (Row 20, Column 14).\n    *   Thus, the lattice color is `4`.\n\n2.  **Identify Regions and Labels:**\n    *   We look for the distinct regions enclosed or separated by the lattice.\n    *   **Top-Left (Region A):** Spanning roughly (0-8, 0-8). The dominant color is `3` (green), with some sparse `2` (red) noise. The label for this region is `3`.\n    *   **Top-Right (Region B):** Spanning roughly (0-8, 10-29). The interior is filled with `6` (magenta). The label is `6`.\n    *   **Bottom-Right (Region C):** Spanning roughly (21-29, 15-29). The interior is filled with `2` (red). The label is `2`.\n    *   **Background/Other:** The rest of the grid (Top-Right, Middle areas, much of Bottom-Left) is filled with `6`. Given its prevalence and the behavior in previous examples (where the most common color acts as a background), `6` serves as the background color.\n\n3.  **Determine Transformation Rules:**\n    *   The goal is to recolor the lattice pixels (`4`).\n    *   **Rule 1 (Label Adjacency):** If a lattice pixel is adjacent to a non-background label (`3` or `2`), it changes to that label color. This effectively expands the \"colored\" regions into their boundaries.\n    *   **Rule 2 (Background Adjacency):** If a lattice pixel is only adjacent to the background color (`6`) or other lattice pixels that are surrounded by background, it changes to the background color (`6`).\n    *   **Rule 3 (Junctions):** Junctions (intersections of lattice lines) follow the dominant non-background neighbor. For example, the crossing at (9,9) touches the `3` region, so it becomes `3`. The junction at (20,14) connects the `2` region boundaries, so it becomes `2`.\n    *   **Hierarchy:** `3` and `2` (Labels) > `6` (Background).\n\n4.  **Apply Transformation to Test Input:**\n    *   **Top-Left Boundary:**\n        *   The vertical line segment at Column 9 (Rows 0-9) is adjacent to the `3` region on the left. It changes to `3`.\n        *   The horizontal line segment at Row 9 (Cols 0-9) is adjacent to the `3` region above. It changes to `3`.\n        *   The intersection at (9,9) touches the `3` region. It changes to `3`.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Boundary:**\n        *   The horizontal line segment at Row 20 (Cols 15-29) is adjacent to the `2` region below. It changes to `2`.\n        *   The vertical line segment at Column 14 (Rows 21-29) is adjacent to the `2` region on the right. It changes to `2`.\n        *   The intersection at (20,14) connects these boundaries and is diagonally adjacent to `2`s. It changes to `2`.\n    *   **Background Boundaries:**\n        *   The horizontal line segment at Row 9 (Cols 10-29) separates two `6` regions. It changes to `6`.\n        *   The vertical line segment at Column 9 (Rows 10-29) separates two `6` regions. It changes to `6`.\n        *   Vertical segment Col 14 (Rows 0-20) is surrounded by `6`.

First, I'm trying to get a handle on what the task *actually* wants me to do. It looks like I'm dealing with a grid-based puzzle where I need to recolor a lattice structure based on the contents of the regions the lattice creates.  I'm seeing grids, background colors, lattice lines (which are these thin lines that act as boundaries), and compartments (the areas inside those lattice boundaries). The problem states that the interior of these compartments have a distinct color, or maybe some kind of noise pattern. The description implies that I need to change these lattice line colors according to the contents, and from some examples, I understand there are labels for each region.\n\n**Initial Exploration:** I'm starting by analyzing the examples, particularly Example 1. It seems complex. I'm focusing on identifying the lattice color and the colors of regions. In Example 1, the background color is a kind of teal, and the lattice is also of the same color. There are rectangular regions with colors like 3,4 and those seem to be the labels I am looking for. I also realize that the lattice lines are not as simple or solid as they seem. It's not a solid line of the same color, but more of a segmented structure. I need to be careful with this, as it could mean the task has some hidden details.\n\n**Decoding the Lattice:** I'm rereading the transformation logic in the prompt. I have to *detect* the lattice - and the example description specifies it's orthogonal, intersecting lines. This leads me to believe the seemingly incomplete lattice in the examples is actually the core structure. It's just being obscured or interrupted by noise within a particular region.  I'm thinking:  \"I have to *find* and *reconstruct* the grid, *even* if it's not a solid line.\" From the examples, I gather that the color of a region influences the lattice color adjacent to it. For example, if a region has a dominant color, or a kind of noise color, that will change the lattice color. The lattice also has some logic related to the colors. If it's between two similar labels, it might keep its original color.\n\n**Region Labels and Boundary Logic:** My analysis of Example 1 really helped me grasp how this works. I see that the dominant interior color (or possibly the noise color, if it's there) becomes the label, and lattice boundary takes the color of the adjacent compartment. If two compartments touch, the lattice becomes the label color! I also realize some areas might only have background colors, which might be some form of a \"label\". In Example 3, if a region is only background, the lattice color changes to the background color.\n\n**Test Input Dive:** I'm moving on to the Test Input now to build a solution. I'm carefully analyzing its details and the lattice structure. I see different colors, and I have to *identify* the compartments and the dominant or noise colors to determine the labels. I need to figure out which color is background, which one is lattice, and if any of the labels, colors 2 and 3, belong to which region.  I'm trying to identify a lattice based on visual inspection and color distribution, because the prompt suggests a specific color in the prompt.\n\n**Applying the Rules:** Now I'm synthesizing the rules and getting really clear on the logic: 1. I need to *locate the lattice*. 2. I have to assign labels to each compartment. 3. I recolor the lattice, according to its adjacent compartments. Based on the rules, the lattice will be influenced by the adjacent label - I need to be *sure* about the order and the way the regions are located.\n\n**Junctions and Refinement:** I have to apply these rules at \"junctions.\" (Where the lattice lines cross or meet). Based on the 3x3 junction rule, the center is recolored, and outer eight pixels stay. So I have to find these junctions in the examples and make sure I know how to apply them. After finding and refining the rules, I made sure all those details are in a single section.\n\n**Building a Strategy:** I'm visualizing the Test Input and identifying the regions and the lattice. I'm going to create a mapping of the lattice based on its neighbors, and determine how each lattice pixel transforms to a new color. I've broken the test input into regions, and I am mapping those locations now. I'm also doing a step-by-step trace of how the rules influence each part of the lattice to create the final output. The key is to figure out the 3x3 lattice, and correctly map out regions in the Test Input so I know the labels and how they will impact the lattice. My current hypothesis is: \"\n\nThe solution involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Grid Structure:**\n    *   **Lattice:** The grid contains a lattice structure made of the color **4** (yellow).\n    *   **Background:** The dominant background color is **6** (magenta).\n    *   **Labels:** There are distinct regions filled with other colors:\n        *   **Region 1 (Top-Left):** Dominant color **3** (green). Defined by boundaries x=0-9, y=0-9.\n        *   **Region 2 (Bottom-Right):** Dominant color **2** (red). Large region starting around row 21 and column 15.\n        *   **Region 3 (Small Bottom-Left):** Dominant color **3** (green). A small block at rows 23-25, cols 0-1.\n        *   **Region 4 (Small Top-Right):** Dominant color **2** (red). A small C-shaped enclosure at row 5, cols 27-29.\n\n2.  **Determine Transformation Logic:**\n    *   The goal is to recolor the lattice lines (4) based on the label of the adjacent compartment.\n    *   **Rule 1:** If a lattice segment borders a labeled region (3 or 2), it takes that region's color.\n    *   **Rule 2:** If a lattice segment borders only the background (6), it takes the background color (6).\n    *   **Rule 3:** Connected lattice segments adjacent to a label effectively \"absorb\" that label.\n\n3.  **Apply Logic to Specific Lattice Segments:**\n\n    *   **Around Top-Left Region (Label 3):**\n        *   The horizontal line at **Row 9** (cols 0-9) borders the 3-region. **Change 4 to 3**.\n        *   The vertical line at **Col 9** (rows 0-9) borders the 3-region. **Change 4 to 3**.\n\n    *   **Around Bottom-Left Small Region (Label 3):**\n        *   The lattice enclosing this 2x3 block consists of **Row 22 (cols 0-2)**, **Row 26 (cols 0-2)**, and **Col 2 (rows 23-25)**.\n        *   Also, **Row 21 (cols 0-2)** is a lattice layer on top of Row 22. Being connected and adjacent to the region (via Row 22), it also changes.\n        *   **Change these 4s to 3**.\n\n    *   **Around Bottom-Right Region (Label 2):**\n        *   The horizontal boundary is **Row 20** (cols 16-29). It borders the 2-region below. **Change 4 to 2**.\n        *   The vertical boundary is **Col 14** (rows 21-29). It borders the 2-region to the right. **Change 4 to 2**.\n\n    *   **Around Top-Right Small Region (Label 2):**\n        *   The lattice enclosing this involves **Row 4 (cols 27-29)**, **Row 6 (cols 27-29)**, and **Col 26 (rows 4-6)**.\n        *   This encloses a small pocket of 2s and 3s (dominant 2). **Change these 4s to 2**.\n\n    *   **All Other Lattice Segments:**\n        *   Any remaining pixels of color 4 that are adjacent only to the background (6) or are isolated fragments within the background (e.g., in rows 10-19, or fragments in row 9/21 not touching the regions) are changed to **6**.\n\n4.  **Final Output Generation:**\n    *   Construct the grid by copying the input and applying the color changes to the lattice pixels as determined above.

model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_6_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this ARC task, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples:\n\n## Analysis of Examples\n\n1. **Lattice Color**: A single color forms orthogonal lines creating compartments (Example 1: 8, Example 2: 5, Example 3: 7)\n2. **Label Colors**: Two distinct colors appear in the compartments (Example 1: 3 & 4, Example 2: 1 & 2, Example 3: 5 & 6)\n3. **Background**: The dominant fill color (Example 1: 9, Example 2: 0, Example 3: 8)\n\n## Transformation Rules:\n- Lattice segments adjacent to labeled compartments take that label's color\n- At junctions where different labels meet, lattice stays original color\n- For 3\u00d73 all-lattice blocks: outer 8 pixels stay as lattice color, center becomes a label\n\n## Test Input Analysis:\n- **Lattice color**: 4\n- **Background**: 6  \n- **Label colors**: 3 and 2\n- **Compartments**:\n  - Top-left (rows 0-8, cols 0-8): Label 3 (dominant with 2 noise)\n  - Top-right small (rows 4-5, cols 27-29): Label 2\n  - Bottom-left (rows 22-24, cols 0-1): Label 3\n  - Bottom-right (rows 21-29, cols 15-29): Label 2\n\nThe lattice network connects all regions, with a junction area around rows 11-13, cols 12-14 where the 3-labeled network (left) meets the 2-labeled network (right).\n\nTracing the network:\n- Lattice connected to A/C (labels 3): cols 0-11 and vertical segments on left\n- Lattice connected to B/D (labels 2): cols 15+ and segments on right  \n- Junction zone: cols 12-14 at key intersections\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,2,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```\n

1\u2011cell\u2011wide straight lines and junctions.  \n   *In the test grid this is `4`.*\n\n2. **Identify the dominant background**: the most common non-lattice color filling most open areas.  \n   *Here it is `6`.*\n\n3. **Identify the two \u201cregion label\u201d colors**: the remaining non-background, non-lattice colors that appear as solid fills or as sparse noise inside compartments.  \n   *Here they are `2` and `3`.*\n\n4. **Label each compartment (each connected region of non\u2011`4` cells)** by whichever of `{2,3}` is most common inside it (noise doesn\u2019t change the compartment label).\n\n5. **Recolor lattice cells**:\n   - A lattice cell becomes the **label color** of the compartment(s) it borders if it borders **only one label**.\n   - If it borders **both labels**, keep it as lattice color `4`.\n   - If it borders **no labeled compartment** (only background compartments), keep it `4`.\n\n6. **Special junction rule**: for any **3\u00d73 block made entirely of lattice color (`4`)**, keep the **outer 8** cells as `4`, and recolor the **center** to the **globally dominant label color** (the label color that occurs more overall).  \n   *In this test, `2` is more frequent than `3`, so junction centers become `2`.*\n\nApplying these rules to the test grid recolors the boundary walls around the `3` compartments to `3`, around the `2` compartments to `2`, and changes the single 3\u00d73 all\u2011`4` junction center to `2`.\n\n---\n\n### Output

</OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- SELECT THE BEST RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1. It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
