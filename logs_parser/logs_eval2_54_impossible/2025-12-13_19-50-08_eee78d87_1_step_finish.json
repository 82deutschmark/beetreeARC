My initial thought is to analyze the examples to understand how the output is derived.\n\nAfter carefully examining Example 1, I see that the output is composed of 2x2 blocks separated by single-pixel borders. The input's 6x6 size somehow translates into 5x5 such cells in the output, hinting that the input data might represent the corners of these cells. I'm focusing on the position of a specific shape (in this case, a 'plus' shape made of green 3s) in the input to see if there's a direct mapping to some feature within the grid cells. There's also this interesting 9-based overlay I spot. It seems to highlight a central 5x5 region in the output, specifically affecting the boundaries and some inner cells.\n\nThen, I check Example 2, and the overlay is in the exact same place! This reinforces the idea that the 9-pattern is constant. Now, I'm thinking about the base pattern and its relation to the input shape and the overlay. Also, the colors 0 and 7 have a role and I need to figure out how. In Example 2, the shape is a square of 1s, and I notice that only vertical borders exist in the base pattern. In Example 3, the shape is an X of 6s, and the gridlines are present in the base pattern. Now, let's formulate this with some logic!\n\nOkay, let's try something.  Let's consider the connectivity of the special color (3, 1, and 6 in the examples). Perhaps this connectivity hints at the output texture. It seems that the shape's presence defines which kind of lines appear in the output. For example, in Example 2, the output is vertical lines, and the H shape hints to verticality. In example 3 the shape is X so a box.\n\nLet's test this! So in Example 1, 3s are a plus (+); no lines.\n\nNow, I'm going to look at some logic!\n\nI hypothesize: The presence or absence of the color in certain areas (specifically at the middle of the sides) of a 3x3 region will determine if H and V lines appear in the output. If the middle pixels on the horizontal or vertical sides are missing, lines will be drawn.\n\n*   **H-Lines**: Check for color at (2,1) and (2,3). If **present**, remove Horizontal borders. Else, keep Horizontal borders.\n*   **V-Lines**: Check for color at (1,2) and (3,2). If **present**, remove Vertical borders. Else, keep Vertical borders.\n*   The interior color is determined, too. If we have some lines, then it is 0. If we have no lines, then 7.\n\nOkay, let's now look at the test input and apply the rules:\n\n*   **Test Input**:  We've got 2s. The shape is four dots.\n\nLet's look at the shape. It's the 4 dots. It is similar to Example 3 with the 6s except it's 4 dots with no central pixel. I'm thinking, that the 4-dot shape means a solid grid will appear in the output.\n\nApplying my rule, I find that horizontal lines are needed and vertical lines are needed, because the L/R Mid and T/B Mids are missing. This means a full grid should be the pattern! Let's now apply my theory with \"center pixel determines intersection color\"\n\n*   The key is if the center is present. If the center is colored, then broken intersection. If missing, solid intersection!\n*   In the test input, it is background color. So solid intersection.\n\nNow, all I need to do is generate the solid grid and overlay the fixed 9 regions and I should be all set!\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid.\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation involves two main steps:\n1.  **Generating a Base Pattern (16x16):** The input grid contains a specific shape formed by colored pixels (non-7 values) on a background of 7s. This shape determines the \"texture\" of the output grid. The output grid represents a 5x5 array of cells (each 2x2 pixels) separated by 1-pixel wide borders.\n    *   **Logic for Borders:**\n        *   The input shape is analyzed within a 3x3 bounding box.\n        *   **Vertical Borders (Columns 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15):** These are present (color 7) unless the top-middle and bottom-middle pixels of the 3x3 shape are present. If those pixels are present (as in Example 1), the vertical borders are suppressed (color 0).\n        *   **Horizontal Borders (Rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15):** These are present (color 7) unless the left-middle and right-middle pixels of the 3x3 shape are present. If those pixels are present (as in Example 1 and Example 2), the horizontal borders are suppressed (color 0).\n        *   **Intersections:** In Examples 1, 2, and 3, the intersections of border lines (indices divisible by 3) are 0. However, in the Test Input, the \"center\" pixel of the 3x3 shape is missing (it's background 7). In the previous examples, the center pixel was always part of the shape. The missing center implies a \"solid\" connection, meaning the intersections should be filled with 7, creating a continuous grid.\n        *   **Cell Interiors:** If any borders are present, the cell interiors (the 2x2 areas) are 0. If no borders are present (Example 1), the interiors are filled with 7.\n    *   **Application to Test Input:**\n        *   The shape (color 2) is four dots at the corners of a 3x3 area.\n        *   The Middle-Left/Right pixels are missing -> **Horizontal Borders are Present (7).**\n        *   The Middle-Top/Bottom pixels are missing -> **Vertical Borders are Present (7).**\n        *   The Center pixel is missing -> **Intersections are Present (7).**\n        *   Result: A solid grid of 7s with 0s in the cell interiors.\n\n2.  **Applying a Highlight Overlay:** A specific region in the center of the output grid is highlighted with color 9.\n    *   **Region:** Rows 5-10 and Columns 5-10.\n    *   **Rule:** For pixels in this region, if the base pattern value is 0 (empty space), it is changed to 9. If the base pattern value is 7 (wall/border), it remains 7.\n\n**Constructing the Output for Test Input:**\n*   **Base Pattern:** A 16x16 grid where every 3rd row and every 3rd column is 7 (including intersections), and all other pixels are 0.\n*   **Overlay:** In the rectangle defined by `r` in [5, 10] and `c` in [5, 10], replace 0s with 9s. Since the grid lines are 7, they are preserved. The 2x2 interiors of the affected cells become 9s.\n\n**Step-by-step row generation:**\n*   **Grid Lines (Rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15):** All 7s.\n*   **Cell Rows (Rows 1, 2, 4, 11, 13, 14):** Pattern `7 0 0 7 0 0 ...`.\n*   **Overlay Cell Rows (Rows 5, 7, 8, 10):**\n    *   Columns 0-4: Base pattern `7 0 0 7 0`.\n    *   Columns 5-10 (Overlay): Base is `0 7 0 0 7 0`. 0s become 9s. Result: `9 7 9 9 7 9`.\n    *   Columns 11-15: Base pattern `0 7 0 0 7`.\n    *   Full row: `7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7`.\n*   **Overlay Grid Lines (Row 6, Row 9):**\n    *   Base is all 7s.

Here's my thought process:\n\n**First, I need to analyze the input grids.**  They're all 6x6, featuring a background color and a smaller 3x3 pattern in a distinct color.  The challenge seems to be about translating this pattern into a larger, patterned output. Let's look at the patterns in the inputs.\n\nI noticed three key elements: a background color (orange/7), a pattern color (varies by example), and a recurring, distinct 3x3 pattern. Example 1 is a cross shape of green pixels (3). Example 2 is a \"H\" or box shape with blue pixels (1). Example 3 is an \"X\" shape with magenta pixels (6).  The test input uses a pattern of red pixels (2).\n\n**Second, I'll examine the output grids.** They're 16x16, larger and more complex.  There's a repeating 2x2 grid structure, separated by 1-pixel borders. The content within these 2x2 blocks seems related to the input pattern, but not a direct copy. The most striking thing is that the grid structure itself appears constant across the examples. Additionally, there's a unique \"maroon box\" (color 9) at the center.\n\n**My hypothesis: The output is a zoomed-in representation of a 5x5 subgrid of the input, but the input values are mapped to new pixel values based on the shapes involved.**  \n* I noticed that the input size of 6x6 does not evenly divide into a tile-able pattern for the output of 16x16.\n* All output grids are 16x16 and have a 5x5 grid structure, which is separated by a 1-pixel border.\n\nThe critical observation is that the output *doesn't* contain the *color* of the input pattern (3, 1, 6). Instead, it uses 0, 7, and 9.  My insight is that 0 and 7 seem to be used to display a shape.\n\n**I have determined that the transformation is about the *structure/shape* of the pattern, rendered in the 0/7/9 color palette.** So let's look at the output examples again. I can infer the values in the 2x2 \"cell\" of the output by looking at the input, but the value is always mapped to 0 or 7. I found that the Maroon Box is a square ring and always located at the 5-10 index.\n\nI can make a basic model:\n*   Use Input(0,0), Input(0,1), Input(1,0) to determine 3 output values\n*   Cell, V, and H colors\n*   Cell Color = value based on Input(0,0). (Pattern = 0)\n*   V-Seg Color = value based on Input(0,1). (Background = 7, Pattern = 0)\n*   H-Seg Color = If Input(0,0) = 0 and Input(1,0) = 0 , 0, otherwise 7\n    *   H-Seg color = If both corners are pat and Row 0 sides are Pat then 0 else 7\n\nThen, construct the Output:\n- Horizontal Border = Output[0], Output[3] etc, always follows H-Seg rule\n- Vertical Border = Output[1], Output[4] etc, always follows V-Seg rule\n- Cell in the middle always uses the cell rule\n- All remaining pixels outside the Maroon Ring are generated using the above rules\n- Pixels inside the Maroon Ring always use value 9 (maroon) except for V and H Borders\n\nTherefore, I have a method to transform any 6x6 image to a 16x16 image!\n\n\nThe transformation maps a 3x3 pattern found in the input 6x6 grid to a 16x16 output grid. The output grid is composed of 5x5 cells (2x2 pixels each) separated by 1-pixel borders. The colors in the output are restricted to 0 (black), 7 (orange), and 9 (maroon), regardless of the pattern color in the input.\n\nThe 16x16 output is generated in two steps:\n1.  **Generate a Base Grid:** The base grid's texture depends on the specific pixels of the 3x3 input pattern. Let the 3x3 pattern be $P$, where pixels are either 'Pattern Color' (Pat) or 'Background Color' (Bg/7).\n    *   **Cell Color (2x2 blocks):** Determined by $P(0,0)$ (Top-Left pixel). If $P(0,0)$ is Pat, Cell Color is 0. If Bg, Cell Color is 7.\n    *   **Vertical Border Color (columns 0, 3, 6...):** Determined by $P(0,1)$ (Top-Middle pixel). If $P(0,1)$ is Pat, Border is 0. If Bg, Border is 7.\n    *   **Horizontal Border Segments (rows 0, 3, 6...):** Determined by $P(0,0)$ and $P(1,0)$. If ($P(0,0)$ is Pat AND $P(1,0)$ is Pat), Segment is 0. Else, Segment is 7. Note: Intersections of borders (pixels at border row/col crossings) are always 0.\n\n2.  **Apply Maroon Overlay:** A 6x6 square region of color 9 (maroon) is overlaid on the center of the grid (indices 5-10 for both row and column).

First, I'm noticing the input grids are all 6x6, and the output grids are 16x16. I can see the input always has an orange background and a shape of another color, and it seems this shape dictates what the output looks like.\n\n**I analyze the given examples.**\n\n*   **Inputs:** They\u2019re all 6x6 with a 7 (orange) background. One example has a green shape (3), one has blue (1), and one has magenta (6). The test input has red (2).\n*   **Outputs:** They\u2019re 16x16 with 0 (black), 7, and 9 (maroon) in them. My goal is to get 9 in the right places.\n\n**The output grid is a structured tiling pattern, it seems.** Let me break down the details:\n\n*   The outputs are 16x16, which is not a direct multiple of the 6x6 inputs. However, I can consider 16x16 as a 5x5 grid of cells, separated by one-pixel borders.\n*   The Output Grid is built on cells. Each cell is 2x2. The grid is 5 cells wide by 5 cells tall.\n*   Horizontal separator lines appear at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 (6 lines total).\n*   Vertical separator lines appear at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 (6 lines total).\n\n**The relationship between the input shapes and the output grid is key, it seems.** Each cell is a *representation* of an area in the input.\n\n*   I am thinking, the *position* of a shape in the input *seems* to somehow correspond to something in the output, maybe the \"highlighted\" area.\n*   I've noticed that the *center* of the output contains the 'maroon' color 9, and this relates to where the shape is inside the input, to some extent.\n*   The color in the input grid's shape, tells me the *type* of background pattern for the output grid.\n*   Then, there's the highlighted area. When I see where the maroon color 9 appears, it forms a square (lines and borders) within the 16x16 output. Inside of it, I see either orange or maroon, while orange is present everywhere. The 9s only appear in the \"highlighted area\".\n*   The \"highlighted\" area, is consistent between different examples, it seems to always center on the 3rd cell from the top, and from the left.\n\n**How to determine the patterns?**\n\n*   Input Shape Color to Output Pattern:\n    *   The \"background pattern\" of the output depends on what color is the shape in the input.\n\n*   I see a relationship, which seems very important. The relationship is as follows:\n    *   If the input's shape color is 3: the background consists of solid 'cells'.\n    *   If the input's shape color is 1: the background consists of vertical lines.\n    *   If the input's shape color is 6: the background consists of a grid.\n    *   If the input's shape color is 2 (new, for the Test Input), the background should consist of horizontal lines.\n\n*   If the color is 2: I'll output with rows of horizontal lines in the highlighted area.\n\n*   And the position of the highlight in the output seems fixed to the cell (2,2). This is consistent with what I observed.\n\n**Now I have a step-by-step strategy:**\n\n1.  Construct a 16x16 grid.\n2.  Use the input shape color (2 for the test case) to define the base pattern. I think the pattern will have Horizontal Lines (7 for segments, 0 for intersections).\n3.  Add the highlights. I can do it by changing the cells in the center to 9. The intersection and segments will be left as is.\n\nI'm feeling confident about this now, and I believe I have the right structure. Let me apply this process to the test case, and I should have the correct output.\n\n\nThe transformation involves creating a 16x16 output grid based on a specific \"background pattern\" determined by the color of the shape in the 6x6 input grid, and then applying a \"highlight\" to the center of that grid.\n\n**1. Output Grid Structure**\nThe 16x16 output represents a 5x5 grid of cells. Each cell is 2x2 pixels. The cells are separated by 1-pixel wide horizontal and vertical lines (borders).\n- **Horizontal Border Rows:** 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15\n- **Vertical Border Columns:** 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15\n- **Cell Rows:** (1,2), (4,5), (7,8), (10,11), (13,14)\n- **Cell Columns:** (1,2), (4,5), (7,8), (10,11), (13,14)\n\n**2. Determining the Background Pattern**\nThe pattern of Orange (7) and Black (0) in the output depends on the color of the shape in the input.\n- **Example 2 (Color 1 - Blue):** Vertical Borders are 7. Horizontal Borders and Cells are 0.\n- **Example 1 (Color 3 - Green):** Cells are 7. Borders (Vertical and Horizontal) are 0.\n- **Example 3 (Color 6 - Magenta):** Vertical and Horizontal Borders are 7. Cells are 0. (A grid/lattice).\n\nBy observing the relationship between the numbers and patterns (1=Vertical, 6=Vertical+Horizontal), we can infer that **Color 2 (Red)** corresponds to **Horizontal Borders**.\n- **Pattern for Color 2:** Horizontal Borders are 7. Vertical Borders and Cells are 0.\n    - Horizontal Border Rows (0, 3, 6...) will have 7s in the cell segments (cols 1-2, 4-5...) and 0s at the intersections (cols 0, 3, 6...).\n    - Cell Rows (1, 2, 4, 5...) will be all 0s.\n\n**3. Applying the Highlight**\nIn all examples, a specific region centered on the middle cell (2,2) is highlighted. This region spans **Rows 5-10** and **Columns 5-10**.\n- **Transformation Rule:** Within this region, any Black (0) pixel becomes Maroon (9). Any Orange (7) pixel remains Orange (7).\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Construction for Test Input**\n- **Input Color:** Red (2).\n- **Base Pattern:** Horizontal lines.\n    - Rows 0, 3, 12, 15: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`\n    - Rows 1, 2, 4, 11, 13, 14: All `0`s.\n- **Highlight Region (Rows 5-10, Cols 5-10):**\n    - **Row 5 (Cell Row):** Base is all `0`. Cols 5-10 become `9`.\n      Result: `0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0`\n    - **Row 6 (Horizontal Border Row):** Base is `0,7,7...`.\n      Cols 5-10: Col 5(7)->7, Col 6(0)->9, Col 7(7)->7, Col 8(7)->7, Col 9(0)->9, Col 10(7)->7.\n      Result: `0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0`\n    - **Row 7 (Cell Row):** Same as Row 5.\n    - **Row 8 (Cell Row):** Same as Row 5.\n    - **Row 9 (Horizontal Border Row):** Same as Row 6.\n    - **Row 10 (Cell Row):** Same as Row 5.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n**Alright, here's what I've figured out about this ARC problem. It looks like we're dealing with three examples of an image transformation, along with a new test case. The goal is to deduce the rules of this transformation. I'm going to break it down, step by step.**\n\nThe initial data shows a grid transformation from a smaller input (6x6) to a bigger output (16x16). I've got to analyze how the colors and shapes get repositioned and changed. The \"hints\" mention things about how the background should be a \u201clattice\u201d - and that the foreground pixels get replaced. Let's dig deeper:\n\n*   **Grid Structure:** The first thing I noticed is that the output grid isn't just a simple zoom. It looks like each input pixel is being stretched out or tiled. I deduced a conceptual 5x5 grid structure within the 16x16 output: where a 3x3 block is created for each 2x2 section of the original grid, with a one-pixel border between these blocks. I suspect there's also some shifting and mirroring depending on the pattern.\n*   **Foreground and Background:** The color change is a central piece. The shapes and colors of the input images get switched up in the output. Based on this, there are probably three different patterns for what makes the background, and based on the shapes, there should be a rule for changing the background pattern.\n*   **The \"Lattice\" Pattern:** I had to really understand the \"orange lattice on black\" hint. This means orange blocks separated by black lines, but I realized that it can be applied to many different patterns. In one example the orange lines are vertical, but it makes no difference to the output.\n*   **The Mysterious \"9\":** There is a unique color appearing in the output - a maroon-like color called \"9\". It seems to form a frame or border around a central area, and based on the input shapes, it looks like it gets \"drawn\" around, but not actually created by the initial data. This rule is applied on the conceptual grid that I defined previously.\n*   **Shape Analysis:** I've noticed a recurring pattern in the shapes of the example inputs - they are all roughly 3x3 pixel areas. Also, they all have a \"center pixel\" and also some edge pixels and corners. I think the shape affects what background design is made.\n*   **Background Patterns:** Looking at the three example inputs, there seem to be three patterns - Orange Squares, Vertical Orange Lines and, well, Orange outlines around black shapes. There is a method to figuring this out: based on the image's overall shape.\n\n**The Background Pattern Derivation**:\n\nBased on my analysis of the backgrounds, here is what I found.\n\n*   The Background Pattern depends on the number of \"walls\" on each input shape.\n*   The Background is based on 3 shapes, based on which pattern to apply.\n\nThe background pattern is made in the output, and is modified by an overlay.\n\n**The \"9\" Overlay Rule**:\n\nNow, about this maroon \"9\" and how it gets placed:\n\n*   The '9's are a result of applying an overlay.\n*   This overlay is applied to the 5x5 section of the 16x16 grid, which is 6 rows, 6 columns.\n\n**Putting It Together**\n\nHere's my general understanding:\n\n1.  Construct a 16x16 grid.\n2.  Based on the input image's shape and color, choose the proper background pattern.\n3.  Then, in the 5x5 conceptual section (indices 5-10 for rows and columns), convert any black pixels to the color \"9\".\n\n**Now, For The Test Input:**\n\n1.  The test input's shape is just four corners of a 3x3 pixel area. Color 2.\n2.  Based on this input shape, the appropriate background is derived - which will be horizontal lines.\n3.  Next, based on the process above - apply the rule in the 5x5 area and change black areas to color 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBased on the information above, I predict the output image.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid.\nBased on the solved examples and hints, we can deduce the following logic:\n\n1.  **Output Structure:** The 16x16 output grid conceptually represents a 5x5 grid of 2x2 cells separated by 1-pixel borders.\n    -   Pixel coordinates $(y, x)$ in the output map to grid coordinates:\n        -   $y = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15$ are **Horizontal Border Rows**.\n        -   $y = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8...$ are **Cell Rows**.\n        -   Similarly for columns.\n\n2.  **Background Pattern Generation:** The background pattern depends on the color of the foreground shape in the input.\n    -   **Input Color 3 (Green) [Ex 1]:** Filled Orange Cells.\n        -   Cells (y%3!=0, x%3!=0) are Orange (7).\n        -   Borders are Black (0).\n    -   **Input Color 1 (Blue) [Ex 2]:** Vertical Orange Lines.\n        -   Vertical Borders (x%3==0, except intersections) are Orange (7).\n        -   Horizontal Borders and Cells are Black (0).\n    -   **Input Color 6 (Magenta) [Ex 3]:** Grid Lines (Vertical + Horizontal).\n        -   All Borders (x%3==0 or y%3==0, except intersections) are Orange (7).\n        -   Cells are Black (0).\n    -   **Test Input Color 2 (Red):** Based on Color Arithmetic (Red + Blue = Magenta $\\rightarrow$ Horizontal + Vertical = Grid), Color 2 corresponds to **Horizontal Orange Lines**.\n        -   Horizontal Borders (y%3==0, except intersections) are Orange (7).\n        -   Vertical Borders and Cells are Black (0).\n\n    **Background Pattern for Test Input (Horizontal Lines):**\n    -   **Rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 (Border Rows):** `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`. (0 at intersections, 7 on line segments).\n    -   **All other rows (Cell Rows):** `0, 0, 0...` (All Black).\n\n3.  **Foreground Overlay:** A \"Maroon (9)\" overlay is applied to the background in a specific central region, representing the transformed shape.\n    -   The input shape is ignored except for its color (used above) and potentially its existence which triggers the overlay.\n    -   The overlay region is always the 6x6 area covering the \"borders\" around the central cell (2,2) of the 5x5 grid.\n    -   **Region:** Rows 5 through 10, Columns 5 through 10.\n    -   **Rule:** Inside this region, change any **Black (0)** pixel to **Maroon (9)**. Leave **Orange (7)** pixels unchanged.\n\n4.  **Applying Logic to Test Input:**\n    -   **Color:** 2 (Red) $\\rightarrow$ Background is Horizontal Orange Lines.\n    -   **Background Construction:**\n        -   Rows 0, 3, 12, 15 are `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`.\n        -   Rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14 are all `0`.\n        -   Rows 6, 9 are Border Rows (like Row 0).\n    -   **Overlay Application (Rows 5-10, Cols 5-10):**\n        -   **Rows 5, 7, 8, 10:** Background is all `0`. In cols 5-10, `0` becomes `9`.\n            -   Result: `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`.\n        -   **Rows 6, 9:** Background is `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0...`.\n            -   Columns 5-10 values: `7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7` (Indices: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).\n            -   Apply 0->9: `7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7`.\n            -   Result: `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`.\n\nThis yields the final grid.\n\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n</CANDIDATE 6>\n<CANDIDATE 7>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 16x16\n0770770770770770\n7007007007007007\n7007007007007007\n0770770770770770\n7007007007007007\n7007097997907007\n0770770770770770\n7007097997907007\n7007097997907007\n0770770770770770\n7007097997907007\n7007007007007007\n0770770770770770\n7007007007007007\n7007007007007007\n0770770770770770\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_3\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Find the 3x3 colored pattern** in the input (non-7 values)\n2. **Create a tiling pattern** based on the input pattern structure:\n   - Position (0,0) is always 0 (grid intersection)\n   - Positions (0,1), (0,2) are 7 if middle row edges of pattern are 7, else 0\n   - Positions (1,0), (2,0) are 7 if middle column edges of pattern are 7, else 0\n   - Positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) are 7 if pattern corners are 7, else 0\n3. **Tile this 3x3 pattern** to create the 16\u00d716 background\n4. **Tile the original pattern 2\u00d72** (creating 6\u00d76) and place it centered (rows 5-10, cols 5-10), replacing colored values with 9\n\n**For the test input:**\nThe 3\u00d73 pattern is at rows 0-2, cols 2-4:\n```\n2 7 2\n7 7 7\n2 7 2\n```\n\n- Corners are colored (2) \u2192 cell content = 0\n- Middle row edges are 7 \u2192 row grid lines have 7s between intersections\n- Middle column edges are 7 \u2192 column grid lines have 7s between intersections\n\nTiling pattern:\n```\n0 7 7\n7 0 0\n7 0 0\n```\n\nThe pattern tiled 2\u00d72 with 2\u21929:\n```\n9 7 9 9 7 9\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n9 7 9 9 7 9\n9 7 9 9 7 9\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n9 7 9 9 7 9\n```\n\n```\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_3_step_3\">\n### 1) Find the 3\u00d73 \u201csymbol\u201d in the 6\u00d76 input\nIn every example the background is **7** and all non\u20117 cells form one compact pattern.  \nWe take the **bounding box** of all non\u20117 cells;

Algorithm: (1) find 3\u00d73 bbox of non-7 cells; (2) map bbox: non-7\u21920, 7\u21927; (3) cyclic shift tile up-left by 1 (wrap); (4) tile 3\u00d73 across 16\u00d716; (5) in fixed center rows/cols 5..10, recolor 0\u21929 (leave 7).\nPHASE 2 (Back-test): Ex1 bbox\u2192mapped\u2192shift gives tile [[0,0,0],[0,7,7],[0,7,7]]; central 0\u21929 matches official. Pass. Ex2 shift gives [[0,0,0],[7,0,0],[7,0,0]]; overlay matches. Pass. Ex3 shift gives [[0,7,7],[7,0,0],[7,0,0]]; overlay matches. Pass. => Passed 3/3.\nPHASE 3 (Test consistency): Test bbox [[2,7,2],[7,7,7],[2,7,2]]\u2192mapped [[0,7,0],[7,7,7],[0,7,0]]\u2192shift [[7,7,7],[7,0,0],[7,0,0]]; tiling + center 0\u21929 exactly matches Candidate 1 grid. Consistent.\n\nCandidate 2\nPHASE 1: Selected REASONING_MODEL_C (clear discrete template chooser). Algorithm: choose among 3 hard-coded 3\u00d73 tiles A/B/C based on bbox edge-centers (top-middle else left-middle else default), tile to 16\u00d716, then in center 6\u00d76 recolor 0\u21929.\nPHASE 2: Ex1 top-middle filled \u21d2 Tile A; matches. Pass. Ex2 top-middle empty, left-middle filled \u21d2 Tile B; matches. Pass. Ex3 neither \u21d2 Tile C; matches. Pass. => Passed 3/3.\nPHASE 3: Test has empty top-middle and left-middle \u21d2 Tile C; central 0\u21929 yields Candidate 2 grid. Consistent.\n\nCandidate 6\nPHASE 1: Selected REASONING_MODEL_B (most explicit). Algorithm: pick base lattice \u201cmode\u201d solely from the foreground color value (3\u2192Tile A, 1\u2192Tile B, 6\u2192Tile C, 2\u2192horizontal-lines Tile D=[[0,7,7],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]); tile it to 16\u00d716; center 6\u00d76 recolor 0\u21929.\nPHASE 2: Ex1 color=3 \u21d2 Tile A matches. Pass. Ex2 color=1 \u21d2 Tile B matches. Pass. Ex3 color=6 \u21d2 Tile C matches. Pass. => Passed 3/3.\nPHASE 3: Test color=2 \u21d2 Tile D + center 0\u21929 exactly matches Candidate 6 grid. Consistent. (But the 2\u2192horizontal-lines mapping is an extra, unverified extrapolation.)\n\nCandidate 7\nPHASE 1: Selected REASONING_MODEL_A (most coherent + matches proposed grid). Algorithm: derive 3\u00d73 tile from whether certain bbox positions are background-7 (top row depends on middle-row edges being 7; left col depends on middle-col edges being 7; bottom-right 2\u00d72 depends on bbox corners being 7; tile[0,0]=0), tile to 16\u00d716; build a 6\u00d76 overlay by tiling the original 3\u00d73 pattern 2\u00d72 and writing 9 where original is non-7; place overlay at rows/cols 5..10.\nPHASE 2: Ex1 produces Tile A and the 2\u00d72-tiled plus-mask paints 9s exactly where official has them. Pass. Ex2 produces Tile B and tiled H-mask paints 9s as official. Pass. Ex3 produces Tile C and tiled X-mask paints 9s as official. Pass. => Passed 3/3.\nPHASE 3: Test produces Tile C; tiled corners-only mask paints 9 sparsely, leaving some 0s in the center block; Candidate 7 grid matches that.

My initial thought is to analyze the examples to understand how the output is derived.\n\nAfter carefully examining Example 1, I see that the output is composed of 2x2 blocks separated by single-pixel borders. The input's 6x6 size somehow translates into 5x5 such cells in the output, hinting that the input data might represent the corners of these cells. I'm focusing on the position of a specific shape (in this case, a 'plus' shape made of green 3s) in the input to see if there's a direct mapping to some feature within the grid cells. There's also this interesting 9-based overlay I spot. It seems to highlight a central 5x5 region in the output, specifically affecting the boundaries and some inner cells.\n\nThen, I check Example 2, and the overlay is in the exact same place! This reinforces the idea that the 9-pattern is constant. Now, I'm thinking about the base pattern and its relation to the input shape and the overlay. Also, the colors 0 and 7 have a role and I need to figure out how. In Example 2, the shape is a square of 1s, and I notice that only vertical borders exist in the base pattern. In Example 3, the shape is an X of 6s, and the gridlines are present in the base pattern. Now, let's formulate this with some logic!\n\nOkay, let's try something.  Let's consider the connectivity of the special color (3, 1, and 6 in the examples). Perhaps this connectivity hints at the output texture. It seems that the shape's presence defines which kind of lines appear in the output. For example, in Example 2, the output is vertical lines, and the H shape hints to verticality. In example 3 the shape is X so a box.\n\nLet's test this! So in Example 1, 3s are a plus (+); no lines.\n\nNow, I'm going to look at some logic!\n\nI hypothesize: The presence or absence of the color in certain areas (specifically at the middle of the sides) of a 3x3 region will determine if H and V lines appear in the output. If the middle pixels on the horizontal or vertical sides are missing, lines will be drawn.\n\n*   **H-Lines**: Check for color at (2,1) and (2,3). If **present**, remove Horizontal borders. Else, keep Horizontal borders.\n*   **V-Lines**: Check for color at (1,2) and (3,2). If **present**, remove Vertical borders. Else, keep Vertical borders.\n*   The interior color is determined, too. If we have some lines, then it is 0. If we have no lines, then 7.\n\nOkay, let's now look at the test input and apply the rules:\n\n*   **Test Input**:  We've got 2s. The shape is four dots.\n\nLet's look at the shape. It's the 4 dots. It is similar to Example 3 with the 6s except it's 4 dots with no central pixel. I'm thinking, that the 4-dot shape means a solid grid will appear in the output.\n\nApplying my rule, I find that horizontal lines are needed and vertical lines are needed, because the L/R Mid and T/B Mids are missing. This means a full grid should be the pattern! Let's now apply my theory with \"center pixel determines intersection color\"\n\n*   The key is if the center is present. If the center is colored, then broken intersection. If missing, solid intersection!\n*   In the test input, it is background color. So solid intersection.\n\nNow, all I need to do is generate the solid grid and overlay the fixed 9 regions and I should be all set!\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid.\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation involves two main steps:\n1.  **Generating a Base Pattern (16x16):** The input grid contains a specific shape formed by colored pixels (non-7 values) on a background of 7s. This shape determines the \"texture\" of the output grid. The output grid represents a 5x5 array of cells (each 2x2 pixels) separated by 1-pixel wide borders.\n    *   **Logic for Borders:**\n        *   The input shape is analyzed within a 3x3 bounding box.\n        *   **Vertical Borders (Columns 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15):** These are present (color 7) unless the top-middle and bottom-middle pixels of the 3x3 shape are present. If those pixels are present (as in Example 1), the vertical borders are suppressed (color 0).\n        *   **Horizontal Borders (Rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15):** These are present (color 7) unless the left-middle and right-middle pixels of the 3x3 shape are present. If those pixels are present (as in Example 1 and Example 2), the horizontal borders are suppressed (color 0).\n        *   **Intersections:** In Examples 1, 2, and 3, the intersections of border lines (indices divisible by 3) are 0. However, in the Test Input, the \"center\" pixel of the 3x3 shape is missing (it's background 7). In the previous examples, the center pixel was always part of the shape. The missing center implies a \"solid\" connection, meaning the intersections should be filled with 7, creating a continuous grid.\n        *   **Cell Interiors:** If any borders are present, the cell interiors (the 2x2 areas) are 0. If no borders are present (Example 1), the interiors are filled with 7.\n    *   **Application to Test Input:**\n        *   The shape (color 2) is four dots at the corners of a 3x3 area.\n        *   The Middle-Left/Right pixels are missing -> **Horizontal Borders are Present (7).**\n        *   The Middle-Top/Bottom pixels are missing -> **Vertical Borders are Present (7).**\n        *   The Center pixel is missing -> **Intersections are Present (7).**\n        *   Result: A solid grid of 7s with 0s in the cell interiors.\n\n2.  **Applying a Highlight Overlay:** A specific region in the center of the output grid is highlighted with color 9.\n    *   **Region:** Rows 5-10 and Columns 5-10.\n    *   **Rule:** For pixels in this region, if the base pattern value is 0 (empty space), it is changed to 9. If the base pattern value is 7 (wall/border), it remains 7.\n\n**Constructing the Output for Test Input:**\n*   **Base Pattern:** A 16x16 grid where every 3rd row and every 3rd column is 7 (including intersections), and all other pixels are 0.\n*   **Overlay:** In the rectangle defined by `r` in [5, 10] and `c` in [5, 10], replace 0s with 9s. Since the grid lines are 7, they are preserved. The 2x2 interiors of the affected cells become 9s.\n\n**Step-by-step row generation:**\n*   **Grid Lines (Rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15):** All 7s.\n*   **Cell Rows (Rows 1, 2, 4, 11, 13, 14):** Pattern `7 0 0 7 0 0 ...`.\n*   **Overlay Cell Rows (Rows 5, 7, 8, 10):**\n    *   Columns 0-4: Base pattern `7 0 0 7 0`.\n    *   Columns 5-10 (Overlay): Base is `0 7 0 0 7 0`. 0s become 9s. Result: `9 7 9 9 7 9`.\n    *   Columns 11-15: Base pattern `0 7 0 0 7`.\n    *   Full row: `7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7`.\n*   **Overlay Grid Lines (Row 6, Row 9):**\n    *   Base is all 7s. Overlay does not change 7s.\n    *   Full row: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`.\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_4_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation\n\n1. **Find the \u201cobject\u201d color**: the input is mostly `7` with a small set of cells of another color.

  <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1. **Output structure**: All outputs are 16\u00d716 grids with a repeating 3\u00d73 lattice pattern of 0s and 7s.\n\n2. **Central modification**: In all examples, there's a central 6\u00d76 region (rows 5-10, cols 5-10) where all 0s are replaced with 9s, while 7s remain unchanged.\n\n3. **Template selection**: The 3\u00d73 template varies based on the input shape:\n   - Example 1 (Cross/+ shape, color 3): Template `0,0,0 / 0,7,7 / 0,7,7`\n   - Example 2 (H shape, color 1): Template `0,0,0 / 7,0,0 / 7,0,0`  \n   - Example 3 (X/diamond shape, color 6): Template `0,7,7 / 7,0,0 / 7,0,0`\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\nThe test input shows color 2 at positions forming four corners:\n```\n..X.X.\n......\n..X.X.\n```\nThis creates a square/corners pattern - similar to the X shape but without the center cell.\n\n**Template Selection for Test:**\nSince the corners-only pattern is most structurally similar to the X shape (both emphasize diagonal/corner positions rather than orthogonal connections), I'll use Template 3:\n```\n0 7 7\n7 0 0\n7 0 0\n```\n\n**Building the Output:**\n1. Tile the 16\u00d716 grid with Template 3\n2.

Here's my thought process:\n\n**First, I need to analyze the input grids.**  They're all 6x6, featuring a background color and a smaller 3x3 pattern in a distinct color.  The challenge seems to be about translating this pattern into a larger, patterned output. Let's look at the patterns in the inputs.\n\nI noticed three key elements: a background color (orange/7), a pattern color (varies by example), and a recurring, distinct 3x3 pattern. Example 1 is a cross shape of green pixels (3). Example 2 is a \"H\" or box shape with blue pixels (1). Example 3 is an \"X\" shape with magenta pixels (6).  The test input uses a pattern of red pixels (2).\n\n**Second, I'll examine the output grids.** They're 16x16, larger and more complex.  There's a repeating 2x2 grid structure, separated by 1-pixel borders. The content within these 2x2 blocks seems related to the input pattern, but not a direct copy. The most striking thing is that the grid structure itself appears constant across the examples. Additionally, there's a unique \"maroon box\" (color 9) at the center.\n\n**My hypothesis: The output is a zoomed-in representation of a 5x5 subgrid of the input, but the input values are mapped to new pixel values based on the shapes involved.**  \n* I noticed that the input size of 6x6 does not evenly divide into a tile-able pattern for the output of 16x16.\n* All output grids are 16x16 and have a 5x5 grid structure, which is separated by a 1-pixel border.\n\nThe critical observation is that the output *doesn't* contain the *color* of the input pattern (3, 1, 6). Instead, it uses 0, 7, and 9.  My insight is that 0 and 7 seem to be used to display a shape.\n\n**I have determined that the transformation is about the *structure/shape* of the pattern, rendered in the 0/7/9 color palette.** So let's look at the output examples again. I can infer the values in the 2x2 \"cell\" of the output by looking at the input, but the value is always mapped to 0 or 7. I found that the Maroon Box is a square ring and always located at the 5-10 index.\n\nI can make a basic model:\n*   Use Input(0,0), Input(0,1), Input(1,0) to determine 3 output values\n*   Cell, V, and H colors\n*   Cell Color = value based on Input(0,0). (Pattern = 0)\n*   V-Seg Color = value based on Input(0,1). (Background = 7, Pattern = 0)\n*   H-Seg Color = If Input(0,0) = 0 and Input(1,0) = 0 , 0, otherwise 7\n    *   H-Seg color = If both corners are pat and Row 0 sides are Pat then 0 else 7\n\nThen, construct the Output:\n- Horizontal Border = Output[0], Output[3] etc, always follows H-Seg rule\n- Vertical Border = Output[1], Output[4] etc, always follows V-Seg rule\n- Cell in the middle always uses the cell rule\n- All remaining pixels outside the Maroon Ring are generated using the above rules\n- Pixels inside the Maroon Ring always use value 9 (maroon) except for V and H Borders\n\nTherefore, I have a method to transform any 6x6 image to a 16x16 image!\n\n\nThe transformation maps a 3x3 pattern found in the input 6x6 grid to a 16x16 output grid. The output grid is composed of 5x5 cells (2x2 pixels each) separated by 1-pixel borders. The colors in the output are restricted to 0 (black), 7 (orange), and 9 (maroon), regardless of the pattern color in the input.\n\nThe 16x16 output is generated in two steps:\n1.  **Generate a Base Grid:** The base grid's texture depends on the specific pixels of the 3x3 input pattern. Let the 3x3 pattern be $P$, where pixels are either 'Pattern Color' (Pat) or 'Background Color' (Bg/7).\n    *   **Cell Color (2x2 blocks):** Determined by $P(0,0)$ (Top-Left pixel). If $P(0,0)$ is Pat, Cell Color is 0. If Bg, Cell Color is 7.\n    *   **Vertical Border Color (columns 0, 3, 6...):** Determined by $P(0,1)$ (Top-Middle pixel). If $P(0,1)$ is Pat, Border is 0. If Bg, Border is 7.\n    *   **Horizontal Border Segments (rows 0, 3, 6...):** Determined by $P(0,0)$ and $P(1,0)$. If ($P(0,0)$ is Pat AND $P(1,0)$ is Pat), Segment is 0. Else, Segment is 7. Note: Intersections of borders (pixels at border row/col crossings) are always 0.\n\n2.  **Apply Maroon Overlay:** A 6x6 square region of color 9 (maroon) is overlaid on the center of the grid (indices 5-10 for both row and column).

First, I'm noticing the input grids are all 6x6, and the output grids are 16x16. I can see the input always has an orange background and a shape of another color, and it seems this shape dictates what the output looks like.\n\n**I analyze the given examples.**\n\n*   **Inputs:** They\u2019re all 6x6 with a 7 (orange) background. One example has a green shape (3), one has blue (1), and one has magenta (6). The test input has red (2).\n*   **Outputs:** They\u2019re 16x16 with 0 (black), 7, and 9 (maroon) in them. My goal is to get 9 in the right places.\n\n**The output grid is a structured tiling pattern, it seems.** Let me break down the details:\n\n*   The outputs are 16x16, which is not a direct multiple of the 6x6 inputs. However, I can consider 16x16 as a 5x5 grid of cells, separated by one-pixel borders.\n*   The Output Grid is built on cells. Each cell is 2x2. The grid is 5 cells wide by 5 cells tall.\n*   Horizontal separator lines appear at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 (6 lines total).\n*   Vertical separator lines appear at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 (6 lines total).\n\n**The relationship between the input shapes and the output grid is key, it seems.** Each cell is a *representation* of an area in the input.\n\n*   I am thinking, the *position* of a shape in the input *seems* to somehow correspond to something in the output, maybe the \"highlighted\" area.\n*   I've noticed that the *center* of the output contains the 'maroon' color 9, and this relates to where the shape is inside the input, to some extent.\n*   The color in the input grid's shape, tells me the *type* of background pattern for the output grid.\n*   Then, there's the highlighted area. When I see where the maroon color 9 appears, it forms a square (lines and borders) within the 16x16 output. Inside of it, I see either orange or maroon, while orange is present everywhere. The 9s only appear in the \"highlighted area\".\n*   The \"highlighted\" area, is consistent between different examples, it seems to always center on the 3rd cell from the top, and from the left.\n\n**How to determine the patterns?**\n\n*   Input Shape Color to Output Pattern:\n    *   The \"background pattern\" of the output depends on what color is the shape in the input.\n\n*   I see a relationship, which seems very important. The relationship is as follows:\n    *   If the input's shape color is 3: the background consists of solid 'cells'.\n    *   If the input's shape color is 1: the background consists of vertical lines.\n    *   If the input's shape color is 6: the background consists of a grid.\n    *   If the input's shape color is 2 (new, for the Test Input), the background should consist of horizontal lines.\n\n*   If the color is 2: I'll output with rows of horizontal lines in the highlighted area.\n\n*   And the position of the highlight in the output seems fixed to the cell (2,2). This is consistent with what I observed.\n\n**Now I have a step-by-step strategy:**\n\n1.  Construct a 16x16 grid.\n2.  Use the input shape color (2 for the test case) to define the base pattern. I think the pattern will have Horizontal Lines (7 for segments, 0 for intersections).\n3.  Add the highlights. I can do it by changing the cells in the center to 9. The intersection and segments will be left as is.\n\nI'm feeling confident about this now, and I believe I have the right structure. Let me apply this process to the test case, and I should have the correct output.\n\n\nThe transformation involves creating a 16x16 output grid based on a specific \"background pattern\" determined by the color of the shape in the 6x6 input grid, and then applying a \"highlight\" to the center of that grid.\n\n**1. Output Grid Structure**\nThe 16x16 output represents a 5x5 grid of cells. Each cell is 2x2 pixels. The cells are separated by 1-pixel wide horizontal and vertical lines (borders).\n- **Horizontal Border Rows:** 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15\n- **Vertical Border Columns:** 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15\n- **Cell Rows:** (1,2), (4,5), (7,8), (10,11), (13,14)\n- **Cell Columns:** (1,2), (4,5), (7,8), (10,11), (13,14)\n\n**2. Determining the Background Pattern**\nThe pattern of Orange (7) and Black (0) in the output depends on the color of the shape in the input.\n- **Example 2 (Color 1 - Blue):** Vertical Borders are 7. Horizontal Borders and Cells are 0.\n- **Example 1 (Color 3 - Green):** Cells are 7. Borders (Vertical and Horizontal) are 0.\n- **Example 3 (Color 6 - Magenta):** Vertical and Horizontal Borders are 7. Cells are 0. (A grid/lattice).\n\nBy observing the relationship between the numbers and patterns (1=Vertical, 6=Vertical+Horizontal), we can infer that **Color 2 (Red)** corresponds to **Horizontal Borders**.\n- **Pattern for Color 2:** Horizontal Borders are 7. Vertical Borders and Cells are 0.\n    - Horizontal Border Rows (0, 3, 6...) will have 7s in the cell segments (cols 1-2, 4-5...) and 0s at the intersections (cols 0, 3, 6...).\n    - Cell Rows (1, 2, 4, 5...) will be all 0s.\n\n**3. Applying the Highlight**\nIn all examples, a specific region centered on the middle cell (2,2) is highlighted.

It looks like we're dealing with three examples of an image transformation, along with a new test case. The goal is to deduce the rules of this transformation. I'm going to break it down, step by step.**\n\nThe initial data shows a grid transformation from a smaller input (6x6) to a bigger output (16x16). I've got to analyze how the colors and shapes get repositioned and changed. The \"hints\" mention things about how the background should be a \u201clattice\u201d - and that the foreground pixels get replaced. Let's dig deeper:\n\n*   **Grid Structure:** The first thing I noticed is that the output grid isn't just a simple zoom. It looks like each input pixel is being stretched out or tiled. I deduced a conceptual 5x5 grid structure within the 16x16 output: where a 3x3 block is created for each 2x2 section of the original grid, with a one-pixel border between these blocks. I suspect there's also some shifting and mirroring depending on the pattern.\n*   **Foreground and Background:** The color change is a central piece. The shapes and colors of the input images get switched up in the output. Based on this, there are probably three different patterns for what makes the background, and based on the shapes, there should be a rule for changing the background pattern.\n*   **The \"Lattice\" Pattern:** I had to really understand the \"orange lattice on black\" hint. This means orange blocks separated by black lines, but I realized that it can be applied to many different patterns. In one example the orange lines are vertical, but it makes no difference to the output.\n*   **The Mysterious \"9\":** There is a unique color appearing in the output - a maroon-like color called \"9\". It seems to form a frame or border around a central area, and based on the input shapes, it looks like it gets \"drawn\" around, but not actually created by the initial data. This rule is applied on the conceptual grid that I defined previously.\n*   **Shape Analysis:** I've noticed a recurring pattern in the shapes of the example inputs - they are all roughly 3x3 pixel areas. Also, they all have a \"center pixel\" and also some edge pixels and corners. I think the shape affects what background design is made.\n*   **Background Patterns:** Looking at the three example inputs, there seem to be three patterns - Orange Squares, Vertical Orange Lines and, well, Orange outlines around black shapes. There is a method to figuring this out: based on the image's overall shape.\n\n**The Background Pattern Derivation**:\n\nBased on my analysis of the backgrounds, here is what I found.\n\n*   The Background Pattern depends on the number of \"walls\" on each input shape.\n*   The Background is based on 3 shapes, based on which pattern to apply.\n\nThe background pattern is made in the output, and is modified by an overlay.\n\n**The \"9\" Overlay Rule**:\n\nNow, about this maroon \"9\" and how it gets placed:\n\n*   The '9's are a result of applying an overlay.\n*   This overlay is applied to the 5x5 section of the 16x16 grid, which is 6 rows, 6 columns.\n\n**Putting It Together**\n\nHere's my general understanding:\n\n1.  Construct a 16x16 grid.\n2.  Based on the input image's shape and color, choose the proper background pattern.\n3.  Then, in the 5x5 conceptual section (indices 5-10 for rows and columns), convert any black pixels to the color \"9\".\n\n**Now, For The Test Input:**\n\n1.  The test input's shape is just four corners of a 3x3 pixel area. Color 2.\n2.  Based on this input shape, the appropriate background is derived - which will be horizontal lines.\n3.  Next, based on the process above - apply the rule in the 5x5 area and change black areas to color 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBased on the information above, I predict the output image.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid.\nBased on the solved examples and hints, we can deduce the following logic:\n\n1.  **Output Structure:** The 16x16 output grid conceptually represents a 5x5 grid of 2x2 cells separated by 1-pixel borders.\n    -   Pixel coordinates $(y, x)$ in the output map to grid coordinates:\n        -   $y = 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15$ are **Horizontal Border Rows**.\n        -   $y = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8...$ are **Cell Rows**.\n        -   Similarly for columns.\n\n2.  **Background Pattern Generation:** The background pattern depends on the color of the foreground shape in the input.\n    -   **Input Color 3 (Green) [Ex 1]:** Filled Orange Cells.\n        -   Cells (y%3!=0, x%3!=0) are Orange (7).\n        -   Borders are Black (0).\n    -   **Input Color 1 (Blue) [Ex 2]:** Vertical Orange Lines.\n        -   Vertical Borders (x%3==0, except intersections) are Orange (7).\n        -   Horizontal Borders and Cells are Black (0).\n    -   **Input Color 6 (Magenta) [Ex 3]:** Grid Lines (Vertical + Horizontal).\n        -   All Borders (x%3==0 or y%3==0, except intersections) are Orange (7).\n        -   Cells are Black (0).\n    -   **Test Input Color 2 (Red):** Based on Color Arithmetic (Red + Blue = Magenta $\\rightarrow$ Horizontal + Vertical = Grid), Color 2 corresponds to **Horizontal Orange Lines**.\n        -   Horizontal Borders (y%3==0, except intersections) are Orange (7).\n        -   Vertical Borders and Cells are Black (0).\n\n    **Background Pattern for Test Input (Horizontal Lines):**\n    -   **Rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 (Border Rows):** `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0`. (0 at intersections, 7 on line segments).\n    -   **All other rows (Cell Rows):** `0, 0, 0...` (All Black).\n\n3.  **Foreground Overlay:** A \"Maroon (9)\" overlay is applied to the background in a specific central region, representing the transformed shape.\n    -   The input shape is ignored except for its color (used above) and potentially its existence which triggers the overlay.\n    -   The overlay region is always the 6x6 area covering the \"borders\" around the central cell (2,2) of the 5x5 grid.\n    -   **Region:** Rows 5 through 10, Columns 5 through 10.\n    -   **Rule:** Inside this region, change any **Black (0)** pixel to **Maroon (9)**.

Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1.
