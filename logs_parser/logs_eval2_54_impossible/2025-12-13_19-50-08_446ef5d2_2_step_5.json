            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's what I'm thinking:** I'm tasked with cracking an ARC puzzle. The first thing I do is analyze the examples provided to get a handle on the rules. I'm looking for patterns, like what the colors mean, the structure of the objects, and any transformations involved.\n\nI start by breaking down the example input grids into their components. I'm identifying distinct blocks of color, and trying to understand their relationships and dimensions. I notice that there seems to be a special \"noise\" color (yellow, in this case), and any block it touches might get filtered out or be less relevant. I'm also carefully watching how the input is transformed into the output.\n\nI go back and forth between input and output, trying to find how the output is derived from the input's components. I realize the core operation is about jigsaw-puzzling the input fragments together. I'm carefully checking the dimensions, positions, and internal structure of the blocks, particularly how their edges match with each other. The focus is to assemble a single large rectangle.\n\nI start by defining the fragments. I have to find all rectangular blocks and, based on the color analysis, I filter the noise. This is where the yellow color comes into play. Anything that contains this color, or anything that's adjacent to this color is potentially discarded.\n\nI'm starting to think about strategies for solving. The first example shows me the basic idea of block assembly, where one big rectangle is assembled from smaller rectangles. The dimensions are important, and the order of the pieces is relevant. I observe that edges match by color to form a larger object with an overall consistent appearance.\n\nI start testing this approach on the provided input, carefully isolating all of the \"clean\" rectangles in the input, discarding any that may have been \"tainted\" by the noise color. I also check how the positions of the blocks affect the placement of the result. Based on the patterns, I can figure out the correct solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to reconstruct an object by identifying scattered rectangular fragments in the input grid, filtering out noise, and assembling the valid pieces like a jigsaw puzzle.\n\n**1. Analysis of Input and Noise:**\nThe input grid contains several rectangular regions of colored pixels on a background of teal (8).\n- We observe patches of maroon (9) and green (3).\n- There is also a cluster of yellow (4) pixels in the top-right. In the solved examples, yellow (4) acted as a \"noise\" indicator; any connected component containing or touching yellow pixels was discarded.\n- Applying this rule, the top-right cluster (containing 4s and touching 9s) is discarded.\n\n**2. Identification of Fragments:**\nWe extract the remaining valid connected components (strips) from the input:\n- **Strip 1 (Top Left):** Rows 3-9, Cols 0-2. Width 3.\n  - Pattern (L-to-R): `9,9,9`; `9,3,3`; `9,3,9`; `9,3,3`; `9,3,9`; `9,3,3`; `9,9,9`.\n- **Strip 2 (Top Middle):** Rows 1-7, Cols 6-9. Width 4.\n  - Pattern includes `9,9,9,9` at top and bottom.\n- **Strip 3 (Bottom Left):** Rows 13-19, Cols 3-5. Width 3.\n- **Strip 4 (Middle Right):** Rows 8-14, Cols 13-15. Width 3.\n  - Note: There is a small fragment at R17-19 Cols 11-13, but it doesn't fit the main height profile or assembly logic, and is likely unused residue similar to noise.\n\n**3. Assembly (Jigsaw Puzzle):**\nAll valid strips have a height of 7. We arrange them horizontally by matching the color patterns of their adjacent vertical edges (seams).\n- **Seam 1 (Strip 1 Right vs Strip 2 Left):**\n  - Strip 1 Right Edge: `9,3,9,3,9,3,9`.\n  - Strip 2 Left Edge: `9,3,9,3,9,3,9`. (Match)\n- **Seam 2 (Strip 2 Right vs Strip 4 Left):**\n  - Strip 2 Right Edge: `9,9,9,3,3,9,9`.\n  - Strip 4 Left Edge: `9,9,9,3,3,9,9`. (Match)\n- **Seam 3 (Strip 4 Right vs Strip 3 Left):**\n  - Strip 4 Right Edge: `9,9,3,9,9,3,9`.\n  - Strip 3 Left Edge: `9,9,3,9,9,3,9`. (Match)\n\nOrder: **Strip 1 | Strip 2 | Strip 4 | Strip 3**.\nTotal Width: 3 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 13.\nHeight: 7.\n\n**4. Placement:**\nThe assembled object is 13x7. We center it in the 20x20 output grid.\n- Vertical Center: (20 - 7) // 2 = 6. Top row is Row 6.\n- Horizontal Center: (20 - 13) // 2 = 3. Left column is Column 3.\n\n**5. Final Grid Construction:**\n- Rows 0-5 and 13-19 are filled with background (8).\n- Columns 0-2 and 16-19 are filled with background (8).\n- The object occupies Rows 6-12, Columns 3-15.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Stitching Together Fragments**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It seems I'm being asked to solve an ARC problem where the goal is to reconstruct a final image from scattered fragments. The key here is understanding that the input isn't a direct representation of the output, but rather a set of clues.\n\nI start by analyzing the examples. The first example demonstrates the principle of reconstructing a larger object from smaller pieces. I notice that background colors are irrelevant, and that there are often a few colors of interest. In Example 1, I see several rectangular regions with distinct color patterns. I quickly realize I need to identify these as individual \"fragments\" or \"components\". My initial thought is to identify all the separate regions of non-background colors. I begin tracing these regions in the example, noting their shapes and relative positions to each other, comparing these positions with the output. In the process, I start to treat the output like a jigsaw puzzle. But, with this approach, I start seeing that maybe I can segment the image by connectivity.\n\nAfter looking carefully at the output, I begin to theorize that the final image is formed by assembling the input \"fragments\" together. The colors and their arrangements in the output are indicative of this construction. I also notice that the input may contain \"noise\" pixels, such as a color that doesn't appear in the output. This leads me to believe I need a way to discard or treat \"noise\" pixels. I consider the possibility of overlapping regions and how to resolve them when pixels conflict.\n\nWith Example 2, I try to understand the pattern. I see that there are more fragmented components, and I realize the concept of a \"noise color\" is correct.  I decide that I need to come up with an algorithm to:\n\n1.  Identify the connected components, treat \"noise\" colors as background.\n2.  Determine a proper placement or positioning of these components to form a coherent image.\n\nIn Test Input, I begin by extracting all the non-noise pixels. I find myself looking for repeating patterns and recognizable structures within these fragments. I quickly try to find a repeating structure and see if I can extend it with neighboring fragments. This is a \"stitching\" strategy. As I try this out, it becomes evident that the fragments might not be directly in the same orientation as the final image and may need to be transformed.\n\nI then propose that the image follows some pattern. After a lot of analysis of the structure, it looks like a 7x6 grid and the fragments are not in their final positions but rather cover certain regions. I verify my hypothesis by building a grid based on my assumed structure (7x6) by using the fragments and stitching them together.\n\nI start building the grid to form the final result. In this phase, I need to keep checking whether there are conflicts between components. The strategy involves identifying the corresponding fragments and then making sure the seam where the fragments meet is consistent. After several rounds of checking the seam with the fragments, I see the pattern holding. In this process, I also had to re-check the location of fragments since sometimes I mistook their location in the input.\n\nIn the end, by analyzing the arrangement of colors, particularly the repeated patterns within the fragments and the output image, the final result is a 7x6 grid with a consistent structure and the right colors.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a complete image from a grid containing scattered, fragmented, and noisy parts of that image. The background color is 8 (teal). The \"noise\" color 4 (yellow) appears in the input but not in the output of the examples, suggesting it should be ignored or treated as background.\n\n**Methodology:**\n1.  **Identify Fragments:** We locate connected components or patches of non-8 (and non-4) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Align Fragments:** We assume these patches are partial views of a single underlying target grid. We look for overlaps\u2014regions where the patterns in different patches match exactly. Specifically, we look for a \"seam\" where the right edge of a left-side fragment matches the left edge of a right-side fragment.\n3.  **Synthesize Grid:** We merge the aligned fragments to form the complete output grid.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n-   **Left Fragment (Strip):** In the test input, columns 0-2 contain a continuous vertical strip from Row 3 to Row 9.\n    -   Pattern (Rows 3-9 of input):\n        -   R3: `9,9,9`\n        -   R4: `9,3,3`\n        -   R5: `9,3,9`\n        -   R6: `9,3,3`\n        -   R7: `9,3,9`\n        -   R8: `9,3,3`\n        -   R9: `9,9,9`\n    -   This strip is 7 rows high and 3 columns wide.\n\n-   **Right Fragment (Patch):** Columns 6-9 (specifically 6-9) contain a large patch from Row 1 to Row 7.\n    -   Pattern (Rows 1-7 of input):\n        -   R1: `9,9,9,9`\n        -   R2: `3,3,9,9`\n        -   R3: `9,3,9,9`\n        -   R4: `3,3,3,3`\n        -   R5: `9,3,3,3`\n        -   R6: `3,3,9,9`\n        -   R7: `9,9,9,9`\n    -   This patch is 7 rows high.\n\n-   **Alignment (The Seam):**\n    We compare the rightmost column of the Left Fragment (Col 2) with the leftmost column of the Right Fragment (Col 6).\n    -   Left Col 2 (Rows 3-9): `9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9`\n    -   Right Col 6 (Rows 1-7): `9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9`\n    -   The patterns match perfectly. This indicates that the Left Fragment corresponds to the left side of the final image (Cols 0-2), and the Right Fragment corresponds to the right side (Cols 3-5), overlapping at the seam (or adjacent, but the matching suggests the spatial relationship).\n    -   Since the seam matches row-for-row (Left Fragment Row $i$ matches Right Fragment Row $i-2$), we can construct the final grid of size 7x6.\n\n-   **Construction:**\n    We concatenate the Left Fragment (Cols 0-2) and the Right Fragment's remainder (Cols 7-9).\n    \n    -   **Row 0:** Left `9,9,9` + Right `9,9,9` -> `9,9,9,9,9,9`\n    -   **Row 1:** Left `9,3,3` + Right `3,9,9` -> `9,3,3,3,9,9`\n    -   **Row 2:** Left `9,3,9` + Right `3,9,9` -> `9,3,9,3,9,9`\n    -   **Row 3:** Left `9,3,3` + Right `3,3,3` -> `9,3,3,3,3,3`\n    -   **Row 4:** Left `9,3,9` + Right `3,3,3` -> `9,3,9,3,3,3`\n    -   **Row 5:** Left `9,3,3` + Right `3,9,9` -> `9,3,3,3,9,9`\n    -   **Row 6:** Left `9,9,9` + Right `9,9,9` -> `9,9,9,9,9,9`\n\nThe resulting grid is 7 rows by 6 columns.\n\n9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,3,3,3,9,9\n9,3,9,3,9,9\n9,3,3,3,3,3\n9,3,9,3,3,3\n9,3,3,3,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9",

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Final Thoughts on the ARC Task:**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. The user wants me to solve this ARC task, and it seems to involve assembling images from \"broken\" fragments. My initial observation is that each input consists of a background color and several \"objects,\" which are basically rectangular frames enclosing some internal pixels of a different color. The goal is to combine these fragments into a single coherent object.\n\nMy strategy started by analyzing Example 1, where I painstakingly dissected the input and output grids, looking for patterns and trying to understand how these fragments connect. I identified distinct rectangular-ish pieces within the input, recognizing that the output was essentially a rearrangement of these pieces. I also noticed some colors being discarded or ignored.\n\nThe breakthrough came when I realized it's a puzzle-like process where fragments overlap to create a larger rectangle/square image, and by extension, the target object! I needed to identify overlapping edges to create a complete target shape. I also discovered the importance of discarding some fragments (those that have non-relevant colors) and only keeping \"matching\" ones that have common colors. Example 2 confirmed this idea: only valid overlapping pieces were used to build a valid output shape. This is the crucial rule that had been implied throughout the first example, that some fragments are not needed and should not be used in the assembly. \n\nApplying this logic to the test input was a lot of detailed parsing of the grid text. I had to identify the individual fragments, their dimensions, and the overlapping regions. The key was to look for edges that match \u2013 for instance, a 9 on one fragment aligning with a 9 on another \u2013 which would serve as connectors in the final assembly. This is how the target shape emerges by placing these pieces. I started by looking at all the pieces and identified these edges. I'm able to identify matching edges to form the parts of the target object. It's almost like a jigsaw puzzle or a building block exercise, where each piece needs to fit perfectly with its neighbors.\n\nIn the test input, I was able to build the largest rectangular shape by starting with the \"Left\" large fragment, then attaching another \"Top Middle\" one to its right. I had to continue building the larger rectangular structure, by finding and arranging the pieces at the bottom and the top right edges. With some careful edge comparisons (and more detailed text parsing!), I discovered how each remaining piece would attach to complete the target shape. After that, I did a lot of checking on overlapping and non-relevant parts. Then, the object was built and placed to produce the output. And that's it!\n\n\nTo solve this task, I identified the goal as assembling a single coherent object from scattered rectangular fragments found in the input grid. The fragments overlap by their edges to form a larger picture, similar to a jigsaw puzzle. The final object is a rectangle with a continuous border. Fragments that do not fit the pattern (like those with unique colors not appearing in the main border/interior scheme, e.g., yellow) are treated as distractors and discarded.\n\n**Step-by-step Assembly:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Input Fragments:**\n    *   **Piece 1 (Top Left):** Rows 3-9, Cols 0-3. A 7x3 piece. Left edge is all `9`s. Right edge is `9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9`.\n    *   **Piece 2 (Top Middle):** Rows 1-7, Cols 6-9. A 7x4 piece. Left edge is `9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9`. Matches Piece 1's right edge perfectly.\n    *   **Piece 3 (Top Right):** Rows 2-5, Cols 15-18 (ignoring the yellow `4`s which are distractors). A 4x3 piece. Left edge `9, 9, 3, 3`. Right edge is all `9`s.\n    *   **Piece 4 (Bottom Right 1):** Rows 8-9, Cols 13-16. A 2x3 piece. Left edge `9, 9`. Right edge is `9, 9`.\n    *   **Piece 5 (Bottom Right 2):** Rows 10-14, Cols 13-16. A 5x3 piece. Left edge `9, 3, 3, 9, 9`.\n    *   **Piece 6 (Bottom Left 1):** Rows 13-19, Cols 3-6. A 7x3 piece. Left edge `9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 3, 9`.\n    *   **Piece 7 (Bottom Left 2):** Rows 17-19, Cols 11-13. A 3x3 piece. Left edge `3, 3, 9`. Right edge is all `9`s.\n\n2.  **Construct the Puzzle:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Merge Piece 1 and Piece 2 (Overlap 1 column).\n        *   Result size: 7 rows x 6 cols. Right edge: `9, 9, 9, 3, 3, 9, 9`.\n    *   **Step 2:** Stack Piece 4 on top of Piece 5.\n        *   P4 (2 rows) + P5 (5 rows) = 7 rows.\n        *   Left edge of stack: `9, 9` (from P4) + `9, 3, 3, 9, 9` (from P5) = `9, 9, 9, 3, 3, 9, 9`.\n        *   This matches the right edge of the Step 1 assembly perfectly.\n        *   Merge them (Overlap 1 column). Result size: 7 rows x 8 cols.\n        *   Right edge of P4/P5 stack: `9, 9` + `3, 9, 9, 3, 9` = `9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 3, 9`.\n    *   **Step 3:** Attach Piece 6.\n        *   Left edge of Piece 6 is `9, 9, 3, 9, 9, 3, 9`.\n        *   Matches the right edge of the current assembly.\n        *   Merge them (Overlap 1 column). Result size: 7 rows x 10 cols.\n        *   Right edge of Piece 6: `9, 9, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9`.\n    *   **Step 4:** Stack Piece 3 on top of Piece 7.\n        *   P3 (4 rows) + P7 (3 rows) = 7 rows.\n        *   Left edge of stack: `9, 9, 3, 3` (from P3) + `3, 3, 9` (from P7) = `9, 9, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9`.\n        *   Matches the right edge of Piece 6.\n        *   Merge them (Overlap 1 column). Result size: 7 rows x 12 cols.\n        *   Right edge of stack is all `9`s, completing the border.\n\n3.  **Final Object:** A 7x12 rectangle with a maroon (`9`) border and a green (`3`)/maroon (`9`) pattern inside.\n\n4.  **Placement:** Center the 7x12 object in the 20x20 grid.\n    *   Rows 6-12.\n    *   Cols 4-15.\n    *   Fill the rest with background (`8`).\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,3,3,3,9,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Final Answer and Process**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm being asked to solve an ARC puzzle based on these two examples. Let me break down my thoughts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the patterns. I start by meticulously examining the input and output grids, tracing colors, object shapes, and number placements. The yellow color in the input grids is a major clue, possibly aligning points or overlaps. I initially think it is corners, but the behavior is inconsistent. It reminds me of the jigsaw puzzle analogy. The output seems to be assembling parts from the input. I begin by analyzing each piece within the puzzle and their shapes and borders. This is a crucial step! The example input and output start to show structure and the final dimensions.\n\nI see that the output is composed of separate \"pieces\" - rectangular blocks, each defined by color 9 borders and patterns within. Border color, I'm noting. I must trace the object boundaries and how they connect to each other. The goal is to construct a final image based on these pieces. I'm seeing that pieces have specific properties. Each rectangular piece is made of blocks, some are bordered, some are internal. Borders and their connection properties are important. Missing borders indicate they're meant to connect to another piece. I start mapping input pieces (from the \"fragments\") to the output position, focusing on matching \"jagged\" edges - the way pieces fit together. This is where I start to form my assembly plan: I see a repeating pattern of 3-color columns and some internal shifting patterns. This will be the \"jigsaw piece\" pattern. I'm constantly verifying my pattern with the input and output examples. The yellow \"4\"s in some of the input become a vital part of the assembly rules; maybe they're placement guides, maybe they have special properties, I must look closely. My goal is to recreate this arrangement for the Test Input.\n\nAfter examining the test input, I try to construct the output grid by placing the \"pieces\". I need to identify which pieces make up a single strip. The shapes are similar, but with different sizes. The yellow clues start to make sense. So, in the end, it's just about assembling these rectangles by following specific rules of pattern matching and using the yellow hints. I will follow and combine the pattern matching and assembly to complete the given output grid.\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a single coherent object from scattered \"puzzle pieces\" in the input grid.\nBased on the solved examples:\n1.  **Identify the Pieces:** The input contains several rectangular or shaped regions distinct from the background (color 8). These act as fragments of a final image.\n2.  **Determine Boundaries and Interior:**\n    *   In Example 1, pieces have an orange (7) border and interiors of black (0) and red (2). The final object combines these into a rectangular block with an orange border.\n    *   In Example 2, pieces have corners marked with yellow (4), but the final object has a green (3) border and maroon (9) interior. The yellow seems to serve as a marker for corners or alignment but is replaced by the border color in the output.\n3.  **Assemble the Puzzle:**\n    *   The pieces have \"jagged\" internal edges (patterns of colors) that match adjacent pieces.\n    *   We can infer the relative positions of the pieces by matching these edge patterns or by identifying corner pieces (using borders or special markers like yellow pixels).\n4.  **Construct the Output:**\n    *   Create a single rectangular object.\n    *   The border color is determined by the dominant border color of the pieces (9 in the test case).\n    *   The interior is filled by the assembled content.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Pieces Found:**\n    1.  **Left Strip (Rows 3-9, Cols 0-2):** Has a `9` border on Top, Left, and Bottom. Interior columns show vertical patterns.\n    2.  **Top Right / Yellow Piece (Rows 1-3, Cols 17-18):** Contains yellow `4`s. Based on Example 2, this marks the Top Right corner. The `4`s become border `9`s.\n    3.  **Middle/Bottom Pieces:** Various fragments (e.g., Cols 6-9, Cols 13-15) providing interior patterns.\n\n*   **Pattern Analysis & Alignment:**\n    *   **Height:** The Left Strip is 7 rows high (including borders). This sets the object height to 7.\n    *   **Border:** The border color is `9` (Maroon).\n    *   **Interior Width:** Matching the patterns across pieces suggests an interior width of 5 columns.\n    *   **Column Patterns (Interior indices 0-4):**\n        *   **Col 1 (from Left Strip):** `3, 3, 3, 3, 3` (Green).\n        *   **Col 2 (from Left Strip):** `3, 9, 3, 3, 9` (Alternating).\n        *   **Col 3 (from Middle Piece):** `3, 3, 3, 3, 3` (Green).\n        *   **Col 4 (from Middle/Right pieces):** `9, 9, 3, 3, 9`.\n        *   **Col 5 (from Top Right & Bottom Right pieces):** `9, 3, 9, 9, 3`.\n\n*   **Final Assembly (7x7 Grid):**\n    *   **Row 1 (Top Border):** All `9`s.\n    *   **Rows 2-6 (Interior):**\n        *   R2: `9` (Border), `3` (C1), `3` (C2), `3` (C3), `9` (C4), `9` (C5), `9` (Border). -> `9,3,3,3,9,9,9`\n        *   R3: `9` (Border), `3` (C1), `9` (C2), `3` (C3), `9` (C4), `3` (C5), `9` (Border). -> `9,3,9,3,9,3,9`\n        *   R4: `9` (Border), `3` (C1), `3` (C2), `3` (C3), `3` (C4), `9` (C5), `9` (Border). -> `9,3,3,3,3,9,9`\n        *   R5: `9` (Border), `3` (C1), `3` (C2), `3` (C3), `3` (C4), `9` (C5), `9` (Border). -> `9,3,3,3,3,9,9`\n        *   R6: `9` (Border), `3` (C1), `9` (C2), `3` (C3), `9` (C4), `3` (C5), `9` (Border). -> `9,3,9,3,9,3,9`\n    *   **Row 7 (Bottom Border):** All `9`s.\n\nThe object is centered in the output grid.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to understand how input fragments combine to form the output pattern.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n- Example 1: Multiple scattered fragments (with 7s as border, 0s and 2s as fills) combine into one unified bordered rectangle\n- Example 2: Four small patterns (with 3s as border, 9s as fill) combine into a single larger pattern\n- The color \"4\" appears to serve as a position marker (indicating corners) and is removed in the output\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\nI identify several fragments:\n1. **Left fragment** (rows 3-9, cols 0-2): 7\u00d73 block with 9s on border, 3s inside\n2. **Center fragment** (rows 1-7, cols 6-9): 7\u00d74 block with 9s on edges, 3s interior\n3. **Fragment with 4s** (rows 1-5, cols 15-18): Top-right corner marker\n4. Other supporting fragments at various positions\n\n**Combining Fragments:**\nThe left and center fragments share the same height (7 rows) and need to be aligned. Checking column overlap:\n- Left fragment col 2 values: 9,3,9,3,9,3,9\n- Center fragment col 6 values (shifted to align rows): 9,3,9,3,9,3,9\nThese match, indicating they overlap at this column.\n\n**Combined Pattern (7\u00d76):**\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,3,3,3,9,9\n9,3,9,3,9,9\n9,3,3,3,3,3\n9,3,9,3,3,3\n9,3,3,3,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9\n```\n\nThis pattern has 9s as the border and 3s filling the interior with some internal 9 structure.\n\n**Centering in Output:**\nFor a 20\u00d720 grid with 7\u00d76 pattern:\n- Row offset: (20-7)/2 = 6\n- Col offset: (20-6)/2 = 7\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n- **8 is the background** (it fills almost the whole grid).\n- There are several **disconnected \u201cpieces\u201d** made of the other colors.\n- **Color 4 is a marker/noise**: it appears in inputs but never survives in outputs, so we treat it as background and ignore it.\n- The remaining colored pieces are **rectangular fragments** of one bigger rectangle.\n- The bigger rectangle is reconstructed by **stitching pieces together**:\n  - Pieces are ordered so that the **rightmost column of one piece is identical to the leftmost column of the next piece**.\n  - When joining, that matching column is **overlapped (merged)** so it is not duplicated.\n- Finally, the reconstructed rectangle is placed so its **bottom-right corner is 2 cells away** from the grid\u2019s bottom-right corner (i.e. it ends at row `H-2`, col `W-2`), matching both solved examples.\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n1. Background = **8**. Treat **4 as background** and ignore it.\n2. Extract the rectangular connected components of colors **9 and 3**.\n3. One \u201ccolumn piece\u201d is split into a **4\u00d73** part (upper-right) and a **3\u00d73** part (lower area); stack them to make a full **7\u00d73** piece.\n4. Stitch all 7-high pieces left\u2192right by matching/overlapping identical border columns, producing a **7\u00d712** final rectangle:\n   ```\n   999999999999\n   933399993939\n   939399333339\n   933333393339\n   939333393339\n   933399333339\n   999999999999\n   ```\n5.

            "Full raw LLM response": "### What the transformation does\n\n1. **Background color**  \n   The most frequent color is **8**, so it is the background.\n\n2. **Remove marker color**  \n   Color **4** behaves like a marker/irrelevant pixel: it never appears in the outputs of the examples.  \n   So we treat **4 as background** (delete it before extracting pieces).\n\n3. **Extract the \u201cpieces\u201d**  \n   Find every **4-connected component** of non-background cells (colors other than 8, and after removing 4).  \n   For each component, **crop it to its tight bounding box**.  \n   This produces several rectangular tiles made from colors **9** and **3**.\n\n4. **Assemble tiles by matching edge patterns**  \n   The tiles are cut so that adjacent tiles have **identical boundary rows/columns**.  \n   Build the final picture by:\n   - Starting with the unique tile whose **entire left edge is 9** (this must be the far-left tile).\n   - Repeatedly placing the next tile to the right whose **left column equals the current tile\u2019s right column**.\n   - On the far right, two smaller tiles stack vertically (their touching row is identical), forming a full-height right column whose **right edge is all 9**.\n\n   This yields one combined rectangle of size **7\u00d716**.\n\n5. **Place the assembled rectangle in the output grid**  \n   As in both examples, place the final rectangle so it sits **2 cells away from the bottom and 2 cells away from the right edge**, filling the rest with background **8**.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Solving an ARC Task with Block Assembly**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given some input examples and need to figure out the rule. The examples involve grids, colored backgrounds, and distinct objects within the grid. It seems like the task is about taking these objects and rearranging or combining them. My thought process is to meticulously dissect these examples, identify patterns, and formulate a general solution.\n\nFirst, I examine the first example. I start by pinpointing the background color, and then I try to identify the objects. Initially, I think about connected components, but I'm looking for a more structural approach. It becomes clear that each object has a unique shape and a collection of colors, and I can identify the pieces through the colors. Hints about a yellow color that appears only in the input and is removed in output immediately grab my attention. In this example, I am noticing the distinct \"islands\" of non-background colors within the grid, and I analyze how these \"islands\" are transformed into the output. I also realize that the output is not a direct copy of any input pieces, but rather a derived structure that's assembled from the pieces. My early hypothesis is that the input contains fragmented pieces of a larger image that needs to be assembled.\n\nI then move on to the second example. I immediately check for the yellow color, which is a key element, and try to find the components. In this case, the objects are more obvious. By examining the input and the output, it becomes clear that there is a permutation or rearranging of the input blocks. I quickly come up with an hypothesis of matching borders, as the image looks like blocks that are connected. The yellow color in one of the quadrants implies a special position for it, or it shows an orientation.\n\nThe critical observation from the second example is that the objects aren't just placed as they are in the input, but are possibly rotated or transposed. This makes me consider edge-matching as a potential rule. The task involves: finding 4 blocks, possibly with a \"noisy\" yellow block, assembling the blocks into a 2x2 arrangement.\n\nI go back to the first example and reevaluate based on my insights. It's not about fragments; it's about finding specific elements within the input and constructing something. In this example, the assembly seems to happen at a higher level than just quadrants. The output is like a combination of the input.\n\nTo test my rule, I move to the test input. My rule is: Find the parts. Discard the yellow part, as well as the other pieces that don't fit based on edge color matching. The input is then made up of three horizontal strips (A-B-C/D). To test it, I need to extract the parts and then connect them based on edge colors. The output is a central object, surrounded by a background. I analyze edge color matching - A-B- C/D and identify the pattern for making an object.\n\nIn the end, I realize that it's all about edge matching and forming the best-fitting object.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a single coherent object from fragmented parts scattered in the input grid. Based on the solved examples, the process involves:\n1.  **Identifying Candidate Blocks:** The input contains multiple disconnected blocks of colored pixels.\n2.  **Filtering Noise:** One block contains yellow pixels (color 4). The hint and examples indicate that yellow is a marker/noise and should be removed, but the block itself (or the clean part of it) is likely part of the solution. Other blocks might be distractors, but in this case, it appears we need to assemble specific matching blocks.\n3.  **Assembly (Puzzle Matching):** The correct blocks can be assembled to form a single, rectangular, framed object. We can determine the correct arrangement by matching the patterns on the edges of the blocks (e.g., the right column of the left block should match the left column of the middle block).\n4.  **Placement:** The assembled object is placed centrally in the output grid.\n\n**Analysis of the Test Input:**\nWe extract the candidate blocks and analyze their edge patterns:\n\n*   **Block A (Top Left in Input, rows 3-9, cols 0-3):** Size 7x3.\n    *   Rightmost column: `9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9`.\n*   **Block B (Top Middle in Input, rows 1-7, cols 6-9):** Size 7x4.\n    *   Leftmost column: `9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9`. **Matches Block A Right!**\n    *   Rightmost column: `9, 9, 9, 3, 3, 9, 9`.\n*   **Block C (Top Right in Input, rows 2-6, cols 15-17 + yellow noise):** Height 5, Width 3. After removing yellow:\n    *   Content rows: `9,9,9`, `9,9,9`, `9,3,9`, `3,3,9`, `3,3,9`.\n    *   Leftmost column: `9, 9, 9, 3, 3`. **Matches the top 5 rows of Block B Right.**\n*   **Block D (Bottom Middle in Input, rows 13-14, cols 13-15):** The bottom part of the block at this location (rows 13-14) fits the pattern.\n    *   Content rows: `9,3,3`, `9,9,9`.\n    *   Leftmost column: `9, 9`. **Matches the bottom 2 rows of Block B Right.**\n\n**Assembly:**\n*   **Left Strip:** Block A (7x3).\n*   **Middle Strip:** Block B (7x4).\n*   **Right Strip:** Block C stacked on top of Block D (Total 7x3).\n    *   C is the top 5 rows.\n    *   D is the bottom 2 rows.\n\n**Object Construction (7 rows x 10 columns):**\n*   **Row 0:** `9,9,9` (A) + `9,9,9,9` (B) + `9,9,9` (C) = `9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9`\n*   **Row 1:** `9,3,3` (A) + `3,3,9,9` (B) + `9,9,9` (C) = `9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9`\n*   **Row 2:** `9,3,9` (A) + `9,3,9,9` (B) + `9,3,9` (C) = `9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,9`\n*   **Row 3:** `9,3,3` (A) + `3,3,3,3` (B) + `3,3,9` (C) = `9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9`\n*   **Row 4:** `9,3,9` (A) + `9,3,3,3` (B) + `3,3,9` (C) = `9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9`\n*   **Row 5:** `9,3,3` (A) + `3,3,9,9` (B) + `9,3,3` (D) = `9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3`\n*   **Row 6:** `9,9,9` (A) + `9,9,9,9` (B) + `9,9,9` (D) = `9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9`\n\nThe result is a 10x7 object with a solid border of 9s (except for a few pixels in the inner pattern touching the border, which is consistent with the matching).\n\n**Final Output:**\nThe grid is 20x20. We place the 10x7 object near the center.\nVertical centering: (20 - 7) / 2 = 6.5 -> Row 6.\nHorizontal centering: (20 - 10) / 2 = 5 -> Column 5.\nBackground is filled with 8.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so the task at hand is to solve an ARC puzzle based on two examples and a test input. Let's break this down. From analyzing the examples, I can see that the objective is to take a set of input shapes and assemble them into a single, cohesive output object. It seems that \"yellow\" shapes are noise to be ignored, and the background color can also be ignored.\n\nMy initial thought is that the output might be a straightforward combination of input pieces, possibly overlapping or adjoining them. This is further clarified by the hints that say something about an \"assembled\" object. Then, I realized the output can be a completed version of just ONE object, but it's *reconstructed* using other pieces found in the input.\n\nIn example 1, the output is a single rectangle with internal structure (0, 2 colors), while the input contains several separate shapes. It seems there is a *relationship* between the input and output. The task is to discover that relationship and apply it to the test input.\n\nI noticed that the outputs in the examples follow a pattern, so let's call that pattern *frame*. The outer structure follows this pattern, and we use that to find and join the objects together.\n\nIn example 2, I can see a more clear example of *assembled* object that is framed. There is symmetry in the example, and some shape mirroring is involved as well.\n\nThe test input contains a variety of fragmented shapes. Some of them appear to overlap others, but this is a distraction: the objective is to *construct* the object based on *the pattern* in the examples.\n\nFrom analyzing the inputs in the examples, I see that this is the process: \n1.  **Eliminate the Noise:** Ignore anything \"yellow\" and all objects attached to yellow parts.\n2.  **Identify Pieces:** Focus on the non-yellow shapes (connected components).\n3.  **Frame Check:** The pieces will be composed of an object that has a specific color pattern (frame)\n4.  **Assembly Rule:** Determine an assembly approach (overlap, adjoining, etc.).\n5.  **Output Alignment:** Determine the location and how to center the object.\n \nIn the examples, I noticed that the pieces fit each other to create the objects.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a complete object from fragmented parts scattered in the input grid. The \"yellow\" colored shapes are indicated to be noise, but they often obscure or attach to valid parts of the object. The goal is to identify the valid non-yellow parts, assemble them into a single coherent rectangular object, and place it in the center of a clean background.\n\n**Analysis of the Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Components:**\n    *   **Left Piece (P1):** A 7x3 strip located at columns 0-2, rows 3-9.\n        *   Pattern: Frame of 9s on Left/Top/Bottom. Inside is mixed 3s and 9s.\n    *   **Center Piece (P2):** A 7x4 strip located at columns 6-9, rows 1-7.\n        *   Pattern: Top/Bottom 9s. Left matches P1's right edge.\n    *   **Right Piece Parts:**\n        *   **Top Part (P_Yellow):** Located in the top-right cluster (rows 2-5, cols 15-18). It is attached to yellow (4) noise. We remove the yellow pixels (4) and keep the remaining valid structure (colors 9 and 3). This yields a 4x3 piece (rows 0-3 of the cluster).\n        *   **Bottom Part (P5):** A 3x3 piece located at columns 11-13, rows 17-19.\n        *   Together, P_Yellow (4 rows) and P5 (3 rows) form a 7-row high strip that acts as the right side of the object.\n\n2.  **Assembly Logic:**\n    *   **Height:** All main components (P1, P2) and the combined Right Piece have a height of 7.\n    *   **Connections:**\n        *   **P1 + P2:** P1 is 3 wide, P2 is 4 wide. The rightmost column of P1 (9,3,9,3,9,3,9) matches perfectly with the leftmost column of P2. They overlap by 1 column.\n        *   **P2 + Right Piece:** The Right Piece (P_Yellow + P5) creates a 3-wide strip. It does not overlap with P2 (based on mismatched edges for overlap), but when placed adjacent to P2, it completes the pattern and forms a solid 9-frame on the right edge.\n    *   **Final Dimensions:**\n        *   Width: P1 (3) + P2 (4) - 1 (overlap) + Right Piece (3) = 9 columns.\n        *   Height: 7 rows.\n\n3.  **Constructed Object (9x7):**\n\n    *   **Row 0:** `9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9` (Solid frame)\n    *   **Row 1:** `9,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,9`\n    *   **Row 2:** `9,3,9,3,9,9,3,3,9`\n    *   **Row 3:** `9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9`\n    *   **Row 4:** `9,3,9,3,3,3,3,3,9`\n    *   **Row 5:** `9,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,9`\n    *   **Row 6:** `9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9` (Solid frame)\n\n4.  **Placement:**\n    *   The object is centered in the 20x20 grid. A 9x7 object roughly centers at starting Row 6, Column 5.\n\n**Output Generation:**\nThe background is filled with 8 (teal). The constructed object is placed centrally.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,9,9,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation rule from the examples:\n\n**Example Analysis:**\n- Example 1: Multiple disconnected fragments in input. Yellow (4) appears near some fragments. Output shows one complete framed object (7-bordered rectangle with 0s and 2s inside) centered in the grid.\n- Example 2: Similar pattern - multiple fragments with yellow marking noise. Output is one complete 3-bordered rectangle with 9s inside, centered.\n\n**Key Rules:**\n1. Find disconnected \"candidate\" objects in the input\n2. Yellow (4) marks noise/incorrect fragments - exclude these\n3. Keep the correct framed multi-color object\n4. Complete its borders if needed\n5. Center the result in the output grid\n\n**Analyzing Test Input:**\n\nYellow (4) appears at positions (1,17), (1,18), (2,18) - marking the top-right fragment as noise.\n\nThe largest non-yellow fragment is at rows 1-7, cols 6-9:\n```\n9,9,9,9\n3,3,9,9\n9,3,9,9\n3,3,3,3\n9,3,3,3\n3,3,9,9\n9,9,9,9\n```\n\nThis has complete top/bottom borders (all 9s) but incomplete left/right borders.

            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Background / noise removal**\n   - The background is the most common color: **8**.\n   - **Yellow (4)** appears only as noise/marker in inputs and is **removed** (treated as background 8).\n\n2. **Find the single \u201cframed\u201d object pieces**\n   - All remaining non-background cells (here colors **9** and **3**) form several **disconnected rectangular fragments**.\n   - The **frame color** is the color that forms full straight borders on some fragments; here that is **9** (it forms complete border edges on the leftmost and rightmost parts once assembled).\n\n3. **Reconstruct the framed object by tiling the fragments**\n   - One right-edge column is split into two fragments that must be **stacked vertically** to make the full height:\n     - a **4\u00d73** piece on top (has full top border and full right border of 9),\n     - a **3\u00d73** piece on bottom (has full bottom border and full right border of 9),\n     - stacked \u2192 a **7\u00d73** \u201cright side\u201d segment.\n   - The only **7\u00d73** piece with a full **left** border of 9 is the **left side** segment.\n   - The remaining full-height fragments are middle segments. Their **edge columns match exactly** in a chain, which determines their left-to-right order.\n   - Concatenating all segments yields one **7\u00d716** framed rectangle (bordered by 9).\n\n4. **Canonical placement**\n   - Create an output grid of the **same size** filled with background **8**.\n   - Place the reconstructed object so its **bottom-right corner sits at (H\u22122, W\u22122)** (i.e., leave a **2-cell margin** on the bottom and right), exactly as in the examples.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

Describe the observable structures**\n\nDescribe what you see **without guessing** the rule:\n\n* What objects exist? (shapes, colors, connected components)\n* How are they arranged? (locations, orientations, bounding boxes)\n* What changes from input to output? (additions, removals, movements)\n* What stays the same? (stable background, preserved shapes)\n\nBe very literal and avoid hypothesizing here.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\nFor each, say \u201cpresent\u201d, \u201cmaybe\u201d, or \u201cabsent\u201d:\n\n* **Object movement**\n* **Object recoloring**\n* **Bordering / outlining**\n* **Filling holes or cavities**\n* **Removing noise / extracting main shape**\n* **Copying / pasting / repositioning**\n* **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**\n* **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**\n* **Size-based filtering or selection**\n* **Symmetry or reflection operations**\n* **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**\n* **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**\n\nThis helps narrow down plausible rule families.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\nList 3\u20136 insights that are **crucial and not immediately obvious**.\nExamples of the kind of insights to extract:\n\n* \u201cOnly the *largest* blue cluster receives a border; smaller ones are ignored.\u201d\n* \u201cNew colors in the output correspond to *inside* regions of hollow shapes.\u201d\n* \u201cThe transformation only acts on objects touching the top edge.\u201d\n* \u201cThe rule depends on which color appears in the **top-left tile** of the input.\u201d\n* \u201cObjects are replaced with templated icons depending on their color.\u201d\n* \u201cInternal holes are treated as objects and recolored independently.\u201d\n\nFocus on the subtle but general behavior.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nIn 2\u20134 sentences, propose a **general transformation mechanism** that would explain the mapping *across inputs and outputs*.\n\nAvoid low-level pixel descriptions; describe conceptual behavior.\n\nExample styles:\n\n* \u201cThe task identifies hollow shapes and outlines them in red while recoloring their interior according to hole depth.\u201d\n* \u201cThe task compresses all meaningful objects to the top-left quadrant while preserving their original shapes.\u201d\n* \u201cAll scattered singletons are deleted and replaced by large structured blocks based on color frequency.\u201d\n\nIf ambiguous, propose the *two or three* most likely rule families.\n\n---\n\n## **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\nGive 3\u20135 quick algorithmic checks for validation, e.g.:\n\n* \u201cVerify whether recoloring depends on hole depth or on adjacency to perimeter.\u201d\n* \u201cCheck if the anchor color is always the top-left non-background pixel.\u201d\n* \u201cTest whether clusters are preserved or converted into icons.\u201d\n* \u201cDetermine whether the largest cluster always receives the transformation.\u201d\n\nThese guide a solver toward the correct general rule.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nIn 3-4 bullet points, give the distilled essence \u2014 short, hard, and generalizable.\n**IMPORTANT: Start this section with the exact line `HINT_START` and end it with the exact line `HINT_END`.**\n\nExample:\nHINT_START\n* The task outlines certain shapes using a new color.\n* Only shapes with internal cavities are processed.\n* Inner cavities receive a secondary recolor distinct from the border.\nHINT_END\n",

Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement**: **present** (the kept object ends up in a more canonical/central placement rather than staying where it was)\n- **Object recoloring**: **absent** (colors in the remaining object match input colors)\n- **Bordering / outlining**: **absent** (frames/borders already exist; not newly added in an obvious way)\n- **Filling holes or cavities**: **maybe** (some kept objects look like \u201ccompleted\u201d framed icons; unclear if completion occurs or if a complete one is simply selected)\n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape**: **present** (many components removed; one retained)\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning**: **present** (retained object appears re-placed rather than left in situ)\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**: **maybe** (outputs suggest a consistent placement like centering)\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**: **maybe** (yellow appears as a rare \u201cmarker/noise\u201d color and disappears)\n- **Size-based filtering or selection**: **maybe** (one object is selected from several; could be based on size/shape regularity)\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations**: **absent**\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**: **absent**\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**: **absent** (objects remain \u201cobject-like\u201d; not converted into a different symbol set)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **A small yellow component appears in both inputs but never survives to the output**, suggesting yellow is either pure noise or a selection marker rather than part of the constructed result.\n2. **Outputs consistently contain exactly one multi-color \u201cframed icon\u201d**, while inputs contain multiple disconnected candidates (and sometimes extra stray parts).\n3. **No recoloring is evident**: the output object\u2019s palette is a **subset of input colors**, implying selection/aggregation rather than mapping colors.\n4. The retained object is **repositioned to a canonical location** (visually near the center with padding), implying the task is not \u201cedit in place\u201d but \u201cextract and present.\u201d\n5. The object that remains looks like a **regular, axis-aligned rectangular/square frame containing an interior pattern**; other components include partial pieces/variants that are discarded, implying **selection by structural regularity** (or by being the \u201ccomplete\u201d exemplar among variants).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nMost likely, the transformation **selects a single \u201ctarget\u201d framed object** (a regular rectangle/square outline containing an interior pattern) from among several disconnected components, **removes all other components** (including the yellow marker), and then **repositions the selected object** into a standard placement (often near the center) on the same background.\n\nA close alternative family is that the output framed object is a **composite formed by overlaying/merging multiple similar candidate frames** after alignment; however, from the sketches it also plausibly matches a direct selection of the \u201ccomplete\u201d candidate.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks you would perform when solving\n\n1. **Component match check**: For each connected component in the input, test whether translating it (no rotation) can exactly reproduce the output object.\n2. **\u201cComplete frame\u201d test**: For each candidate object, check if its outline forms a **closed rectangle/square ring** (no missing boundary pixels) and whether the output always corresponds to that candidate.\n3. **Yellow-marker relation test**: Measure which object is **nearest/farthest/aligned** with the yellow pixel; see if that predicts the chosen component.\n4. **Overlay hypothesis test**: Align similarly sized framed components by their bounding boxes and take a **union overlay**; compare the result to the output.\n5. **Placement rule test**: Determine whether final placement is **true centering**, top-left anchoring, or anchoring to some detected reference (grid center, largest margin, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* Inputs contain multiple disconnected candidates; outputs keep **only one** framed, multi-color object and delete everything else.\n* **Yellow appears only in inputs** and is removed in outputs (likely noise/marker).\n* The kept object\u2019s **colors are preserved** (no recoloring); output uses a subset of input colors.\n* The remaining object is **repositioned to a canonical location** (visually near the center with padding), suggesting extraction + placement rather than in-place editing.\nHINT_END",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into a Complex Pattern**\n\nAlright, the task at hand is to decode this ARC problem based on two examples and a test input. It looks like I'm dealing with assembling fragmented \"containers\". My initial hunch is that these containers are rectangles with distinctive borders and internal patterns, and the trick is to identify the parts and reassemble them correctly.\n\nMy first thought is to dive into Example 1. I notice that it's a 12x20 grid with a teal background (8). I see two main fragments, each with an orange border (7) and a split interior. One fragment shows a black (0) top and red (2) bottom, the other the opposite. The output then seems to combine these fragments to make one large rectangle. The key is in the overlapping \"shards.\"\n\nThe borders are crucial; they act like boundaries for the \"shards\". I'm tracing the fragments' width, height, and content. It's a jigsaw! The output grid's pattern is like \"shards\" reassembled. So, let's explore this further.\n\nI observe in Example 2, the border color changes to green (3), and the internal fill is maroon (9). The goal remains to stitch these parts back together in a larger shape, 6x6. This reveals that the grid's background and scattered blocks are noise, I am to only consider the rectangular objects. I'm focusing on \"border color\" and \"fill color\" to extract \"fragments\".\n\nThe test input is 20x20 and now my task is to reassemble it in a square container.\nI note the border color is maroon (9) and the \"fill\" color is green (3). I identify a left-side piece (border-left), right-side piece(border-right). The fill in the fragments looks like 3s, but some 9s are scattered, is this a symmetric object? I start listing down the blocks. I notice several \"shards\" with maroon (9) borders and green(3) fills.\n\nNow comes the tough part. I'm struggling with the assembly logic. It's like finding the right pieces in a puzzle. Is there an overlap, or do they tile? I will use all my information from previous examples and input text to identify and build the complete rectangular container. I will use the \"shards\" to identify the dimensions of the final container.\n\nI believe I have the strategy:\n1.  Identify the border color, which looks to be 9 in the test input.\n2.  Find fill, is it solid or alternating?\n3.  Based on border and shape of the block I extract \"Shards\".\n4.  Fit the \"shards\" into a rectangle based on their features.\n5.  Remove \"noise\".\n\nIt looks like I might have a width 6. 7 height for the container to match the height of the extracted shards. The pattern 3,3,9 and 3,9,3 looks like an overlap may be occurring, it might or might not be true. The overlap would explain a pattern in between the two shards. Let me reconstruct my pattern one more time. The fill patterns (3,3 vs 3,9 vs 9,3) will be the most defining to rebuild the container.\n\nIn the Test Input, there's a clear 'Left Shard'. Based on this Left Shard and pattern, a second Right Shard can be reconstructed. The total width will be 5, not 6. Width will be 5, height is fixed based on the Shard to be 7. Now I will place the final 5x7 object in the center of the grid, that should be easy.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a complete rectangular container from \"shards\" or fragments scattered in the input grid. We treat 8 as the background color.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   Input contains fragmented parts of a container with border color 7. The interior contains 0s (top half) and 2s (bottom half).\n    *   Output is a single, centered, complete container. It combines the features of the fragments: a 7-border rectangle, split horizontally, with 0s on top and 2s on the bottom. The width and height are inferred from the assembled pieces.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   Input contains four 3x3 fragments. They have border color 3 and interior 9.\n    *   The fragments represent the four corners (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) of a larger container.\n    *   Output is a single 6x6 container (concatenating the 3x3 pieces) centered in the grid. The border is 3, fill is 9.\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\n*   **Shards:** We identify fragments with border color **9** and interior fill **3** (with some internal noise patterns).\n    *   **Left Side Shard:** Found around rows 3-9, col 0-2 (and similar fragments elsewhere). It shows a Left Border (9) and Fill (3). The fill pattern alternates rows.\n        *   Pattern (excluding border): `3,3` then `3,9`.\n    *   **Right Side Shard:** Found around rows 1-7, col 6-9 (and similar fragments). It shows a Right Border (9) and Fill (3).\n        *   Pattern (excluding border): `3,3` then `9,3`.\n*   **Reconstruction:**\n    *   **Height:** The fragments are 7 rows high (including top and bottom borders).\n    *   **Width:** The Left Shard has a 1-pixel border and 2-pixel fill. The Right Shard has a 2-pixel fill and a border (appearing as 1 or 2 pixels). Concatenating the fill sections (`3,3` from left and `3,3` from right) gives a 4-pixel wide interior.\n    *   **Fill Pattern:**\n        *   Rows 1, 3, 5 (internal): Left `3,3` + Right `3,3` = `3,3,3,3`.\n        *   Rows 2, 4 (internal): Left `3,9` + Right `9,3` = `3,9,9,3`.\n    *   **Borders:** We normalize the border to 1 pixel width (color 9).\n    *   **Total Size:** 1 (Left Border) + 4 (Fill) + 1 (Right Border) = **6 columns wide**. Height is **7 rows**.\n*   **Placement:** The object should be centered in the 20x20 output grid.\n    *   Vertical: (20 - 7) / 2 = 6.5. We place it starting at **Row 6** (occupying rows 6-12).\n    *   Horizontal: (20 - 6) / 2 = 7. We place it starting at **Column 7** (occupying columns 7-12).\n\n**Generated Object:**\nRows 0/6 (Top/Bot): `9,9,9,9,9,9`\nRows 1,3,5 (Fill): `9,3,3,3,3,9`\nRows 2,4 (Fill): `9,3,9,9,3,9`\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   Initialize 20x20 grid with 8s.\n*   Draw the 6x7 object at (Row 6, Col 7).\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Approach to this ARC Task:**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this ARC problem. The user wants me to reconstruct a grid, essentially \"stitching\" together pieces of it. The examples are crucial here. I see it as a pattern recognition and spatial reasoning problem.\n\n**Analysis & Strategy**\n\n*   **Grid Format:** It's all about 2D grids, integer values from 0-9.\n*   **The Big Picture:** Transform the \"broken\" input into a unified output.\n*   **Examples Guide:** I'm using the examples to understand how to handle the inputs. Example 1 has separated container elements that I need to merge into a single, complete container. Example 2 shows assembling corner fragments into a larger whole.\n*   **Instructions:** \"Translate and tile these fragments\" means I have to identify, move, and combine parts, while removing unwanted elements.\n*   **Goals:** Reconstruct to find the pattern and its interior, while considering \"noise\" and \"solid blocks\".\n\n**Deep Dive into the Examples**\n\n*   **Example 1 Breakdown:** Analyzing Example 1, I find scattered pieces of a container with a border of 7, 8 background, and some internal regions of `0` and `2`. It's about putting the pieces together to get a clean container.\n*   **Example 2 Breakdown:** Example 2 introduces 3x3 square blocks with border 3. There are some \"solid blocks\" (4s), which are noise that have to be removed, and that the interior fragments are parts of a complete container.\n*   **Test Input:** The Test Input is 20x20 and contains these elements. I see the border color is `9` and the background is `8`. I will translate to reconstruct the pattern\n\n**Test Input Analysis**\n\n*   **Grid Scans:** The Test Input is full of fragments, which is where the real work begins. By scanning row-by-row and tracing the borders, I'm trying to identify the 9s, looking for the container edges. I have identified parts of what seems to be a Left, Middle, and Right strip of elements and will need to merge them.\n*   **Object Properties** I identified the fragments:\n    *   Top-left: appears to be the left side of a box, border is 9, interior fill is 3.\n    *   Middle elements: Might be a top and right side.\n    *   Right side has pieces too, that together will make a box.\n    *   Bottom-left appears to be a corner that matches.\n    *   Bottom-right is another corner.\n\n**Hypothesis**\n\n*   **The Overall Goal:** There's a 7-row-high rectangular shape with a border of 9 and an interior of 3 that I need to assemble. I'll need to figure out which pieces fit where, by looking at their edge characteristics.\n*   **Border Color is 9 and Interior is 3** I am going to ignore the numbers 4 and 8.\n\n**Building the Container (The Process)**\n\n*   I'll need to create a list of the pixels/colors that make up the container fragments and match their border characteristics\n*   By finding the borders and matching them, I will place the fragments into place,\n*   I can also compare the known fragment characteristics and the expected form, given example data.\n*   The final pattern is a 8x7-box in the center of the 20x20 grid with the right interior elements and borders.\n*   I will place the solution at grid position (6,6) (7x7 box)\n*   I will verify all border elements, and final interior and border characteristics.\n\n**Verification and Validation**\n\n*   **Test Cases:** I'm double-checking the example structure, especially the parts labeled \"noise\" by comparing the inputs to known elements from the solved examples.\n*   **Pattern Matching:** The heart of this is about the placement of all elements relative to each other, to establish all matching parts and to create the required reconstructed elements.\n*   **The `4` element from all examples is removed since this is a requirement. I also have to assume that the `9` inside the container interior is not noise and represents a feature.**\n\n**The Output**\n\nI will now construct the final reconstructed grid, centered in the Test Input grid to produce my solution. This will give the correct solution to the task.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a single large rectangular container from scattered fragments, removing extraneous solid blocks (distractors). We treat 8 as the background.\n\n**1. Analysis of Objects and Fragments:**\n*   **Target Object:** A container with **border color 9** and **interior fill 3**. This is inferred from the fragments having 9s on the edges and 3s inside.\n*   **Distractors:** The solid blocks of 4s are extraneous and should be ignored/removed.\n*   **Fragments:** We identify several disjoint pieces in the input grid that look like parts of the container (corners, edges).\n    *   **Left Strip (L):** A 7x3 block at the top-left (Rows 3-9, Cols 0-2). It has a full left border of 9s and top/bottom borders of 9s. Height = 7.\n    *   **Middle Strip (M):** A 7x4 block in the middle (Rows 1-7, Cols 6-9). It has top/bottom borders of 9s.\n    *   **Right Strip (R):** Composed of a Top-Right (TR) piece at Cols 15-17 (Rows 2-5) and a Bottom-Right (LR) piece at Cols 13-15 (Rows 10-14). These pieces align to form the right side of the container.\n\n**2. Reconstruction (Stitching):**\nWe need to \"Translate and tile\" these strips to form one coherent box. The height is determined by the Left and Middle strips, which are 7 rows high.\n\n*   **Height:** 7 rows.\n*   **Stitching Left and Middle:**\n    *   The rightmost column of the Left Strip (Col 2 relative) matches the leftmost column of the Middle Strip (Col 0 relative).\n    *   Pattern: `9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9` (vertical zipper).\n    *   Overlap is 1 column.\n*   **Stitching Middle and Right:**\n    *   The rightmost column of the Middle Strip (Col 3 relative) matches the leftmost column of the Right pieces (TR Col 0 / LR Col 0).\n    *   Pattern: `9, 9, 9, 3, 3, 9, 9`.\n    *   Overlap is 1 column.\n*   **Total Width:**\n    *   Left Strip: 3 columns.\n    *   Middle Strip: 4 columns.\n    *   Right Strip: 3 columns.\n    *   Two overlaps of 1 column each.\n    *   Calculation: $3 + 4 + 3 - 1 - 1 = 8$ columns.\n\n**3. Assembled Box Content (8x7):**\nWe assemble the rows based on the fragments.\n*   **Row 0 (Top):** `9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9` (All borders).\n*   **Row 1:** L(1)+M(1..2)+R(1). `9, 3, 3, 3, 9, 9, 3, 9`.\n*   **Row 2:** L(2)+M(1..2)+R(1). `9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 9, 3, 9`.\n*   **Row 3:** L(3)+M(1..2)+R(1). `9, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9`.\n*   **Row 4:** L(4)+M(1..2)+R(1). `9, 3, 9, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9`.\n*   **Row 5:** L(5)+M(1..2)+R(1). `9, 3, 3, 3, 9, 9, 3, 9`.\n*   **Row 6 (Bottom):** `9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9` (All borders).\n\n**4. Final Output Generation:**\n*   Create a 20x20 grid filled with background color 8.\n*   Place the reconstructed 8x7 box centered in the grid.\n    *   Vertical centering: (20 - 7) / 2 = 6.5 -> Start at Row 6.\n    *   Horizontal centering: (20 - 8) / 2 = 6 -> Start at Col 6.\n\nOutput Grid:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

Objects: Simple Rectangular Containers (border color: 3, 7, 9; interior fill: 0, 2, 3, 9); Partitioned Containers (border 7, divided, top: 0+noise, bottom: 2+noise); Solid Blocks (4, 9).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Treat **8** as background; everything not used becomes **8**.  \n- Remove extraneous solid blocks (notably **4**).  \n- Extract rectangular container fragments using border colors (**7** in Ex1, **3** in Ex2) and their interior fills (**0/2** or **9**).  \n- Translate and tile these fragments to reconstruct one larger container:  \n  - Ex2: four **3\u00d73** corner tiles \u2192 2\u00d72 mosaic \u2192 **6\u00d76** container (border **3**, fill **9**).  \n  - Ex1: combine a main partitioned **7** container with additional **7/0** (top) and **7/2** (bottom) strips; align borders/divider and fill/bridge gaps with **7** on borders and **0/2** inside.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Background color is 8**. The output is mostly 8; anything not used in the reconstruction is cleared to 8.\n2. **Remove extraneous solid blocks**, especially color **4** (they never appear in the reconstructed container in the examples).\n3. The remaining non-background colors form **rectangular \u201ccontainer fragments\u201d** with:\n   - **Border color = 9**\n   - **Interior color = 3** (with some 9 \u201cnoise\u201d inside)\n4. **Extract the rectangular fragments** (as full rectangles), then **rebuild one larger container** by **tiling/concatenating** them:\n   - Several fragments are **7 rows tall**, so the reconstructed container is **height 7**.\n   - The top-right area contains a fragment contaminated by 4s; after removing 4, it yields a **4\u00d73** rectangle. The bottom-right contains a **3\u00d73** rectangle. **Stack these** to make the final **7\u00d73 right-end strip** (with a full right border of 9).\n   - The horizontal order of strips is determined by matching edge-column patterns (right edge of one equals left edge of the next), giving:\n     **Left strip \u2192 7\u00d74 strip \u2192 7\u00d73 strip \u2192 7\u00d73 strip \u2192 right strip**.\n   - This produces a final container of size **7\u00d716**.\n5. **Place the reconstructed container** so that its **bottom-right corner is 2 cells away** from the grid\u2019s bottom and right edges (as in both examples).  \n   For a 20\u00d720 grid, that means the container occupies **rows 12\u201318** and **cols 3\u201318**.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the two solved examples)\n\n1. **Background is color `8`**. Anything not part of the reconstructed object becomes `8`.\n2. **Remove extraneous solid blocks** (here, the `4`s).\n3. The remaining non-background cells form several **rectangular fragments** of one larger \u201ccontainer\u201d:\n   - Here the \u201ccontainer\u201d uses **border color `9`** and **interior color `3`**.\n4. **Reconstruct one big rectangle by tiling the fragments (translation only, no rotation)**:\n   - In this test input, the non-`8`/non-`4` pixels form rectangles of sizes:\n     - `7\u00d73` (three pieces),\n     - `7\u00d74` (one piece),\n     - `4\u00d73` and `3\u00d73` (these stack vertically to make another `7\u00d73` piece).\n   - Total area = `112`, so the final rectangle is `7\u00d716`.\n5. **Find left-to-right strip order by matching side-edge columns** (right edge of one strip equals left edge of the next). This yields a unique chain of strips.\n6. **Place the final reconstructed rectangle with a 2-cell margin to the bottom and right**, as in both examples.  \n   For a `20\u00d720` grid and a `7\u00d716` rectangle, the rectangle occupies **rows 11\u201317** and **cols 2\u201317**.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

                "response": "**Analyzing and Describing Grid Objects**\n\nOkay, so the task is to describe the object types found in these grids, without guessing at any rules or relationships, and using only numeric color values.  I need to provide a concise summary within specified tags. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to look closely at each grid and identify the basic building blocks.  I see a consistent background color (8).  Now, what are the distinct objects? It looks like the primary objects are rectangular, and they often have a defined border color (3, 7, 9, occasionally 4) that encloses an interior fill.  The interiors can be either solid with a single fill color (3, 9) or a more complex configuration.\n\nLooking closer, in grids 2 and 5, I observe a specific type of container with a border color 7. These particular containers are divided horizontally, where the upper portion is usually color 0 (with a few scattered color 7 pixels, which I'll call \"noise\") and the lower portion is usually color 2 (also with scattered color 7 noise).\n\nIn some grids (like 4), there are smaller, solid rectangular blocks made of a single color (4 or 9) that look like individual shapes.\n\nSo, the types of things I can describe are: a background, rectangular containers that can be simple or partitioned, and small solid blocks. The rectangular containers have a border color, and inside, a fill color. The partitioned ones also have a split interior and noise.\n\nTo be concise, here's what I came up with:\n`<objects_summary>Background: 8.  Objects: Simple Rectangular Containers (border color: 3, 7, 9; interior fill: 0, 2, 3, 9); Partitioned Containers (border 7, divided, top: 0+noise, bottom: 2+noise); Solid Blocks (4, 9). </objects_summary>`\n\n\nBased on the visual data provided, the grids feature the following types of objects and attributes:\n\n**1. Background**\n*   The entire canvas of every grid is filled with a uniform background field of **color 8**. All other objects exist on top of or within this field.\n\n**2. Rectangular Containers**\n*   The most prominent objects are rectangular structures defined by a 1-pixel wide outer border.\n*   **Simple Containers:**\n    *   These objects have a border of one color and a solid interior fill of a different color.\n    *   Observed combinations include a border of **color 3** with an interior of **color 9**, or a border of **color 9** with an interior of **color 3**.\n*   **Partitioned Containers:**\n    *   These are specific rectangular objects defined by a border of **color 7**.\n    *   **Internal Structure:** They are often divided horizontally by a row of **color 7**, creating a top compartment and a bottom compartment.\n    *   **Fills:** The top compartment is typically filled with **color 0**, and the bottom compartment is typically filled with **color 2**.\n    *   **Inclusions:** Inside the **color 0** and **color 2** regions, there are often isolated single pixels of the border color (**color 7**) scattered within the fill.\n\n**3. Solid Blocks**\n*   There are smaller, solid rectangular shapes that do not have a distinct border/fill separation.\n*   These appear as small patches (e.g., 2x2 squares or small vertical bars) of a single color, such as **color 4** or **color 9**.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Color 8.\n2. Simple Containers: Rectangles with a border (e.g., color 3, 9) and a contrasting solid interior (e.g., color 9, 3).\n3. Partitioned Containers: Rectangles with a border of color 7, divided horizontally into top (color 0) and bottom (color 2) sections, containing scattered pixels of color 7.\n4. Solid Blocks: Small, uniform rectangles of color 4 or 9.\n</objects_summary>",

                "response": "### Common / Global transformations seen\n1. **Background normalization**\n   - Color **8** is treated as background.\n   - In the output, any cell not belonging to the constructed final object(s) is set to **8**.\n\n2. **Object filtering / deletion**\n   - Solid blocks or \u201cnoise\u201d objects (notably color **4**) are **removed** (changed to **8**) if they are not part of the final assembled container.\n   - Any extra non-8 pixels not used in the reconstruction are also removed.\n\n3. **Extract container fragments by border/fill**\n   - Identify rectangular \u201ccontainer\u201d fragments using:\n     - **Border colors**: **3** or **7** (seen in examples)\n     - **Interior/fill colors**: **0**, **2**, **9** (seen in examples)\n   - Use each fragment\u2019s bounding box as a \u201ctile\u201d (sometimes after trimming away irrelevant attached pixels).\n\n4. **Translation (repositioning) of extracted fragments**\n   - Selected fragments are **moved (translated)** to new coordinates in order to assemble a single coherent container in the output.\n   - At least one fragment may act as an **anchor** (kept in place), with other fragments moved relative to it.\n\n5. **Tiling / mosaic assembly**\n   - The output container is formed by **placing multiple extracted sub-rectangles adjacent** (side-by-side and/or stacked), producing a larger composite rectangle.\n   - Internal patterns (e.g., \u201cnoise\u201d pixels of the border color inside the fill) are preserved as they appear in the fragment.\n\n6. **Border continuity / completion**\n   - The final assembled shape has continuous border lines (color **3** or **7** depending on the example).\n   - Continuity can be achieved either by:\n     - Exact tiling of pieces so borders meet, and/or\n     - Adding/filling missing border segments with the border color (e.g., **7**) when joining sections (explicitly needed in Example 1\u2019s joins).\n\n---\n\n### Example 1: specific transformations (border **7**, fills **0**/**2**)\n1. **Select the main partitioned container (border 7)**\n   - The large **7**-bordered, horizontally partitioned container with top region mostly **0** and bottom region mostly **2** is chosen as the base fragment.\n   - Its internal \u201cnoise\u201d **7** cells are preserved.\n\n2. **Translate the main container**\n   - This base container is shifted to a new position in the output (it appears relocated upward/rightward compared to input).\n\n3. **Attach a top extension fragment (7/0 region)**\n   - A separate **7**-bordered fragment containing **0** (with some **7** noise) is extracted from the upper area of the input and **translated** to become the **top-right extension** of the final container.\n   - It aligns with the base container\u2019s **top border** and the **upper compartment**.\n\n4. **Attach bottom extension fragments (7/2 region)**\n   - A **7/2** fragment from the far right of the input is used as the **bottom-right** portion of the final container (in the example it effectively stays aligned with its original position and becomes an anchor).\n   - Another **7/2** strip-like fragment (from the top-right of the input) is translated to become the **bottom-middle bridge**, matching:\n     - the divider row of **7**,\n     - the first bottom interior row filled with **2**,\n     - and the bottom border of **7**.\n\n5. **Fill/complete join gaps to make one continuous partitioned container**\n   - Where the left base and right/bottom pieces do not touch, the missing cells are set to:\n     - **7** on border/divider rows,\n     - **2** in the bottom interior fill row(s),\n     - (and **0** in top interior if needed),\n   so the final outline and partition line are continuous.\n\n6. **Remove unused objects**\n   - The solid **4** block(s) and any other non-assembled pixels are deleted to **8**.\n\n---\n\n### Example 2: specific transformations (border **3**, fill **9**)\n1. **Remove/ignore color 4**\n   - All **4** pixels are treated as extraneous and removed (changed to **8**).\n   - This also effectively \u201ctrims\u201d one corner piece down to its core 3\u00d73 **3/9** fragment.\n\n2. **Extract four 3\u00d73 corner fragments**\n   - Identify four separate **3\u00d73** tiles that contain border **3** and fill **9**.\n   - Each tile represents a different corner, detectable by which two edges are entirely **3**:\n     - top+left edges = top-left corner piece\n     - top+right edges = top-right corner piece\n     - bottom+left edges = bottom-left corner piece\n     - bottom+right edges = bottom-right corner piece\n\n3. **Assemble a 2\u00d72 mosaic**\n   - Place the four 3\u00d73 corner tiles into a **2\u00d72 layout** to form a **6\u00d76** composite container:\n     - (top-left tile) next to (top-right tile)\n     - stacked above (bottom-left tile) next to (bottom-right tile)\n\n4. **Place the assembled 6\u00d76 object onto an 8 background**\n   - The resulting 6\u00d76 structure is positioned within the output grid (in the example it is effectively centered/anchored so that the top-left corner tile aligns with its original location).\n   -
