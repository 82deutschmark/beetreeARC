        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Assembling Pixel Pieces**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to build a program that solves this ARC task. I'm given two example input/output pairs and a test input to work with. I need to figure out the rules of how the input is transformed into the output.\n\nFirst, I examine the provided examples. The input images are like fractured puzzles, with different-colored rectangular sections scattered around a mostly uniform background (which I'm guessing is going to be the \"background color\", like a blank canvas). I notice the colors used, especially the significant blocks of colors like teal/light blue (8) and others (7, 2, 0). Also there's this noise color 4. In the output, it looks like these \"pieces\" are assembled to form a single, clean image, typically a rectangle, with distinct color patterns. I then move to the first example in-depth. After analysing the contents of the image I realize that the target image has a block of pixels with border (7) and the inner contents (0, 2). The width, the height and even the contents, are all perfectly assembled from the input pieces. The size is also a combination of the different scattered pieces.\n\nBy carefully tracing the patterns within those fragments, I identify rectangular blocks, their colors, their shapes, and where they appear in the output. There are also this noisy color that I should probably get rid of. I am making some hypotheses at this point: 1) the pieces have to be removed of the noise color; and 2) pieces of input should be assembled to form the output. I also realized that the background color is preserved in the output and that \"noise\" colors (like 4 in both examples) are discarded. In this particular case, I am hypothesizing that these 4s are \"junk\" pixels or \"connectors\" that should be ignored.\n\nI test this hypothesis on the example, trying to delete all these pixels of color 4. I note that, if the 4s are deleted, I have a more clean set of puzzle pieces. It seems that this deletion is working! Furthermore, I check that the resulting rectangles do match the contents of the target output image. If it works for one case, let's see for the second!\n\nWhen I look at the second example, I confirm my suspicions: a very similar procedure is in place, but with different colors and shapes. I realize, from these examples, I need to remove noise, separate the image in rectangular components, and assemble the correct combination of the separated pieces. Furthermore, I must find what's the border color (the one that stays out) and all the colors that compose the inside.\n\nWhen it comes to arranging the pieces, I now understand I need to maximize the border on the outside of the output image, which in this case is a rectangle, and get the other colors inside. I am able to assemble, with the pieces, an image of 6x6. Furthermore, I apply a rule to the border pieces to be placed on the border of the target image and, as for the previous examples, I am correct.\n\nFinally, I take the information from these two examples and use it to solve the test case. I again go through the process of: background color identification (8), noise color identification (4), rectangular piece extraction. Then, I am going to form the target pattern by arranging the pieces in order to get a new image. After doing a new set of calculations with the data for the new test input, I am going to generate an output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a coherent image from scattered rectangular fragments in the input grid.\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation rules are:\n1.  **Identify the Background and Noise:** The background color is 8. The color 4 appears to be \"noise\" or \"connector\" pixels that should be discarded.\n2.  **Extract Fragments:** Identify all rectangular blocks of non-background, non-noise pixels.\n3.  **Assemble the Image:** Arrange these fragments to form a single, larger rectangle. The correct arrangement creates a continuous border of a specific color (7 in Ex 1, 3 in Ex 2, and 9 in the Test Input) and matches the pixel patterns along the vertical seams where fragments join.\n4.  **Center the Result:** Place the assembled rectangular image in the center of the output grid.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Fragments Identification:**\n    *   **P1 (Left):** 3x7 block found at rows 3-9, cols 0-2.\n        *   Pattern: Left column is solid 9s. Right column is `9,3,9,3,9,3,9`.\n    *   **P2 (Middle-Left):** 4x7 block found at rows 1-7, cols 6-9.\n        *   Pattern: Left column `9,3,9,3,9,3,9` matches P1. Right column `9,9,9,3,3,9,9`.\n    *   **P3 (Top-Right):** 3x4 block found at rows 2-5, cols 15-17.\n        *   Pattern: Top is solid 9s. Right is solid 9s. Bottom row is `3,3,9`.\n    *   **P4+5 (Middle):** 3x7 block found at rows 8-14, cols 13-15.\n        *   Pattern: Left column `9,9,9,3,3,9,9` matches P2. Right column `9,9,3,9,9,3,9`.\n    *   **P6 (Middle-Right):** 3x7 block found at rows 13-19, cols 3-5.\n        *   Pattern: Left column `9,9,3,9,9,3,9` matches P4+5. Right column `9,9,3,3,3,3,9`.\n    *   **PF (Bottom-Right):** 3x4 block found at rows 16-19, cols 11-13.\n        *   Pattern: Top row `3,3,9` matches P3 bottom. Right is solid 9s.\n\n2.  **Assembly:**\n    *   **Left Edge:** P1 (Solid left border).\n    *   **Sequence:** P1 -> P2 -> P4+5 -> P6 -> (P3 + PF).\n    *   **Right Edge:** P3 stacked on top of PF forms a 3x7 column (sharing the overlap row `3,3,9`). This combined column has a solid right border of 9s.\n    *   **Seam Matching:**\n        *   P1 Right matches P2 Left.\n        *   P2 Right matches P4+5 Left.\n        *   P4+5 Right matches P6 Left.\n        *   P6 Right matches (P3+PF) Left.\n\n    **Assembled Image Size:** 16 wide x 7 high.\n    **Border:** Solid 9s on all four sides.\n\n3.  **Placement:**\n    *   Grid size: 20x20.\n    *   Image size: 16x7.\n    *   Row start: `(20 - 7) / 2 = 6` (integer division). Occupies rows 6-12.\n    *   Col start: `(20 - 16) / 2 = 2`. Occupies cols 2-17.\n\n**Constructed Image Content:**\n*   **Row 0:** `9,9,9` (P1) + `9,9,9,9` (P2) + `9,9,9` (P45) + `9,9,9` (P6) + `9,9,9` (P3) -> All 9s.\n*   **Row 1:** `9,3,3` + `3,3,9,9` + `9,9,9` + `9,3,9` + `9,3,9`\n*   **Row 2:** `9,3,9` + `9,3,9,9` + `9,3,3` + `3,3,3` + `3,3,9`\n*   **Row 3:** `9,3,3` + `3,3,3,3` + `3,3,9` + `9,3,3` + `3,3,9`\n*   **Row 4:** `9,3,9` + `9,3,3,3` + `3,3,9` + `9,3,3` + `3,3,9`\n*   **Row 5:** `9,3,3` + `3,3,9,9` + `9,3,3` + `3,3,3` + `3,3,9`\n*   **Row 6:** `9,9,9` + `9,9,9,9` + `9,9,9` + `9,9,9` + `9,9,9` -> All 9s.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**The Quest for the Assembled Image**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm given this ARC task and I need to figure out how to transform these fragmented input examples into a unified output. Seems simple, right? Well, the \"pieces\" are all jumbled up and I've got to find the correct assembly.\n\nI started by looking at the first example. The grid is 12x20 with a teal (8) background. I see these rectangular-ish blobs of colors. And the output is just a big colorful blob in the middle! It's like finding a complete picture from shattered glass. I need to figure out what those pieces are.\n\nI looked at the pixel values, and I decided to focus on non-background colors (so not the 8s, which are basically \"transparent\" ). Okay, so for example one, there are multiple \"fragments\", I named them \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and so on. They have overlaps, and a ton of Yellow pixels. I tried to see if these pieces could somehow be placed on a 2D canvas, using the background as a transparent layer to get the final \"clean\" picture. In that case, the Yellow color are kind of irrelevant, since I did not find any in the final images, or maybe they just are part of other fragments, just noise, distractor.\n\nI realized the output image seemed to be the \"reconstruction\" of the inputs. In Ex 2, again with 8 as background, the fragments are composed of 4,3,9 pixels and they have to be placed to match the clean final result.\n\nThe core idea is to find the \"Frame Color\" of the objects which in both Ex 1 and Ex 2 are a boundary of the fragments. I believe this might be key to solve.\n\nThen, I looked at the test input with multiple colors, and a bunch of 3s and 9s. I decided 9 will be the frame! Then I searched for potential fragments of shapes and I identified seven. I can see pieces. I need to assemble them. I looked at the edges of the pieces to see if they fit.\n\nI see a kind of chain-like assembly. I found what \"looked\" like the main 3 fragments (3, 1, 4), and saw that they must be placed in that order! But then it does not close. In that case I looked again, and there's a piece 2, and then a piece 6, then finally piece 7! It closes with 4 strips. In that case I looked again in the remaining bits, to be sure I have no more pieces. I saw a bit and I knew it could be the \"piece 8\". This closes all the strips and gives me the complete and valid answer. I found one strip (S5) that I missed before. This adds one extra column.\n\nSo now, I need to assemble this all in the correct final shape.\n\nNow, with this assembly in hand, I can construct the final 7x16 grid, I did the math, then I verified it. Then, I verified it again. Everything looks good.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct an image from a set of fragmented, overlapping, or adjacent \"shards\" present in the input grid. The input contains several disjoint blocks of non-background colors (background is 8). The goal is to assemble these blocks into a single coherent rectangular image.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Fragments:** We identify connected regions of non-8 pixels in the input. In the test case, the relevant colors are Maroon (9) and Green (3). Yellow (4) appears to be noise or markers, as in the examples. The frames of the shapes are Maroon (9).\n\n2.  **Analyze Fragments as Strips:** The fragments appear to be vertical strips or parts of strips of the final image. We can deduce their relative positions by matching the pixel patterns on their vertical edges (right edge of one piece must match the left edge of the next).\n\n    *   **Strip 1 (Leftmost):** Found in Rows 3-9, Cols 0-3.\n        *   Pattern: A 3x7 block framed by 9s on the left, top, and bottom.\n        *   Right Edge: `9,3,9,3,9,3,9`.\n\n    *   **Strip 2 (Middle-Left):** Composed of two pieces found in R1-3 C6-9 (Top) and R4-7 C6-9 (Bottom).\n        *   Left Edge: Matches Strip 1's Right Edge (`9,3,9,3,9,3,9`).\n        *   Right Edge: `9,9,9,3,3,9,9`.\n\n    *   **Strip 3 (Middle):** Composed of Piece 2 (R2-3 C15-18) and Piece 6 (R10-14 C13-15).\n        *   Left Edge: Matches Strip 2's Right Edge (`9,9,9,3,3,9,9`).\n        *   Right Edge: `9,9,3,9,9,3,9`.\n\n    *   **Strip 4 (Middle-Right):** Found in R13-19 C3-5.\n        *   Left Edge: Matches Strip 3's Right Edge (`9,9,3,9,9,3,9`).\n        *   Right Edge: `9,9,3,3,3,3,9`.\n\n    *   **Strip 5 (Rightmost):** Composed of Piece 2 (reused for top), Piece 5 (R4-5 C15-17), and Piece 8 (R17-19 C11-13).\n        *   Left Edge: Matches Strip 4's Right Edge (`9,9,3,3,3,3,9`).\n        *   Right Edge: `9,9,9,9,9,9,9` (Solid line of 9s, closing the frame).\n\n3.  **Assembly:**\n    *   **Strip 1 (3 wide)** + **Strip 2 (4 wide)** + **Strip 3 (3 wide)** + **Strip 4 (3 wide)** + **Strip 5 (3 wide)** = **Total Width 16**.\n    *   **Height** is 7 rows.\n\n    We concatenate the content of these strips row by row.\n\n    **Row 0:** All strips have `9`s on top. -> `9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9`\n    **Row 1:** `9,3,3` + `3,3,9,9` + `9,3,9` + `9,3,9` + `9,3,9` -> `9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,3,9`\n    **Row 2:** `9,3,9` + `9,3,9,9` + `9,3,3` + `3,3,3` + `3,3,9` -> `9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9`\n    **Row 3:** `9,3,3` + `3,3,3,3` + `3,3,9` + `9,3,3` + `3,3,9` -> `9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9`\n    **Row 4:** `9,3,9` + `9,3,3,3` + `3,3,9` + `9,3,3` + `3,3,9` -> `9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9`\n    **Row 5:** `9,3,3` + `3,3,9,9` + `9,3,3` + `3,3,3` + `3,3,9` -> `9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9`\n    **Row 6:** All strips have `9`s on bottom. -> `9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9`\n\noutput:\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,3,9\n9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9\n9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9\n9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9\n9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n1. **Background color stays the same**: in both examples the most common color is **8**, and the output is filled with 8 except for one reconstructed object.\n\n2. **Some colors are \u201cdiscarded\u201d**: color **4** appears in inputs but never appears in outputs, so it is treated as junk and removed (turned into background).\n\n3. **The remaining colored cells form rectangular fragments** (tiles/strips).  \n   These fragments are reassembled into one larger rectangle by:\n   - **stacking fragments vertically** when they have the same width and the touching **edge rows are identical**, and\n   - **joining fragments horizontally** when they have the same height and the touching **edge columns are identical**.\n\n4. **Placement rule**: the reconstructed rectangle is placed so that there are exactly **2 rows of background below it and 2 columns of background to its right** (bottom-right anchored with a 2-cell margin).  \n   This matches both solved examples.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n1. **Set all 4s to 8** (discard junk color).\n2. Find connected components of the remaining colors (3 and 9) and take their bounding rectangles as pieces.\n3. One right-side piece is formed by **stacking** the only 4\u00d73 fragment on top of the 3\u00d73 fragment (their touching rows match).\n4. The resulting five height-7 strips are then ordered by matching the **right edge column of one** to the **left edge column of the next**, producing a single **7\u00d716** rectangle.\n5. Place this 7\u00d716 rectangle into the 20\u00d720 output grid with a **2-cell margin on the bottom and right**, i.e. top-left at row `20-2-7=11`, col `20-2-16=2`.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n1. **Background** is the most common color (here it\u2019s `8`). The output keeps the same grid size and uses the background everywhere except for one reconstructed object.\n\n2. There is a **rare \u201cmarker\u201d color** (`4` in both examples and in this test).  \n   It appears as an **L-shape occupying 3 cells of a 2\u00d72 block**.  \n   The **missing cell** of that 2\u00d72 block is **not marker color**; it belongs to the final object and tells you:\n   - the **frame color** (the color in that missing cell), and\n   - **which corner** of the final assembled object must be placed there (the marker sits \u201coutside\u201d that corner).\n\n   In the test, the marker `4` occupies `(row2,col18) (row2,col19) (row3,col19)`, so the missing cell is `(row3,col18)`.  \n   The marker is **above/right** of the missing cell, so the missing cell is the **top-right corner** of the final object.  \n   The color there is `9`, so **frame/border color = 9**.\n\n3. The remaining colored pixels (`9` and `3`) form several **tile-like blocks**. In this test, the usable pieces are **7\u00d73 tiles** (they have `9` across the whole top and bottom rows).  \n   One piece at the anchored corner is incomplete (only its top 4 rows are present), and there is a matching **3\u00d73** piece elsewhere that completes it to height 7.\n\n4. The tiles are assembled by **matching the vertical edge patterns** like a jigsaw:\n   - right edge of a tile must equal left edge of the next.\n   This produces a **single horizontal strip** of 5 tiles \u2192 size **7\u00d715**.\n\n5. Finally, place that 7\u00d715 strip into an all-`8` grid so that its **top-right corner lands on the anchor cell** `(row3,col18)`.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",
