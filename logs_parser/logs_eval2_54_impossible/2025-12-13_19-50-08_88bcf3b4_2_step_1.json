        "Full raw LLM response": "**Algorithm & Analysis for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task, and it seems I need to figure out a transformation rule applied to a grid, given five examples and a test input. Here's my thought process as I'm going through this:\n\nInitially, I'm just diving in, looking for any patterns. Example 1 has a black background with a yellow 2x2 shape that's incomplete, a vertical azure line, and a single red \"2\". The output seems like the yellow and red elements have moved, but I'm not sure yet in what order. I'm noting down the coordinates to try to figure out a transformation. The main observation here is the presence of a \"static\" element (the vertical line of 8s).\n\nI'm starting to think about gravity or some kind of force that's affecting the other elements, but a simple gravity interpretation doesn't seem to fit at first.\n\nExample 2 brings a new set of shapes and colors.  Here, I'm focusing on the green vertical line, which also seems like a static element. The 3s are the mobile objects in this example, and they move to adjacent the wall of 4s.  I notice this and that there might be an attraction or repelling force.\n\nHypothesis 1: Objects move until they hit an obstacle or another object. I'm starting to think about objects moving and being blocked by other objects. I'm still trying to put the pieces together.\n\nAt this point, I'm looking for the key players in each example. It seems a central concept is a \"fixed\" object (like the vertical lines), and other \"mobile\" objects move relative to that.\n\nThe examples 3, 4, and 5 show other colors. Example 4 has a wall of gray 5s, with a bunch of 8s and 3s on the left. The 8s and 3s move upwards and towards the wall. Example 5 has 6s, 9s, and 3s, demonstrating further this relationship of vertical and diagonal motion to the wall.\n\nThis all leads me to develop a \"Unifited Theory\":\n\n**Unified Theory:**  There are \"fixed\" and \"mobile\" elements. Fixed elements are usually vertical lines of a consistent color. Mobile elements move towards a fixed element, and upwards.\n\nMy observations lead me to think I can refine this into the following rules:\n\n1.  Identify \"walls\" (vertical segments).\n2.  Identify \"mobile pixels\" (everything else).\n3.  Movement: Horizontal movement is towards the nearest wall, and there's a downward, or possibly upward force.\n4.  Stacking: Mobile pixels are attracted to the wall, or stack. There seems to be \"Upward Gravity\" where they try to get to the highest row index.\n   -  In the simple case, pixels are moved directly to adjacent to the wall, and moved in vertical order. This is a form of  \"bubble\" algorithm.\n   -   Another thought is that they are \"shadows\", where shapes are projected on to diagonals. This does not seem to fit the pattern.\n5.  There's no particular need to move them to a new angle. \n   - There's horizontal attraction to the wall and some vertical \"gravity\" up the wall.\n\nThe \"Test Input\" has a bunch of elements, so I'm applying what I've learned: a green vertical line, and other blue, magenta, yellow, and red shapes scattered around it, and I will try to map the new positions by the current set of rules.\n\nTo be sure, I will double check my code, and apply to all 5 examples and the test case to be sure it matches the transformation.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of integers (colors) based on a pattern inferred from examples.\n\n**Inferred Rules:**\n1.  **Identify \"Fixed\" and \"Mobile\" objects.**\n    *   **Fixed Objects (\"Walls\"):** Vertical line segments of a uniform color. These act as anchors or barriers.\n        *   Example 1: The vertical line of 8s.\n        *   Example 2: The vertical lines of 4s and 2s.\n        *   Example 4: The vertical line of 5s.\n        *   Test Input:\n            *   Group 1: Vertical line of 3s (Green) at Column 13, Rows 0-5.\n            *   Group 2: Vertical line of 1s (Blue) at Column 6, Rows 22-26.\n            *   Group 3: Vertical line of 5s (Gray) at Column 22, Rows 16-18 (approx).\n    *   **Mobile Objects:** Clusters of pixels of a different color located to the left (or sometimes right) of a Wall.\n        *   Test Input Group 1: 1s (Blue) to the left of the 3s wall.\n        *   Test Input Group 2: 4s (Yellow) to the left of the 1s wall.\n        *   Test Input Group 3: 6s (Magenta) to the left of the 5s wall.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule (Gravity/Magnetism):**\n    *   **Horizontal Movement:** Mobile pixels move horizontally towards their respective Wall until they are adjacent to it (or adjacent to other mobile pixels already packed against the wall). In all Test Input cases, the mobile objects are to the Left, so they move **Right**.\n    *   **Vertical Movement (\"Floating\"):** Mobile pixels move **Upwards** as far as possible. They stop if they reach the top of the grid, the top of the Wall's vertical range, or are blocked by other pixels.\n        *   Specifically, the mobile cluster aligns its top row with the top row of the Wall (or row 0 if the wall starts at 0).\n    *   **Compaction:** The relative shape of the mobile cluster is preserved per row (horizontal compaction), and the rows stack up directly from the top.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Group 1 (Top Center):**\n    *   **Wall:** 3s at `(0,13)` to `(5,13)`. Top is Row 0.\n    *   **Mobile:** 1s (Blue).\n        *   Input Rows: 2, 3, 4, 5.\n        *   Shape:\n            *   Row 2: 1, 1, 1 (Cols 7-9)\n            *   Row 3: 1 (Col 9)\n            *   Row 4: 1, 1, 1 (Cols 9-11)\n            *   Row 5: 1 (Col 12)\n    *   **Action:** Move Up to align with Row 0. Move Right to compact against Col 13.\n    *   **New Positions:**\n        *   Row 2 1s -> Move to Row 0. Compact to Cols 10, 11, 12. -> `(0,10), (0,11), (0,12)`\n        *   Row 3 1 -> Move to Row 1. Compact to Col 12. -> `(1,12)`\n        *   Row 4 1s -> Move to Row 2. Compact to Cols 10, 11, 12. -> `(2,10), (2,11), (2,12)`\n        *   Row 5 1 -> Move to Row 3. Compact to Col 12. -> `(3,12)`\n\n*   **Group 2 (Bottom Left):**\n    *   **Wall:** 1s at `(22,6)` to `(26,6)`. Top is Row 22.\n    *   **Mobile:** 4s (Yellow).\n        *   Input Rows: 22, 23, 24. (Already aligned with top of wall).\n        *   Shape:\n            *   Row 22: 4, 4 (Cols 4-5) -> Already touching wall.\n            *   Row 23: 4, 4, 4 (Cols 2-4)\n            *   Row 24: 4, 4 (Cols 2-3)\n    *   **Action:** Move Right to compact against Col 6.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Comprehensive Analysis and Solution for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task with several examples. My job is to figure out the rule. I start by breaking down each example, looking for patterns. The user wants me to be an expert in this field so I have to be precise and detailed.\n\n**Example 1** I start with this example. I notice different colored shapes moving around. I think about \u201cgravity\u201d and \u201cprojection,\u201d like objects moving until they hit something. I\u2019m thinking, maybe there is a stationary \"wall\". Objects seem to be moving towards the wall. The direction might be right or up or a combination. The \u201c4\u201ds are the ones I\u2019m most interested in, they look like they move. The \u201c2\u201d and \u201c8\u201d seem to be static.\n\nI see that the \u201c4\u201ds form a line to the left of 8. In output the 4s are adjacent to 8 and 2. It looks like the \u201c4\u201ds are \u201cfalling\u201d.\n\nThen I look at the color count. I see it has to do with moving and stationary items.\n\nI consider the shapes of the moving parts and the stationary pieces. The 4s move toward the wall, I am thinking.\n\n**Example 2** is next. Here orange background, 4, 3, 2 are present. I focus on \u201c3\u201d. It seems to move up toward the \u201c4\u201d.\n\n**Example 3** shows 7s and 9s moving toward 2. Again, this points to a direction towards a wall.\n\nI am concluding that there's a stationary object that creates a wall, and other objects move toward this object until they collide and stop.\n\n**Example 4** 3s and 8s are moving up toward 5. The direction is the key.\n\nI look at **Example 5** in the same way. The \u201c8\u201ds form the background. And the items moving again. I am sure it is a moving object and stationary object problem.\n\nI go back to thinking about direction, what determines direction?\n\nI go through each example again and try to establish the direction of the moving parts and relate this direction to the static parts.\n\nAfter analyzing examples, I form a hypothesis: \u201cGravity\u201d towards a static wall or edge or the closest static item. Or it is the adjacent stationary item.\nThe slide direction is vertical. Up or down? Depends on index direction. Low to Top. So \"Slide up\".\n\nI see that static objects are horizontal or vertical.\n\nI look at the Test input. I will check for the stationary objects here. I am looking for lines. There are lines! I see them.\n\nI am figuring out the key components. I am looking at \u201csource\u201d and \u201cdestination.\u201d Then I will look for other shapes to fit.\n- \"1\" moves to \"3\" - \"gravity\".\n- \u201c5\u201d moves to \u201c2\u201d - gravity.\n- \u201c4\u201d moves to \u201c1\u201d.\n- \u201c6\u201d moves to \u201c5\u201d.\n\nThe whole grid is a puzzle and there are four puzzles here.\n\nI look for the shape of objects. I look at gravity. The shapes have to go to the destinations. So I need to fit the parts.\nI look at the colors.\n\nI reevaluate - It is a moving object and a static object.\nThe 5s move up to form the shape near 2.\n\nI am looking to make the grid by placing the correct moving objects.\n\nI see that blue \"1\" moves toward Green \"3\".\nThen 6 and 5? 6 moves.\nThen 4 moves to 1.\nSo each puzzle has a wall and object.\n\nI need the dimensions.\nI am double checking the objects.\nI am rechecking everything. I have done the grid. I think I am good.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Inferred Logic:**\nThe puzzle involves **moving objects** (clouds of colored pixels) towards **static wall objects** (lines of a different color).\n- **Static Objects**: Identified as straight vertical or horizontal lines. In the Test Input, these are:\n    - Green '3' (Vertical, Rows 0-5, Col 13).\n    - Maroon '9' (Vertical, Rows 7-9, Col 13).\n    - Red '2' (Horizontal, Row 14, Cols 21-26).\n    - Blue '1' (Vertical, Rows 22-26, Col 6).\n- **Moving Objects**: Irregular shapes of other colors. They move in the cardinal direction perpendicular to the wall they are facing until they collide.\n- **Physics**: When the moving pixels hit the wall (or the column/row adjacent to it), they stack up. The stacking behavior minimizes the index along the wall (Slide UP for vertical walls, Slide LEFT for horizontal walls). They fill the adjacent layer first, then the next layer out.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nWe identify 5 distinct moving groups and map them to their target walls:\n\n1.  **Blue '1's** (Top-Left):\n    -   **Source**: Rows 2-5, Cols 7-12. Total 8 pixels.\n    -   **Target**: Green '3' Wall (Rows 0-5, Col 13).\n    -   **Action**: Move RIGHT. Slide UP.\n    -   **Placement**: Fill Column 12 (adjacent to wall) from Row 0 downwards.\n        -   Col 12: Rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (6 pixels).\n        -   Col 11: Rows 0, 1 (2 pixels).\n\n2.  **Gray '5's** (Left):\n    -   **Source**: Rows 19-20, Cols 4-6. Total 6 pixels.\n    -   **Target**: Maroon '9' Wall (Rows 7-9, Col 13).\n    -   **Action**: Move RIGHT. Slide UP.\n    -   **Placement**: Fill Column 12 (adjacent to wall) starting at the top of the wall (Row 7).\n        -   Col 12: Rows 7, 8, 9 (3 pixels).\n        -   Col 11: Rows 7, 8, 9 (3 pixels).\n\n3.  **Magenta '6's** (Middle-Right):\n    -   **Source**: Rows 16-17, Cols 16-18. Total 4 pixels.\n    -   **Target**: Maroon '9' Wall (Rows 7-9, Col 13).\n    -   **Action**: Move LEFT. Slide UP.\n    -   **Placement**: Fill Column 14 (adjacent to wall on the right) starting at the top of the wall (Row 7).\n        -   Col 14: Rows 7, 8, 9 (3 pixels).\n        -   Col 15: Row 7 (1 pixel).\n\n4.  **Gray '5's** (Right):\n    -   **Source**: Rows 15-19, Cols 21-24. Total 7 pixels.\n    -   **Target**: Red '2' Wall (Row 14, Cols 21-26).\n    -   **Action**: Move UP.

The scattered shape gets transformed to form a line or symmetric pattern connecting the anchor elements\n3. The transformation often involves straightening scattered shapes or reflecting them around an intersection point\n\nFor the test input, I identify three groups:\n\n**Top Group (rows 0-12):**\n- 3 line at column 13 (rows 0-5) - anchor\n- 9 line at column 13 (rows 7-9) - anchor  \n- 1s scattered (rows 2-5, cols 7-12) - to be transformed\n\nThe 1s should form a diagonal path from the 3 line through the gap to the 9 line, then alongside and reflect back - similar to Example 3.\n\n**Bottom-left Group:**\n- 5 block at rows 19-20, cols 4-6 - anchor\n- 1 line at column 6 (rows 22-26) - anchor\n- 4s scattered (rows 22-24, cols 2-5) - to be transformed into a \"V\" shape connecting them\n\n**Bottom-right Group:**\n- 2 horizontal line at row 14 (cols 21-26) - anchor\n- 5s scattered forming diagonal - transformed to vertical line at col 21\n- 6s small diagonal - stays unchanged (like the 3s in Example 4)\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,4,8,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nEach puzzle contains (at least) three non-background objects:\n\n1. **A \u201csource\u201d line** (a straight segment) of some color **S**.\n2. **A \u201cmoving\u201d object** of some color **M** that touches the source line at exactly one place (the \u201chead\u201d).\n3. **A \u201ctarget\u201d object** of some color **T** somewhere else.\n\nThe output keeps the **source** and **target** unchanged, but **rebuilds** the moving object into a single 1-cell-thick path.\n\n#### Steps\n\n1. **Background** is the most frequent color.\n2. **Find the moving head**: the unique cell of color **M** that is 4-neighbor adjacent to the source line **S**.\n3. **Compute the moving length `L`**:  \n   Treat the cells of color **M** as an 8-neighbor graph.  \n   `L = (maximum shortest-path distance from the head to any M-cell) + 1`.  \n   (This matches why some examples \u201close\u201d extra pixels: only the longest reachable chain length matters.)\n4. **Compute the offset direction `d`**: the unit step from the adjacent source cell into the head (e.g. left, right, up, down).\n5. **Find the target border facing direction `d`**:  \n   Take all target cells that have **no target cell one step in direction `d`**. (This is the exposed edge of the target in that direction.)\n6. **Shift that border by `d`** to make a \u201cshadow path\u201d **B\u2032** (this is where the moving color will run, staying 1 cell away from the target).\n7. **Build the new M path of length `L`**:\n   - Start at the head.\n   - Walk toward the appropriate endpoint of **B\u2032** (top/bottom if source is vertical, left/right if source is horizontal) using 8-neighbor steps.\n   - Then follow along **B\u2032**.\n   - If cells remain after consuming **B\u2032**, continue in the \u201creflected\u201d diagonal direction (same parallel component, opposite perpendicular component; if the approach was purely vertical/horizontal, the missing perpendicular sign comes from `d`).\n8. **Erase the original M pixels** (set them to background), then draw the new path.\n\n#### Applying to the test grid\nThere are three independent instances:\n- `S=3` (vertical), `M=1`, `T=9` (vertical) near the top.\n- `S=2` (horizontal), `M=5`, `T=6` near the middle-right.\n- `S=1` (vertical), `M=4`, `T=5` (a block; we use its left exposed edge) near the bottom-left.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,6,6,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

For the **wire-color connected component** that is touching one anchor:\n   - Let **start** be the wire pixel that is **adjacent** (4-neighbor) to that anchor (if several, use the one closest to the other anchor).\n   - Consider all **empty (background) cells adjacent (4-neighbor)** to the *other* anchor as possible endpoints.\n   - Choose the endpoint that makes the shortest 8-connected path from start **as long as possible but not longer than the number of pixels in the original wire component**.\n   - Draw that **shortest 8-connected path** through background cells (other non-background colors act as obstacles).\n   - If the path uses fewer cells than the wire component size, **extend one step at a time in the direction of the last move** (while staying in-bounds and on background) until you\u2019ve used as many wire pixels as available.\n3. **Erase the original wire component** (set its old cells back to background), keeping only the newly drawn path.\n\nIn the test grid this pattern appears three times (three separate \u201cwire + two anchors\u201d groups), so we apply the same procedure to each group independently.\n\n---\n\n### Applying it to the test input\n\nBackground color is **8**.\n\nWe find three wire-components that touch an anchor and have a clear \u201cother anchor\u201d nearby:\n\n1) **Top group:** anchors **3** (vertical) and **9** (vertical), wire color **1**  \n- Wire component size = 8, start at the `1` touching the `3` column.\n- Connect toward the `9` column using the longest allowed shortest path, then extend to use all 8.\n\n2) **Middle-right group:** anchors **2** (horizontal) and **6** (small block), wire color **5**  \n- The right-side 5-component size = 7, start at the `5` touching the `2` line.\n- Choose an endpoint adjacent to the `6` block giving a 7-cell shortest path (no extension needed).\n\n3) **Bottom-left group:** anchors **1** (vertical) and **5** (left block), wire color **4**  \n- Wire component size = 6, start at the `4` touching the bottom `1` column.\n- Draw the best (longest allowed) shortest path to a cell adjacent to the left `5` block, then extend one step to use all 6.\n\nAll other colors/objects remain unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",
