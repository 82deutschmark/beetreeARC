I'm focusing on identifying recurring patterns and formulating rules that can be applied to the test input.**\n\nFirst, I meticulously analyze the provided examples, noticing the grid size, background color, and the presence of enclosed areas defined by a distinct wall color. It appears that the key is understanding how the colors inside these enclosed areas, relative to the walls, are transformed.\n\nI delve into the detailed structure of a single example, tracing the boundaries formed by the wall color and mapping the pixel values inside. I see there are colored pixels within these 'rooms' at specific positions (like corners), and the corresponding output seems to form a 2x2 block of that color at the outer corner of the room.\n\nMy initial hypothesis: inside pixels act as triggers, with their position relative to the room\u2019s corners determining the location of the 2x2 output block. I test this, carefully verifying the input and output, correlating the inner colored pixels with the produced external blocks.\n\nI then move to generalize these patterns. The process of discovering the room corners and the positions of the inner color markers is where my pattern recognition comes to bear. I recognize that a TL (Top-Left), TR (Top-Right), BL (Bottom-Left), or BR (Bottom-Right) marker means to place a 2x2 block with the marker's color at the respective outer wall corner. The positions of these markers are usually just one unit within the room's boundary.\n\nNext, I need to define what exactly constitutes a \u2018room\u2019 in the general case, looking for any loops formed by the wall color. In the test input, background colors also change, and I deduce that the wall consists of any contiguous non-background pixels. I work to apply the same corner-marking and 2x2 output rules, carefully examining the relationship between each corner and the markers within the corresponding enclosed areas.\n\nI'm starting to get comfortable with the idea that these rules apply even if the wall borders are broken or multi-colored, and that these 2x2 blocks overwrite whatever is present, including the walls, and that pre-existing corner pixels, or hints, can be ignored.\n\nI am prepared to test with the actual test input. I use all my observations to find the 'rooms', identify their markers and generate the final output grid, which I'll build according to these rules: creating the corner blocks with the right colors in the right positions, and keeping the rest of the original input.\n\nThe task requires identifying rectangular regions (\"rooms\") bounded by walls (typically color 0, but sometimes mixed). Inside each room, there are marker pixels located diagonally adjacent to the inner corners (e.g., at `(r_min+1, c_min+1)` for the top-left). For each marker found, a 2x2 block of the marker's color is generated at the corresponding exterior corner of the wall. The 2x2 block is centered on the wall's corner pixel (covering the wall corner, the diagonal exterior, and the two adjacent exterior pixels). The transformation overwrites any existing pixels in that 2x2 area.\n\n**Analysis of the Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Room 1 (Top-Left)**\n    *   **Bounds:** Rows 2-7, Columns 2-7.

(Defined by outer loop of 0s, with corner idiosyncrasies).\n    *   **Top-Left (TL) Corner:** Wall corner effectively at (5,13). Inside TL is (6,14).\n        *   Input at (6,14) is **2**. (Note: Wall corner at (5,13) is also 2 in input).\n        *   **Action:** Create 2x2 block of 2s at (4,12) to (5,13).\n    *   **Top-Right (TR) Corner:** Wall at (5,20).

<EXPLANATION>\n**My approach to this ARC task is multifaceted, leveraging a deep understanding of the solved examples to generalize a solution. I'm focusing on identifying recurring patterns and formulating rules that can be applied to the test input.**\n\nFirst, I meticulously analyze the provided examples, noticing the grid size, background color, and the presence of enclosed areas defined by a distinct wall color. It appears that the key is understanding how the colors inside these enclosed areas, relative to the walls, are transformed.\n\nI delve into the detailed structure of a single example, tracing the boundaries formed by the wall color and mapping the pixel values inside. I see there are colored pixels within these 'rooms' at specific positions (like corners), and the corresponding output seems to form a 2x2 block of that color at the outer corner of the room.\n\nMy initial hypothesis: inside pixels act as triggers, with their position relative to the room\u2019s corners determining the location of the 2x2 output block. I test this, carefully verifying the input and output, correlating the inner colored pixels with the produced external blocks.\n\nI then move to generalize these patterns. The process of discovering the room corners and the positions of the inner color markers is where my pattern recognition comes to bear. I recognize that a TL (Top-Left), TR (Top-Right), BL (Bottom-Left), or BR (Bottom-Right) marker means to place a 2x2 block with the marker's color at the respective outer wall corner. The positions of these markers are usually just one unit within the room's boundary.\n\nNext, I need to define what exactly constitutes a \u2018room\u2019 in the general case, looking for any loops formed by the wall color. In the test input, background colors also change, and I deduce that the wall consists of any contiguous non-background pixels. I work to apply the same corner-marking and 2x2 output rules, carefully examining the relationship between each corner and the markers within the corresponding enclosed areas.\n\nI'm starting to get comfortable with the idea that these rules apply even if the wall borders are broken or multi-colored, and that these 2x2 blocks overwrite whatever is present, including the walls, and that pre-existing corner pixels, or hints, can be ignored.\n\nI am prepared to test with the actual test input. I use all my observations to find the 'rooms', identify their markers and generate the final output grid, which I'll build according to these rules: creating the corner blocks with the right colors in the right positions, and keeping the rest of the original input.\n\nThe task requires identifying rectangular regions (\"rooms\") bounded by walls (typically color 0, but sometimes mixed). Inside each room, there are marker pixels located diagonally adjacent to the inner corners (e.g., at `(r_min+1, c_min+1)` for the top-left). For each marker found, a 2x2 block of the marker's color is generated at the corresponding exterior corner of the wall. The 2x2 block is centered on the wall's corner pixel (covering the wall corner, the diagonal exterior, and the two adjacent exterior pixels). The transformation overwrites any existing pixels in that 2x2 area.\n\n**Analysis of the Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Room 1 (Top-Left)**\n    *   **Bounds:** Rows 2-7, Columns 2-7. (Walls are primarily 0s).\n    *   **Top-Left (TL) Corner:** Wall at (2,2). Inside TL is (3,3).\n        *   Input at (3,3) is **4**.\n        *   **Action:** Create 2x2 block of 4s at (1,1) to (2,2).\n    *   **Top-Right (TR) Corner:** Wall at (2,7). Inside TR is (3,6).\n        *   Input at (3,6) is 3 (Background). No marker.\n    *   **Bottom-Left (BL) Corner:** Wall at (7,2). Inside BL is (6,3).\n        *   Input at (6,3) is 3 (Background). No marker.\n    *   **Bottom-Right (BR) Corner:** Wall at (7,7). Inside BR is (6,6).\n        *   Input at (6,6) is **1**.\n        *   **Action:** Create 2x2 block of 1s at (7,7) to (8,8).\n\n2.  **Room 2 (Right Side)**\n    *   **Bounds:** Rows 5-12, Columns 13-20. (Defined by outer loop of 0s, with corner idiosyncrasies).\n    *   **Top-Left (TL) Corner:** Wall corner effectively at (5,13). Inside TL is (6,14).\n        *   Input at (6,14) is **2**. (Note: Wall corner at (5,13) is also 2 in input).\n        *   **Action:** Create 2x2 block of 2s at (4,12) to (5,13).\n    *   **Top-Right (TR) Corner:** Wall at (5,20). Inside TR is (6,19).\n        *   Input at (6,19) is **6**.\n        *   **Action:** Create 2x2 block of 6s at (4,20) to (5,21).\n    *   **Bottom-Left (BL) Corner:** Wall at (12,13). Inside BL is (11,14).\n        *   Input at (11,14) is 3 (Background). No marker.\n    *   **Bottom-Right (BR) Corner:** Wall at (12,20).

At certain places these 0-walls form a **90\u00b0 corner** (an L-shape). Near the *inside* of such corners there is sometimes a **marker color** (a non-background, non-0 color). The output \u201cdecorates\u201d each corner using that marker color.\n\nFor each 0-cell that is a **corner** (it has exactly **two orthogonal 0-neighbors** that are perpendicular, e.g. left+down, right+down, left+up, right+up):\n\n1. **Determine the interior diagonal direction** of the corner (the diagonal that points between the two 0-neighbors into the open area).\n   - If the corner\u2019s 0-neighbors are **right & down**, interior diagonal is **down-right**.\n   - **left & down** \u21d2 **down-left**\n   - **left & up** \u21d2 **up-left**\n   - **right & up** \u21d2 **up-right**\n\n2. **Look along that interior diagonal** starting from the diagonal neighbor cell and moving outward until finding the first cell whose color is:\n   - not 0, and\n   - not the global background color  \n   This color is the **marker color** for that corner.  \n   If no such marker exists, do nothing for that corner.\n\n3. **Paint the diagonal segment** from the corner to the marker (inclusive) with the marker color.\n\n4. **Also paint the two \u201coutside\u201d orthogonal neighbors** of the corner (the directions opposite the two 0-neighbors) with the marker color (when in bounds).  \n   Example: for a corner with 0-neighbors right&down, the outside neighbors are up and left.\n\n(When the marker is farther than 1 step away, this produces the thicker corner patterns seen in the examples; in the test case all found markers are 1 step away, so only the corner plus its two outside neighbors change, and the marker itself stays.)\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\nCorners with a valid marker on the interior diagonal:\n\n- Top-left 0-frame corner at **(2,2)** has marker **4** at (3,3) \u21d2 paint corner and outside up/left.\n- Bottom-right corner of that same frame at **(7,7)** has marker **1** at (6,6) \u21d2 paint corner and outside down/right.\n- Corner at **(5,20)** has marker **6** at (6,19) \u21d2 paint corner and outside up/right.\n- Corner at **(12,20)** has marker **8** at (11,19) \u21d2 paint corner and outside down/right.\n- L-corner at **(14,6)** has marker **5** at (15,5) \u21d2 paint corner and outside up/right.\n\nAll other 0-corners have no valid marker along their interior diagonal, so they remain unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,0,4,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,0,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,3\n3,3,0,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n3,3,0,3,3,3,1,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,3,3,3,6,0,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,3,3,3,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,8,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,0,4,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,0,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,3\n      3,3,0,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n      3,3,0,3,3,3,1,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,3,3,3,6,0,3\n      3,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,3,3,3,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,0,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,8,0,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_3_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Observations from the solved examples\n\n1. **One color dominates the grid** (the \u201cbackground\u201d).\n2.

The examples show two corner-stamping modes; the mode is chosen by whether **any 0 touches the outer border of the whole grid**:\n   - **If no 0 touches the grid border** (Example 2): keep the corner 0 and color the surrounding 6 cells (the 2\u00d72 inside block minus the corner, plus the 2\u00d72 outside block minus the corner).\n   - **If at least one 0 touches the grid border** (Examples 1 & 3; also true for this test):  \n     - Color the **corner cell** and its **two outside orthogonal neighbors** with the corner color (a 3-cell \u201cL\u201d outside).  \n     - If the marker was **more than 1 step away** along the inward diagonal, also:\n       - color the **diagonal-outside** cell (making a full outside 2\u00d72), and\n       - color any **background** cells along the inward diagonal between the corner and the marker (diagonal \u201cbridge\u201d).\n\nIn the test input, there are 0s on the outer border (row 15 starts with 0s), so we use the **second mode**.\n\n### Output grid\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,0,4,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,0,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,3\n3,3,0,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n3,3,0,3,3,3,1,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,3,3,3,6,0,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,3,3,3,0,2,3,3,3,6,3,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,6,3,3,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,6,3,3,3,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,6,3,3,3,3,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,6,3,3,3,3,8,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,0,4,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,0,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,3\n      3,3,0,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n      3,3,0,3,3,3,1,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,2,3,3,3,6,0,3\n      3,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,3,3,3,0,2,3,3,3,6,3,0,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,6,3,3,0,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,6,3,3,3,0,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,6,3,3,3,3,0,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,6,3,3,3,3,8,0,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,5,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- SELECT THE BEST RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1. It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3.

Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
