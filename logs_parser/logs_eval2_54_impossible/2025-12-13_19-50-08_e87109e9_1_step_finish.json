model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_1_step_1\">\n### Inferred transformation\n\nThe input is split into two parts:\n\n1) **Instruction panel (top 6 rows)**  \nIt consists of **four 6\u00d76 compartments** (because the grid is 24 columns wide \u2192 4 blocks of 6 columns).  \nInside each compartment, there is a **single vertical strip** of some color (not 0 or 5). Its position gives a turn rule for that color:\n\n- strip on the **left interior column** \u2192 that color means **TURN LEFT**\n- strip on the **right interior column** \u2192 that color means **TURN RIGHT**\n\n(0 and 5 are just framing/background for the instruction panel.)\n\n2) **Board (everything below the all-5 row)**  \nThis is the part we output (same size as the board), after modifying it.\n\nOn the board there is a rectangular **seed block of color 8**. Let its size be **H\u00d7W** (here it\u2019s 3\u00d73). Think of it as a moving \u201ccar\u201d of that exact size.\n\n**Movement simulation**\n- Launch **four copies** of this 8-block from the seed position, with initial directions: **up, down, left, right**.\n- The block moves one cell at a time. It may pass through background cells (the dominant board color; here it\u2019s 9) and through already-8 cells.\n- It **cannot overlap any other color** (these act as walls).\n- As it moves, every background cell covered by the block is recolored to **8** (leaving wall colors unchanged).\n- When it cannot advance because the next step would overlap a wall, it **turns 90\u00b0** according to that wall\u2019s color rule from the instruction panel, then continues.\n- When it cannot advance because the next step would go out of bounds, that moving copy **stops**.\n\nThe final output is the board with the union of all painted trails.\n\n### Applying to the test\nFrom the instruction panel:\n- color **1**: left interior \u2192 **turn left**\n- color **3**: right interior \u2192 **turn right**\n- color **2**: left interior \u2192 **turn left**\n- color **4**: left interior \u2192 **turn left**\n\nOn the board, the seed is a **3\u00d73** block of 8, so the moving block is 3\u00d73.

We discard them and only transform the remaining grid.\n\n### 1) Decode the legend (turn rules)\nThe legend contains 4 small panels across the width. In each panel, one color forms a vertical bar either on the **left** side of the panel\u2019s interior or on the **right** side:\n\n- bar on the **left**  \u2192 that color makes the path **turn left**\n- bar on the **right** \u2192 that color makes the path **turn right**\n\nFrom the test legend:\n- color **1**: left-turn\n- color **3**: right-turn\n- color **2**: left-turn\n- color **4**: left-turn\n\n### 2) Find the starting block and thickness\nIn the main grid (after removing the legend), the only 8s form a solid **3\u00d73** block.  \nThat block is the start, and its size (**k = 3**) is the \u201cthickness\u201d of the moving path.\n\n### 3) Trace thick beams that bounce\nTreat color **9** as empty space to paint on (it\u2019s the dominant background and not listed in the legend). Colors 1/2/3/4 are obstacles; when the moving 8-strip would enter them, it **stops just before** and **turns** according to the legend rule for that color, then continues.\n\nWe emit 4 beams of thickness 3 from the 3\u00d73 seed: **north, south, west, east**.  \nWhenever a beam hits a turn-color, it turns 90\u00b0 and continues, keeping thickness 3 by using the last 3 rows/columns at the impact edge.\n\nIn this test, these bounces produce:\n- a vertical strip at cols 9\u201311 from rows 4\u201317 (stopped by color 2 at the top and color 4 at the bottom),\n- a horizontal strip on rows 4\u20136 reaching the left edge,\n- a wide horizontal strip on rows 8\u201310 from cols 4\u201321,\n- a vertical strip at cols 4\u20136 down to the bottom,\n- a vertical strip at cols 19\u201321 down to the bottom,\n- a horizontal strip on rows 15\u201317 from cols 9\u201324.\n\nOverlaying all of these turns the corresponding 9-cells into 8, leaving 1/2/3/4 unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## Output

legend**, i.e. `input[6:]`.\n\n**2) The legend encodes a turning rule per color.**  \nIn each mini-panel the colored strip is either:\n\n- on the **left edge** of the 4-cell interior \u21d2 that color means **TURN LEFT** (90\u00b0 counterclockwise)\n- on the **right edge** \u21d2 that color means **TURN RIGHT** (90\u00b0 clockwise)\n\n**3) In the main area there is a solid block of color 8; it is the \u201ccrawler\u201d size.**  \nThe main area contains one solid square of color **8**.  \nIts size is the thickness of the path: in the training examples it is 2\u00d72; in the test it is 3\u00d73.\n\n**4) Draw four paths (up, right, down, left) as a sliding k\u00d7k block.**\n\nLet `k` be the side length of the 8-block. For each of the 4 directions, start with a k\u00d7k block at the 8-block position and repeatedly:\n\n- attempt to move the whole k\u00d7k block by 1 cell in the current direction\n- **if the moved block would go out of bounds, stop**\n- **if the moved block would overlap any non-background, non-8 color, stop before the overlap**, read that blocking color, then **turn** left/right according to the legend and continue from the current position\n- paint every cell visited by any of the four crawlers as **8**\n- never overwrite the colored rectangles; only background cells become 8\n\nThis exactly reproduces the \u201croad network\u201d in all three examples.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\nLegend (row 2 of the input) gives:\n\n- color **1** strip on left \u21d2 **turn left**\n- color **3** strip on right \u21d2 **turn right**\n- color **2** strip on left \u21d2 **turn left**\n- color **4** strip on left \u21d2 **turn left**\n\nMain area (after removing 6 legend rows) has a **3\u00d73** block of 8 at rows 8\u201310, cols 9\u201311 (so `k=3`).  \nTracing the four crawlers with those turn rules produces the following output grid.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid (24\u00d724)\n\n```text\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_F>\n</CANDIDATE 3>\n<CANDIDATE 9>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 24x24\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n222222222222222222222333\n999999998889999999999333\n999999998889999999999333\n999999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111888888888888888888333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999333\n111999998889999999999999\n111999998889999999999999\n111999998889999999999999\n999999998889999999999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999944444444499999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n999999999999999999999999\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n**My current thought process revolves around cracking this ARC puzzle, which involves transforming a grid based on a header section and a body.**  I'm focusing on three examples and a test case, trying to discern the underlying logic. Initially, I'm noting the basic characteristics of the inputs: the gray background in the header, the colored \"sockets\", and how the header is removed to create the output's size. My first observation is that the output seems to be the body with some modifications.\n\nMy intuition is drawn to something like a connecting wiring scheme. Example 1's output shows 8s (teal) that seem to connect the different blocks and the top edge. The header has markers (1, 6, 4, 2) that don't always align perfectly with the block colors. Further, I'm focused on what I'm calling the \"seed\" of 8s, which seems to expand outwards. Through analyzing Example 2, the pattern becomes clearer.\n\nThe blocks must be somehow \"powered\" from the header via a network of wires. Example 2's header has markers 2, 4, 6, and 3. The input body has blocks 2, 3, 4, and 6. The wires, identified by 8s, create vertical and horizontal \"buses\" that connect everything. I'm noting that the existing 8s in the body seem to seed the wiring structure, and the logic here is to expand a wire from the blocks that don't get the Main Vertical wire. There are some nuances with edge blocks in the examples.\n\nMy new hypothesis: the wires are seeded in the blocks with the \"0\" pattern. My attention gets drawn to how blocks are connected together in this wiring setup.\n\nI have a unified view: I'm calling the network formed by the seed and header marks the \"Main Cross.\" From that, I draw vertical or horizontal 8s based on the position and configuration of blocks that need additional power. There are specific rules around where these extra vertical lines are drawn, and those seem to be dependent on whether the Header Marker is \"inside\" or \"outside\" the block columns. I'm starting to think this is robust.\n\nI've got the final formula. I'll test it on the input test to make sure, using the formula, and verify the outcome.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I first analyzed the structure of the input and output grids across the provided examples.\n\n**Observations:**\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input consists of a \"Header\" (top 6 rows, background color 5) and a \"Body\" (remaining rows, variable background color).\n    *   The **Header** contains \"sockets\" (patterns of black `0`s) and colored \"markers\" (single pixels like `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `6`). These markers seem to correspond to the colors of rectangular blocks found in the Body.\n    *   The **Body** contains a background color (e.g., 3, 1, 7, 9) and several solid rectangular blocks of distinct colors.\n    *   Crucially, the Body contains a \"seed\" pattern of color `8` (teal), usually a square block (2x2 or 3x3), located somewhere in the background.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   **Header Removal:** The top 6 rows (Header) are completely removed. The output grid corresponds to the dimensions of the Body.\n    *   **Block Persistence:** All colored rectangular blocks from the input Body are preserved in the output with their original colors and positions.\n    *   **Path Generation (Color 8):** A network of \"wires\" (color `8`) is generated to connect the blocks. The geometry of this network is derived from the \"seed\":\n        *   **Main Vertical Wire:** An `8`-colored strip (width matching the seed) extends vertically from the seed's columns. It goes up to the top of the grid and down to the bottom, but it **stops** if it hits a colored block (it does not overwrite blocks).\n        *   **Main Horizontal Wire:** An `8`-colored strip (height matching the seed) extends horizontally from the seed's rows. It goes left and right until it hits a colored block or the grid boundary.\n    *   **Connectivity:** The network connects the blocks. Side blocks (left/right) are typically connected by the horizontal wire. Top/Bottom blocks are connected by the vertical wire. The wires fill the space between blocks but never overwrite them.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Grid Dimensions:** The input has 30 rows. The Header is rows 0-5. The Body is rows 6-29 (24 rows). The Output will be 24 rows high.\n2.  **Identify Features in Body:**\n    *   **Background:** Color `9` (Maroon).\n    *   **Seed:** A 3x3 block of `8`s at Input rows 13-15 (Body rows 7-9), Columns 8-10.\n    *   **Block 1 (Blue):** Strip at Left. Input rows 12-21 (Body rows 6-15), Columns 0-2.\n    *   **Block 2 (Red):** Large block at Top-Left. Input rows 6-8 (Body rows 0-2), Columns 0-20.\n    *   **Block 3 (Green):** Strip at Top-Right. Input rows 6-18 (Body rows 0-12), Columns 21-23.\n    *   **Block 4 (Yellow):** Block at Bottom-Center. Input rows 23-25 (Body rows 17-19), Columns 7-15.\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   **Copy Blocks:** Place Block 1, Block 2, Block 3, and Block 4 on the `9` background.\n    *   **Draw Main Vertical Wire:**\n        *   Columns 8-10 (from seed).\n        *   Extends from Top (Row 0) to Bottom (Row 19, Block 4).\n        *   Constraint: Block 2 occupies Rows 0-2 at these columns. So the wire starts at Row 3.\n        *   Constraint: Block 4 starts at Row 17. So the wire stops at Row 16.\n        *   **Result:** Vertical `8`s at Cols 8-10, Rows 3-16.\n    *   **Draw Main Horizontal Wire:**\n        *   Rows 7-9 (from seed).\n        *   Extends Left to Block 1 (ends at Col 2). So wire starts at Col 3.\n        *   Extends Right to Block 3 (starts at Col 21). So wire ends at Col 20.\n        *   **Result:** Horizontal `8`s at Rows 7-9, Cols 3-20.\n    *   **Intersection:** The vertical and horizontal wires overlap at Rows 7-9, Cols 8-10.\n\n**Final Grid Details:**\n*   **Rows 0-2:** Block 2 (0-20), Block 3 (21-23).\n*   **Rows 3-5:** Block 3 (21-23), Vertical Wire (8-10). Background 9 elsewhere.\n*   **Row 6:** Block 1 (0-2), Block 3 (21-23), Vertical Wire (8-10). Background 9.\n*   **Rows 7-9 (Cross):** Block 1 (0-2), Horizontal Wire (3-20, covering the vertical section), Block 3 (21-23).\n*   **Rows 10-12:** Block 1 (0-2), Block 3 (21-23), Vertical Wire (8-10). Background 9.\n*   **Rows 13-15:** Block 1 (0-2), Vertical Wire (8-10). Background 9. (Block 3 ended).\n*   **Row 16:** Vertical Wire (8-10). Background 9.

Okay, let's break this down. It's a grid, and it seems to involve some kind of transformation rules based on the arrangement of numbers (0-9). The request requires a step-by-step, hidden-thought process with a final grid output. No problem; I love a good puzzle.\n\n**The first thing is to analyze the examples.** These grids are massive, and the transformation seems to be contained in the bottom portion. There are these \"header\" sections at the top which define a transformation operation based on a set of numbers. It looks like the header is an instruction bar that describes how the lower portion should be transformed by interpreting a mapping of color to a transformation. By comparing input and output, I see that the Teal number 8 is the key number, and it appears to expand based on values in the instruction bar. If a color is detected in the input body, it might be reflected in the transformation based on the header instruction.\n\n**The question is, how do I find the transformation?** It must be based on numbers, positions and the relationships between them. After examining the header section, I am led to understand that those numbers may be a form of direction codes. It looks like the header numbers point directions which control the expansion of these numbered blocks.\n\n**The second important concept is that of \"attractors.\"** It looks like the active color, which is 8, emits a beam which expands outwards, until it hits the attracted wall. The key to the problem is this: The colors and positions of these header values have a relationship to the transformation of an \"imprint.\" If two cells are in line, a beam will extend in that direction until it collides with a wall in the input body, leaving the 8 in the beam's path.\n\n**Now, let's create a generalized \"Imprint and Fill\" rule:** Each color in the header tells the program to look in the target image for other areas of those same colors. When the code finds these areas of like colors in the image, the program will generate an area of the target number (8), based on the position, facing and dimensions.\n\n**Apply this to the test input!**\nThere are four colors to focus on. Based on the rules, the code will construct the vertical, and the horizontal strip (columns 8,9,10, and rows 7,8,9, respectively.) Since the numbers are arranged in such a way, the central value will be duplicated in the form of a cross, connecting through those numbers. This is where the outputted grids will be created.\n\nBased on this, I've outlined a step-by-step process of cell modification for the target grid. It's time to create the grid from the instruction code. The work is mostly done! I know the values I need and how to construct the image to send to the user!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to infer a transformation rule from three examples and apply it to a test input. The input grids consist of a \"header\" section (rows 0-5) and a \"body\" section (row 6 onwards). The header contains a sequence of numbers separated by 5s. The body contains various colored shapes on a background.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Header Interpretation:** The header encodes a set of \"Active Colors\" or \"Attractors\". We extract the non-zero, non-five numbers from the header blocks.\n    *   Example 1 Header: `1`, `6`, `4`, `2`.\n    *   Example 2 Header: `2`, `4`, `6`, `3`.\n    *   Test Input Header: `1`, `3`, `2`, `4`.\n\n2.  **Role of the Central Object:** In the body, there is a distinct central object of a specific color (Teal/8 in all examples). This object acts as the \"Source\".\n\n3.  **Transformation Logic (The Cross/Beam Effect):**\n    *   The transformation involves extending \"beams\" of the Source color (8) from the Source object towards the specific \"Attractor\" colors found in the header.\n    *   **Beam Formation:** If an Attractor region aligns with the Source object along a cardinal direction (horizontal or vertical), a beam of the Source color fills the gap between them.\n    *   **Beam Dimensions:**\n        *   The **width** of the beam (perpendicular to its direction) matches the width/height of the Source object.\n        *   The **length** of the beam extends from the edge of the Source to the edge of the Attractor.\n    *   If two Attractors are on opposite sides (e.g., Left and Right) and both align with the Source, the beams merge to form a continuous line passing through the Source.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Header Colors:** 1, 3, 2, 4.\n*   **Body Layout:**\n    *   **Source (8):** A 3x3 block of Teal (8) at Rows 7-9 and Columns 8-10 (0-indexed relative to the body start).\n    *   **Attractor 1 (Blue/1):** A wall on the Left (Cols 0-2), spanning Rows 6-15. It aligns horizontally with the Source (Rows 7-9).\n    *   **Attractor 3 (Green/3):** A wall on the Right (Cols 21-23), spanning Rows 0-12. It aligns horizontally with the Source (Rows 7-9).\n    *   **Attractor 2 (Red/2):** A wall on the Top (Rows 0-2), spanning Cols 0-20.

The goal seems to be transforming a grid based on three examples and a test input. Here's my thought process:\n\n**Understanding the Input:**\n\nFirst, I need to get a handle on the input data. It's a grid with a gray separator line, and above it, a \"legend.\" The legend has black boxes with colored vertical bars and numbers. The key seems to be a connection between the bar color, the number inside the box, and what's happening in the main grid below the separator.\n\nLet's look at Example 1: The legend shows a sequence of colors (blue, magenta, yellow, red) corresponding to four boxes. Below, in the main grid, I see colored rectangles, and a 2x2 Teal (color 8) \"seed\". The output of this example has the seed expanding into a partitioning structure and the existing rectangles in the same locations. \n\nThe output creates a grid with 8s (teal) separating the compartments defined by the colors in the input grid. I see that the order of the colors in the legend might matter, possibly mapping to left, top, right, bottom. The outputs in other examples have the same basic structure.\n\nI'm starting to think the primary task is to find the central teal structure and then extend it based on existing rectangles. It seems the Legend dictates the rectangles, so if there is a rectangle missing from the input, the output has background, but if a rectangle *is* present, the output preserves and partitions based on that rectangle.\n\nI'm seeing that the structure's shape is consistent; it starts from a central seed and creates a sort of cross or grid, with the teal color marking the boundaries of cells. The goal is to separate the grid with teal 8s as defined by the seed, with any rectangles in the original grid acting as barriers to the spread of the teal color.\n\nLet's look at Example 2. The legend format might vary, but the color order seems important. It also has this teal seed, and the same basic output behavior of drawing a grid-like structure around the seed. Let's trace all of this back to the core logic. The key is in how the teal color extends.\n\nThe transformation seems to be: find the central Teal (8) seed; extend lines from it in four directions, stopping at existing colored rectangles or, if missing, to the grid's edge, using the seed's geometry to generate the horizontal and vertical lines.\n\n**Examining the Test Input**\n\nNow, with my hypothesis on the transformation, it's time to check the specific Test Input. The logic should be the same, so it's a matter of finding the seed, noting the layout of rectangles, and extending the teal structure in the output grid.\n\nI analyze the test input and identify the 3x3 seed. The seed's rows and columns overlap with some of the original rectangles, which means the initial cross structure extends into those rectangles. Now I'm carefully constructing the output matrix. I will build an output grid in code by overwriting with the 8 color based on seed location and rectangle positions.\n\nI will have horizontal and vertical bars extending from this central seed, filling in between rectangles, keeping in mind the width and positions.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nMy final solution: construct a cross shape of 8s by extending the existing central seed horizontally to the left, and right, and extending vertically from the top and bottom of the seed position. The code will simply traverse the input grid to locate the positions. The output grid is created by just extending the existing rectangles.\n\nOkay, I'm confident in my understanding of this. Let's get to coding!\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we need to infer the transformation rule from the provided examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Structure:** The input consists of a top \"legend\" section (separated by a row of 5s) and a main grid below. The legend appears to indicate the colors involved, but the geometric logic in the main grid is self-contained. The output contains only the transformed main grid.\n\n2.  **Key Elements:**\n    *   **Seed:** In the main grid, there is a small, central isolated block of **Teal (8)** pixels (size 2x2 or 3x3).\n    *   **Rectangles:** There are large, solid-colored rectangular regions located at the periphery (Left, Right, Top, Bottom) of the grid.\n    *   **Background:** The rest of the grid is filled with a background color (e.g., 3, 1, 7, 9).\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   The **Teal (8)** seed expands into a **connected orthogonal structure** (a cross or grid) that partitions the main field.\n    *   **Horizontal Extension:** A horizontal bar of Teal (8) extends from the seed's row(s) to the Left and Right.\n        *   It extends until it touches the inner vertical edges of the Left and Right colored rectangles.\n        *   It fills the space between these rectangles with the seed's width/height.\n    *   **Vertical Extension:** A vertical bar of Teal (8) extends from the seed's column(s) Up and Down.\n        *   It extends until it touches the inner horizontal edges of the Top and Bottom colored rectangles.\n    *   **Intersection:** The original seed location acts as the intersection of these bars.\n    *   **Preservation:** The original peripheral rectangles are preserved. The background is overwritten by the Teal structure in the path of extension, but remains elsewhere.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Components:**\n    *   **Background:** Maroon (9).\n    *   **Rectangles:**\n        *   Top: Red (2), Rows 1-3. Covers Cols 0-20.\n        *   Bottom: Yellow (4), Rows ~24-26. Covers Cols 7-16.\n        *   Left: Blue (1), Rows ~9-18. Covers Cols 0-2.\n        *   Right: Green (3), Rows ~9-15. Covers Cols 21-23.\n    *   **Seed:** Teal (8), 3x3 block. Located at **Rows 14-16** (relative to full input, roughly rows 8-10 of main grid) and **Cols 8-10**.\n\n2.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   The top legend rows are removed.\n    *   **Horizontal Bar:**\n        *   Source: Seed Rows (lines containing the `8,8,8`).\n        *   Span: From Blue rect (ends Col 2) to Green rect (starts Col 21).\n        *   Action: Fill Cols 3 to 20 with Teal (8) on these rows.\n    *   **Vertical Bar:**\n        *   Source: Seed Cols (8, 9, 10).\n        *   Span: From Red rect (ends Row 3) to Yellow rect (starts Row ~24).\n        *   Action: Fill Cols 8-10 with Teal (8) from Row 4 down to the row just before Yellow starts.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Grid Generation (Main Grid):**\n    *   **Rows 1-3:** `2,2...2,3,3,3` (Red/Green/Bg). *No change* (Red covers the vertical path).\n    *   **Rows 4-6:** Background `9`s. *Fill Cols 8-10 with 8*.\n    *   **Row 7:** `1,1,1` (Blue), `9`s, `3,3,3` (Green). *Fill Cols 8-10 with 8*.\n    *   **Rows 8-10 (Seed Rows):** `1,1,1` (Blue), `9`s (with `8,8,8` seed), `3,3,3` (Green).\n        *   *Fill horizontal span:* Cols 3-20 become 8.\n        *   Result: `1,1,1`, followed by `8`s up to Col 20, then `3,3,3`.\n    *   **Rows 11-13:** `1,1,1`, `9`s, `3,3,3`. *Fill Cols 8-10 with 8*.\n    *   **Rows 14-16:** `1,1,1`, `9`s. (Green has ended). *Fill Cols 8-10 with 8*.\n    *   **Row 17:** Background `9`s. *Fill Cols 8-10 with 8*.\n    *   **Rows 18-20:** `9`s, `4,4...` (Yellow), `9`s.\n        *   Yellow is at Cols 7-16. The vertical path (8-10) hits Yellow.\n        *   *Stop vertical line.* No change to this row.\n    *   **Rows 21-24:** Background `9`s. *No change*.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n</REASONING_MODEL_C>\n</CANDIDATE 9>\n</INPUT_DATA>\n\n<AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\nExecute this pipeline sequentially for every Candidate.

Candidate 9\u2019s test grid is consistent with its own cross rule but the rule is falsified by training.</AUDIT_LOG>",

<ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation\n\nThe input is split into two parts:\n\n1) **Instruction panel (top 6 rows)**  \nIt consists of **four 6\u00d76 compartments** (because the grid is 24 columns wide \u2192 4 blocks of 6 columns).  \nInside each compartment, there is a **single vertical strip** of some color (not 0 or 5). Its position gives a turn rule for that color:\n\n- strip on the **left interior column** \u2192 that color means **TURN LEFT**\n- strip on the **right interior column** \u2192 that color means **TURN RIGHT**\n\n(0 and 5 are just framing/background for the instruction panel.)\n\n2) **Board (everything below the all-5 row)**  \nThis is the part we output (same size as the board), after modifying it.\n\nOn the board there is a rectangular **seed block of color 8**. Let its size be **H\u00d7W** (here it\u2019s 3\u00d73). Think of it as a moving \u201ccar\u201d of that exact size.\n\n**Movement simulation**\n- Launch **four copies** of this 8-block from the seed position, with initial directions: **up, down, left, right**.\n- The block moves one cell at a time. It may pass through background cells (the dominant board color; here it\u2019s 9) and through already-8 cells.\n- It **cannot overlap any other color** (these act as walls).\n- As it moves, every background cell covered by the block is recolored to **8** (leaving wall colors unchanged).\n- When it cannot advance because the next step would overlap a wall, it **turns 90\u00b0** according to that wall\u2019s color rule from the instruction panel, then continues.\n- When it cannot advance because the next step would go out of bounds, that moving copy **stops**.\n\nThe final output is the board with the union of all painted trails.\n\n### Applying to the test\nFrom the instruction panel:\n- color **1**: left interior \u2192 **turn left**\n- color **3**: right interior \u2192 **turn right**\n- color **2**: left interior \u2192 **turn left**\n- color **4**: left interior \u2192 **turn left**\n\nOn the board, the seed is a **3\u00d73** block of 8, so the moving block is 3\u00d73.

We discard them and only transform the remaining grid.\n\n### 1) Decode the legend (turn rules)\nThe legend contains 4 small panels across the width. In each panel, one color forms a vertical bar either on the **left** side of the panel\u2019s interior or on the **right** side:\n\n- bar on the **left**  \u2192 that color makes the path **turn left**\n- bar on the **right** \u2192 that color makes the path **turn right**\n\nFrom the test legend:\n- color **1**: left-turn\n- color **3**: right-turn\n- color **2**: left-turn\n- color **4**: left-turn\n\n### 2) Find the starting block and thickness\nIn the main grid (after removing the legend), the only 8s form a solid **3\u00d73** block.  \nThat block is the start, and its size (**k = 3**) is the \u201cthickness\u201d of the moving path.\n\n### 3) Trace thick beams that bounce\nTreat color **9** as empty space to paint on (it\u2019s the dominant background and not listed in the legend). Colors 1/2/3/4 are obstacles; when the moving 8-strip would enter them, it **stops just before** and **turns** according to the legend rule for that color, then continues.\n\nWe emit 4 beams of thickness 3 from the 3\u00d73 seed: **north, south, west, east**.  \nWhenever a beam hits a turn-color, it turns 90\u00b0 and continues, keeping thickness 3 by using the last 3 rows/columns at the impact edge.\n\nIn this test, these bounces produce:\n- a vertical strip at cols 9\u201311 from rows 4\u201317 (stopped by color 2 at the top and color 4 at the bottom),\n- a horizontal strip on rows

color means **TURN RIGHT** (90\u00b0 clockwise)\n\n**3) In the main area there is a solid block of color 8; it is the \u201ccrawler\u201d size.**  \nThe main area contains one solid square of color **8**.  \nIts size is the thickness of the path: in the training examples it is 2\u00d72; in the test it is 3\u00d73.\n\n**4) Draw four paths (up, right, down, left) as a sliding k\u00d7k block.**\n\nLet `k` be the side length of the 8-block. For each of the 4 directions, start with a k\u00d7k block at the 8-block position and repeatedly:\n\n- attempt to move the whole k\u00d7k block by 1 cell in the current direction\n- **if the moved block would go out of bounds, stop**\n- **if the moved block would overlap any non-background, non-8 color, stop before the overlap**, read that blocking color, then **turn** left/right according to the legend and continue from the current position\n- paint every cell visited by any of the four crawlers as **8**\n- never overwrite the colored rectangles; only background cells become 8\n\nThis exactly reproduces the \u201croad network\u201d in all three examples.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\nLegend (row 2 of the input) gives:\n\n- color **1** strip on left \u21d2 **turn left**\n- color **3** strip on right \u21d2 **turn right**\n- color **2** strip on left \u21d2 **turn left**\n- color **4** strip on left \u21d2 **turn left**\n\nMain area (after removing 6 legend rows) has a **3\u00d73** block of 8 at rows 8\u201310, cols 9\u201311 (so `k=3`).  \nTracing the four crawlers with those turn rules produces the following output grid.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid (24\u00d724)\n\n```text\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"9\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**My current thought process revolves around cracking this ARC puzzle, which involves transforming a grid based on a header section and a body.**  I'm focusing on three examples and a test case, trying to discern the underlying logic. Initially, I'm noting the basic characteristics of the inputs: the gray background in the header, the colored \"sockets\", and how the header is removed to create the output's size. My first observation is that the output seems to be the body with some modifications.\n\nMy intuition is drawn to something like a connecting wiring scheme. Example 1's output shows 8s (teal) that seem to connect the different blocks and the top edge. The header has markers (1, 6, 4, 2) that don't always align perfectly with the block colors. Further, I'm focused on what I'm calling the \"seed\" of 8s, which seems to expand outwards. Through analyzing Example 2, the pattern becomes clearer.\n\nThe blocks must be somehow \"powered\" from the header via a network of wires. Example 2's header has markers 2, 4, 6, and 3. The input body has blocks 2, 3, 4, and 6. The wires, identified by 8s, create vertical and horizontal \"buses\" that connect everything. I'm noting that the existing 8s in the body seem to seed the wiring structure, and the logic here is to expand a wire from the blocks that don't get the Main Vertical wire. There are some nuances with edge blocks in the examples.\n\nMy new hypothesis: the wires are seeded in the blocks with the \"0\" pattern. My attention gets drawn to how blocks are connected together in this wiring setup.\n\nI have a unified view: I'm calling the network formed by the seed and header marks the \"Main Cross.\" From that, I draw vertical or horizontal 8s based on the position and configuration of blocks that need additional power. There are specific rules around where these extra vertical lines are drawn, and those seem to be dependent on whether the Header Marker is \"inside\" or \"outside\" the block columns. I'm starting to think this is robust.\n\nI've got the final formula. I'll test it on the input test to make sure, using the formula, and verify the outcome.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I first analyzed the structure of the input and output grids across the provided examples.\n\n**Observations:**\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input consists of a \"Header\" (top 6 rows, background color 5) and a \"Body\" (remaining rows, variable background color).\n    *   The **Header** contains \"sockets\" (patterns of black `0`s) and colored \"markers\" (single pixels like `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `6`). These markers seem to correspond to the colors of rectangular blocks found in the Body.\n    *   The **Body** contains a background color (e.g., 3, 1, 7, 9) and several solid rectangular blocks of distinct colors.\n    *   Crucially, the Body contains a \"seed\" pattern of color `8` (teal), usually a square block (2x2 or 3x3), located somewhere in the background.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   **Header Removal:** The top 6 rows (Header) are completely removed. The output grid corresponds to the dimensions of the Body.\n    *   **Block Persistence:** All colored rectangular blocks from the input Body are preserved in the output with their original colors and positions.\n    *   **Path Generation (Color 8):** A network of \"wires\" (color `8`) is generated to connect the blocks. The geometry of this network is derived from the \"seed\":\n        *   **Main Vertical Wire:** An `8`-colored strip (width matching the seed) extends vertically from the seed's columns. It goes up to the top of the grid and down to the bottom, but it **stops** if it hits a colored block (it does not overwrite blocks).\n        *   **Main Horizontal Wire:** An `8`-colored strip (height matching the seed) extends horizontally from the seed's rows. It goes left and right until it hits a colored block or the grid boundary.\n    *   **Connectivity:** The network connects the blocks. Side blocks (left/right) are typically connected by the horizontal wire. Top/Bottom blocks are connected by the vertical wire. The wires fill the space between blocks but never overwrite them.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Grid Dimensions:** The input has 30 rows. The Header is rows 0-5. The Body is rows 6-29 (24 rows). The Output will be 24 rows high.\n2.  **Identify Features in Body:**\n    *   **Background:** Color `9` (Maroon).\n    *   **Seed:** A 3x3 block of `8`s at Input rows 13-15 (Body rows 7-9), Columns 8-10.\n    *   **Block 1 (Blue):** Strip at Left. Input rows 12-21 (Body rows 6-15), Columns 0-2.\n    *   **Block 2 (Red):** Large block at Top-Left. Input rows 6-8 (Body rows 0-2), Columns 0-20.\n    *   **Block 3 (Green):** Strip at Top-Right. Input rows 6-18 (Body rows 0-12), Columns 21-23.\n    *   **Block 4 (Yellow):** Block at Bottom-Center. Input rows 23-25 (Body rows 17-19), Columns 7-15.\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   **Copy Blocks:** Place Block 1, Block 2, Block 3, and Block 4 on the `9` background.\n    *   **Draw Main Vertical Wire:**\n        *   Columns 8-10 (from seed).\n        *   Extends from Top (Row 0) to Bottom (Row 19, Block 4).\n        *   Constraint: Block 2 occupies Rows 0-2 at these columns. So the wire starts at Row 3.\n        *   Constraint: Block 4 starts at Row 17. So the wire stops at Row 16.\n        *   **Result:** Vertical `8`s at Cols 8-10, Rows 3-16.\n    *   **Draw Main Horizontal Wire:**\n        *   Rows 7-9 (from seed).\n        *   Extends Left to Block 1 (ends at Col 2). So wire starts at Col 3.\n        *   Extends Right to Block 3 (starts at Col 21). So wire ends at Col 20.\n        *   **Result:** Horizontal `8`s at Rows 7-9, Cols 3-20.\n    *   **Intersection:** The vertical and horizontal wires overlap at Rows 7-9, Cols 8-10.\n\n**Final Grid Details:**\n*   **Rows 0-2:** Block 2 (0-20), Block 3 (21-23).\n*   **Rows 3-5:** Block 3 (21-23), Vertical Wire (8-10). Background 9 elsewhere.\n*   **Row 6:** Block 1 (0-2), Block 3 (21-23), Vertical Wire (8-10). Background 9.\n*   **Rows 7-9 (Cross):** Block 1 (0-2), Horizontal Wire (3-20, covering the vertical section), Block 3 (21-23).\n*   **Rows 10-12:** Block 1 (0-2), Block 3 (21-23), Vertical Wire (8-10). Background 9.\n*   **Rows 13-15:** Block 1 (0-2), Vertical Wire (8-10). Background 9. (Block 3 ended).\n*   **Row 16:** Vertical Wire (8-10). Background 9. (Block 1 ended).\n*   **Rows 17-19:** Block 4 (7-15).

Okay, let's break this down. It's a grid, and it seems to involve some kind of transformation rules based on the arrangement of numbers (0-9). The request requires a step-by-step, hidden-thought process with a final grid output. No problem; I love a good puzzle.\n\n**The first thing is to analyze the examples.** These grids are massive, and the transformation seems to be contained in the bottom portion. There are these \"header\" sections at the top which define a transformation operation based on a set of numbers. It looks like the header is an instruction bar that describes how the lower portion should be transformed by interpreting a mapping of color to a transformation. By comparing input and output, I see that the Teal number 8 is the key number, and it appears to expand based on values in the instruction bar. If a color is detected in the input body, it might be reflected in the transformation based on the header instruction.\n\n**The question is, how do I find the transformation?** It must be based on numbers, positions and the relationships between them. After examining the header section, I am led to understand that those numbers may be a form of direction codes. It looks like the header numbers point directions which control the expansion of these numbered blocks.\n\n**The second important concept is that of \"attractors.\"** It looks like the active color, which is 8, emits a beam which expands outwards, until it hits the attracted wall. The key to the problem is this: The colors and positions of these header values have a relationship to the transformation of an \"imprint.\" If two cells are in line, a beam will extend in that direction until it collides with a wall in the input body, leaving the 8 in the beam's path.\n\n**Now, let's create a generalized \"Imprint and Fill\" rule:** Each color in the header tells the program to look in the target image for other areas of those same colors. When the code finds these areas of like colors in the image, the program will generate an area of the target number (8), based on the position, facing and dimensions.\n\n**Apply this to the test input!**\nThere are four colors to focus on. Based on the rules, the code will construct the vertical, and the horizontal strip (columns 8,9,10, and rows 7,8,9, respectively.) Since the numbers are arranged in such a way, the central value will be duplicated in the form of a cross, connecting through those numbers. This is where the outputted grids will be created.\n\nBased on this, I've outlined a step-by-step process of cell modification for the target grid. It's time to create the grid from the instruction code. The work is mostly done! I know the values I need and how to construct the image to send to the user!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to infer a transformation rule from three examples and apply it to a test input. The input grids consist of a \"header\" section (rows 0-5) and a \"body\" section (row 6 onwards). The header contains a sequence of numbers separated by 5s. The body contains various colored shapes on a background.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Header Interpretation:** The header encodes a set of \"Active Colors\" or \"Attractors\". We extract the non-zero, non-five numbers from the header blocks.\n    *   Example 1 Header: `1`, `6`, `4`, `2`.\n    *   Example 2 Header: `2`, `4`, `6`, `3`.\n    *   Test Input Header: `1`, `3`, `2`, `4`.\n\n2.  **Role of the Central Object:** In the body, there is a distinct central object of a specific color (Teal/8 in all examples). This object acts as the \"Source\".\n\n3.  **Transformation Logic (The Cross/Beam Effect):**\n    *   The transformation involves extending \"beams\" of the Source color (8) from the Source object towards the specific \"Attractor\" colors found in the header.\n    *   **Beam Formation:** If an Attractor region aligns with the Source object along a cardinal direction (horizontal or vertical), a beam of the Source color fills the gap between them.\n    *   **Beam Dimensions:**\n        *   The **width** of the beam (perpendicular to its direction) matches the width/height of the Source object.\n        *   The **length** of the beam extends from the edge of the Source to the edge of the Attractor.\n    *   If two Attractors are on opposite sides (e.g., Left and Right) and both align with the Source, the beams merge to form a continuous line passing through the Source.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Header Colors:** 1, 3, 2, 4.\n*   **Body Layout:**\n    *   **Source (8):** A 3x3 block of Teal (8) at Rows 7-9 and Columns 8-10 (0-indexed relative to the body start).\n    *   **Attractor 1 (Blue/1):** A wall on the Left (Cols 0-2), spanning Rows 6-15. It aligns horizontally with the Source (Rows 7-9).\n    *   **Attractor 3 (Green/3):** A wall on the Right (Cols 21-23), spanning Rows 0-12. It aligns horizontally with the Source (Rows 7-9).\n    *   **Attractor 2 (Red/2):** A wall on the Top (Rows 0-2), spanning Cols 0-20. It aligns vertically with the Source (Cols 8-10).\n    *   **Attractor 4 (Yellow/4):** A block on the Bottom (Rows 17-19), spanning Cols 7-15. It aligns vertically with the Source (Cols 8-10).\n\n*   **Step 1: Horizontal Beam**\n    *   Connects Left Wall (1) and Right Wall (3) through the Source.\n    *   **Y-range:** Rows 7, 8, 9 (The rows of the Source).\n    *   **X-range:** From the end of the Left Wall (Col 3) to the start of the Right Wall (Col 20).\n    *   **Action:** Fill this rectangular region with 8s.\n\n*   **Step 2: Vertical Beam**\n    *   Connects Top Wall (2) and Bottom Block (4) through the Source.\n    *   **X-range:** Cols 8, 9, 10 (The columns of the Source).\n    *   **Y-range:** From the bottom of the Top Wall (Row 3) to the top of the Bottom Block (Row 16).\n    *   **Action:** Fill this rectangular region with 8s.\n\n*   **Result:** A cross shape of 8s is drawn over the background (9), connecting the four surrounding shapes. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n(Body is 24x24)\n- Rows 0-2: `2`s and `3`s (Unchanged).\n- Rows 3-6: Vertical beam of `8`s at Cols 8-10.\n- Rows 7-9: Horizontal beam of `8`s at Cols 3-20 (Intersecting the vertical beam).\n- Rows 10-16: Vertical beam of `8`s at Cols 8-10.\n- Rows 17-23: `4`s and `9`s (Unchanged).\n\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Analyzing and Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into this ARC task. The goal seems to be transforming a grid based on three examples and a test input. Here's my thought process:\n\n**Understanding the Input:**\n\nFirst, I need to get a handle on the input data. It's a grid with a gray separator line, and above it, a \"legend.\" The legend has black boxes with colored vertical bars and numbers. The key seems to be a connection between the bar color, the number inside the box, and what's happening in the main grid below the separator.\n\nLet's look at Example 1: The legend shows a sequence of colors (blue, magenta, yellow, red) corresponding to four boxes. Below, in the main grid, I see colored rectangles, and a 2x2 Teal (color 8) \"seed\". The output of this example has the seed expanding into a partitioning structure and the existing rectangles in the same locations. \n\nThe output creates a grid with 8s (teal) separating the compartments defined by the colors in the input grid. I see that the order of the colors in the legend might matter, possibly mapping to left, top, right, bottom. The outputs in other examples have the same basic structure.\n\nI'm starting to think the primary task is to find the central teal structure and then extend it based on existing rectangles. It seems the Legend dictates the rectangles, so if there is a rectangle missing from the input, the output has background, but if a rectangle *is* present, the output preserves and partitions based on that rectangle.\n\nI'm seeing that the structure's shape is consistent; it starts from a central seed and creates a sort of cross or grid, with the teal color marking the boundaries of cells. The goal is to separate the grid with teal 8s as defined by the seed, with any rectangles in the original grid acting as barriers to the spread of the teal color.\n\nLet's look at Example 2. The legend format might vary, but the color order seems important. It also has this teal seed, and the same basic output behavior of drawing a grid-like structure around the seed. Let's trace all of this back to the core logic. The key is in how the teal color extends.\n\nThe transformation seems to be: find the central Teal (8) seed; extend lines from it in four directions, stopping at existing colored rectangles or, if missing, to the grid's edge, using the seed's geometry to generate the horizontal and vertical lines.\n\n**Examining the Test Input**\n\nNow, with my hypothesis on the transformation, it's time to check the specific Test Input. The logic should be the same, so it's a matter of finding the seed, noting the layout of rectangles, and extending the teal structure in the output grid.\n\nI analyze the test input and identify the 3x3 seed. The seed's rows and columns overlap with some of the original rectangles, which means the initial cross structure extends into those rectangles. Now I'm carefully constructing the output matrix. I will build an output grid in code by overwriting with the 8 color based on seed location and rectangle positions.\n\nI will have horizontal and vertical bars extending from this central seed, filling in between rectangles, keeping in mind the width and positions.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nMy final solution: construct a cross shape of 8s by extending the existing central seed horizontally to the left, and right, and extending vertically from the top and bottom of the seed position. The code will simply traverse the input grid to locate the positions. The output grid is created by just extending the existing rectangles.\n\nOkay, I'm confident in my understanding of this. Let's get to coding!\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we need to infer the transformation rule from the provided examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Structure:** The input consists of a top \"legend\" section (separated by a row of 5s) and a main grid below. The legend appears to indicate the colors involved, but the geometric logic in the main grid is self-contained. The output contains only the transformed main grid.\n\n2.  **Key Elements:**\n    *   **Seed:** In the main grid, there is a small, central isolated block of **Teal (8)** pixels (size 2x2 or 3x3).\n    *   **Rectangles:** There are large, solid-colored rectangular regions located at the periphery (Left, Right, Top, Bottom) of the grid.\n    *   **Background:** The rest of the grid is filled with a background color (e.g., 3, 1, 7, 9).\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   The **Teal (8)** seed expands into a **connected orthogonal structure** (a cross or grid) that partitions the main field.\n    *   **Horizontal Extension:** A horizontal bar of Teal (8) extends from the seed's row(s) to the Left and Right.\n        *   It extends until it touches the inner vertical edges of the Left and Right colored rectangles.\n        *   It fills the space between these rectangles with the seed's width/height.\n    *   **Vertical Extension:** A vertical bar of Teal (8) extends from the seed's column(s) Up and Down.\n        *   It extends until it touches the inner horizontal edges of the Top and Bottom colored rectangles.\n    *   **Intersection:** The original seed location acts as the intersection of these bars.\n    *   **Preservation:** The original peripheral rectangles are preserved. The background is overwritten by the Teal structure in the path of extension, but remains elsewhere.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Components:**\n    *   **Background:** Maroon (9).\n    *   **Rectangles:**\n        *   Top: Red (2), Rows 1-3. Covers Cols 0-20.\n        *   Bottom: Yellow (4), Rows ~24-26. Covers Cols 7-16.\n        *   Left: Blue (1), Rows ~9-18. Covers Cols 0-2.\n        *   Right: Green (3), Rows ~9-15. Covers Cols 21-23.\n    *   **Seed:** Teal (8), 3x3 block.

It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
