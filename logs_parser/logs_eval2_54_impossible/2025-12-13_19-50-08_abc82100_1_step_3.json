        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment & Hypothesis Formation**\n\nAlright, the task seems to be about transforming a grid based on some input, and it's quite a puzzle. My first instinct is to look for patterns and relationships between the input and the desired output. I'm focusing on those examples, which seem to be structured in a way, possibly with headers or instructions embedded within the grid. My hypothesis initially is to decode those instructions, find the logic, and use that logic to predict the missing output.\n\n**Digging Deeper: Examples as Guides**\n\nI see a \"header\" type thing at the beginning of some inputs. The example with the \"1, 2, 8\" header looks promising. 1 being the boundary colour, 2 the result, and 8.. direction? The shape of 1s in the initial data seems to get \"filled\", and 2 is the resultant colour. I believe it's not a simple flood fill; there's a spatial aspect involved with direction, or a boundary. Could that row 0 be providing key details?\n\n**Refining the Theory: Boundaries and Rules**\n\nNow I'm onto the idea that the task involves identifying regions, possibly defined by boundaries, and then *applying* rules within those regions. It's almost like a flood fill with more specific rules or a targeted \"fill\" based on some key instructions at the start of the input. And I'm seeing this \"header\" idea pop up. A \"Control Row\" that defines color conversions and any fill-related direction. But, what if the instructions are more complex or located in the body of the grid itself? That other example has a lot of colors that seems to tell me something, I need more clarity there.\n\n**Color Mapping, Shape Extraction**\n\nNow I'm really starting to see a pattern. It's about taking specific shapes from the input, applying some kind of colour replacement, and then possibly filling them in a particular way. So a core task seems to revolve around shape extraction, followed by a controlled transformation: a new color and potentially a new shape? It seems that this colour relationship is key, and I need to determine the origin of the rules.\n\n**The Discovery: Code Generation Within the Grid**\n\nThis is exciting! Now, I see these vertical pixels that hold the keys to all the colours, but not at the very top of the grid. It's like the program is giving us the instruction row *inside* of the data grid. I see an \"A, B, 8\" structure, which looks like the instruction format for colours, maybe? I'm associating the shape with the color key.\n\n**Decomposing the Core Mechanics: Input Markers and Transformation**\n\nSo the core of the problem seems to be the following:\n1. Find a color value sequence with a format `A, B, 8` structure on a horizontal row.\n2. The 8 indicates the boundary color. The sequence (A,B,8) defines a set of rules.\n3. The shape of color 8 then becomes the region to transform.\n4. Process all markers EXCEPT (2,1), (6,2), (10,1). (Note: (2,2), (6,1), (10,2) are the Output Colors, also not markers).\n5. The transformation follows:\n\nIf you find this shape, replace the inner part of it with the color of A. Or maybe it paints it horizontally? I need a test.\n\n**Building a Comprehensive Algorithm**\n\nI think I have everything I need. Now, the main issue is, there's no way to know in which order to go. I need to run this on test data:\n1. Initialize Output Grid (All 0s).\n2. Scan Input for patterns `A, B, 8`.\n   - Take the associated Shape from an 8-color connected object.\n3. Identify all markers (2, 4, 5, etc.) and map those to an action.\n4. Transform the shapes to the new color using the instructions.\n5. Apply Shape: Apply paint the color (B) in the identified shape based on `A, B, 8`.\n6. Apply Paint: Apply the paint (color A) to all locations that are not part of the shape.\n   Apply the fill based on instruction A.\n\nThe final step will be to make sure to create the right shapes in the right colors, and I will be done.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\nThe examples show a pattern where the input grid contains \"instructions\" or \"keys\" that define how to transform specific markers into shapes.\n- **Example 1** shows a header `1,2,8` and a shape of `1`s. The `1`s are replaced by `2`s and filled (in this case, extended to the right).\n- **Example 3** shows shapes (outlines) of `1`s, `4`s, and `8`s being replaced by filled shapes of `7`s, `2`s, and `2`s respectively. The transformation key seems to be vertical pairs of pixels.\n- **Example 4** shows a region bounded by a color being filled.\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\nThe test input contains three distinct structures on the left side (columns 0-8) that look like \"Legends\" or \"Rules\". Each rule consists of a pair of colored pixels (representing the instruction) attached to a shape made of color `8` (teal).\n1.  **Rule 1 (Row 2):** At `(2,1)` is `4` (yellow) and `(2,2)` is `1` (blue). This pair is adjacent to a vertical line of `8`s at `(1,3)-(3,3)`.\n    -   Interpretation: Marker `4` transforms into the Shape of `8`s (Vertical Line), painted with Color `1`.\n    -   The \"Handle\" (connection point) of the shape is at `(2,3)`, the center of the line.\n\n2.  **Rule 2 (Row 6):** At `(6,1)` is `2` (red) and `(6,2)` is `4` (yellow). This pair is adjacent to a diamond of `8`s centered at `(6,4)`.\n    -   Interpretation: Marker `2` transforms into the Shape of `8`s (Diamond), painted with Color `4`.\n    -   The \"Handle\" is at `(6,3)`, the left point of the diamond.\n\n3.  **Rule 3 (Row 10):** At `(10,1)` is `5` (gray) and `(10,2)` is `7` (orange). This pair is adjacent to a cross/T-shape of `8`s.\n    -   Interpretation: Marker `5` transforms into the Shape of `8`s (Cross), painted with Color `7`.\n    -   The \"Handle\" is at `(10,3)`, the left arm of the cross.\n\n**Transformation Process:**\nWe scan the entire grid for \"Markers\" matching the input colors of the rules (`4`, `2`, `5`). We then \"stamp\" the corresponding shape in the output color at that location, aligning the shape's handle with the marker's position. All other pixels (rules, debris like `6`s, `1`s) are treated as background (0).\n\n**Marker Processing:**\n-   **Markers `4` (transform to Color `1` Line):**\n    -   `(5,17)`, `(9,13)`, `(15,9)`, `(17,13)`.\n-   **Markers `2` (transform to Color `4` Diamond):**\n    -   `(1,0)`, `(12,16)`, `(14,1)`, `(14,5)`, `(14,13)`.\n-   **Markers `5` (transform to Color `7` Cross):**\n    -   `(3,13)`, `(8,18)`, `(10,9)`, `(16,2)`, `(19,0)`.\n\n**Calculated Output Coordinates:**\n\n*   **From Marker `2` at `(1,0)` -> Diamond (Color 4):**\n    `(0,1)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,2)`, `(2,1)`.\n*   **From Marker `5` at `(3,13)` -> Cross (Color 7):**\n    `(2,14)`, `(3,13)`, `(3,14)`, `(4,14)`.\n*   **From Marker `4` at `(5,17)` -> Line (Color 1):**\n    `(4,17)`, `(5,17)`, `(6,17)`.\n*   **From Marker `5` at `(8,18)` -> Cross (Color 7):**\n    `(7,19)`, `(8,18)`, `(8,19)`, `(9,19)`.\n*   **From Marker `4` at `(9,13)` -> Line (Color 1):**\n    `(8,13)`, `(9,13)`, `(10,13)`.\n*   **From Marker `5` at `(10,9)` -> Cross (Color 7):**\n    `(9,10)`, `(10,9)`, `(10,10)`, `(11,10)`.\n*   **From Marker `2` at `(12,16)` -> Diamond (Color 4):**\n    `(11,17)`, `(12,16)`, `(12,18)`, `(13,17)`.\n*   **From Marker `2` at `(14,1)` -> Diamond (Color 4):**\n    `(13,2)`, `(14,1)`, `(14,3)`, `(15,2)`.\n*   **From Marker `2` at `(14,5)` -> Diamond (Color 4):**\n    `(13,6)`, `(14,5)`, `(14,7)`, `(15,6)`.\n*   **From Marker `2` at `(14,13)` -> Diamond (Color 4):**\n    `(13,14)`, `(14,13)`, `(14,15)`, `(15,14)`.\n*   **From Marker `4` at `(15,9)` -> Line (Color 1):**\n    `(14,9)`, `(15,9)`, `(16,9)`.\n*   **From Marker `5` at `(16,2)` -> Cross (Color 7):**\n    `(15,3)`, `(16,2)`, `(16,3)`, `(17,3)`.\n*   **From Marker `4` at `(17,13)` -> Line (Color 1):**\n    `(16,13)`, `(17,13)`, `(18,13)`.\n*   **From Marker `5` at `(19,0)` -> Cross (Color 7):**\n    `(18,1)`, `(19,0)`, `(19,1)`.\n\noutput:\n0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0\n0,4,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,7,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment & Hypothesis Formation**\n\nAlright, the task at hand is to solve an ARC puzzle based on four example grids. It seems like each example presents a visual transformation of a grid. My initial thought is to identify the core mechanism behind these transformations. I'm looking for patterns, rules, or key features that change from input to output.\n\n**Initial Analysis & Pattern Recognition**\n\nI started by looking for distinct objects in the grid: colored pixels, lines, shapes, and their arrangement. I noted the specific values and colors. In the first example, I saw a horizontal line, a vertical line, and a single \"red\" pixel, a potential focal point. My hypothesis began to form: The output seems derived from particular input elements and their relative positions.  I focused on these elements.\n\n**Building & Refining the Central Idea:  Color Transformation**\n\nOne key observation: some colors seemed to be \"sources\" and others \"targets\". In the first example, the '2' and vertical line of '1'  are significant. The output was filled with the '2' color, suggesting the '1' structure was being recolored or replicated. Example 2 introduced more complexity, containing a \"maze\" of objects. I thought, the patterns within the grid, such as \"wires\" or shapes, were being \"filled\" by a particular color. 8s might act as boundaries, separating distinct, color-filled regions. \n\n**Iterative Rule Refinement: The Core Rule & Components**\n\nI identified that 8s might be \"walls\" or boundaries, so I explored the concepts of connectedness and regions. The algorithm probably needs to handle \"regions\" separately. I came to the hypothesis of 'Source' and 'Target' and the \"fill\" mechanism. The goal now is to establish if these ideas fit into a single rule. Is there a consistent logic to how color gets \"transferred\" or where \"fill\" happens?\n\nI continued testing the rule and explored whether color transformation was swapping or recoloring. This rule has to explain:\n1.  How regions are identified (connected by adjacent color or via \"conductive\" 8s, or both).\n2.  How the \u201csource\u201d color is defined (single pixel, most frequent pixel etc)\n3. How the \"Target\" is defined. \n4. The texture of fill.\n\nI'm confident that the 8s are key to defining regions. And the color of the Source is the key factor. Maybe \"Texture\" is determined by the input - if solid, fill is solid, if sparse, fill is sparse. \n\n**Testing & Generalizing: Further Examples & a Proposed Solution**\n\nI kept on testing the theory on examples and came up with a set of iterative rules. \n\nI'm now thinking: the input grid can be understood as a *state*. \nThe \"Instructions\" are on one side (Left, Top)\nThe color transformation occurs for \"Right\" side.  \nThe core of the process is to divide the grid into sections, extract instructions from the left side, apply them to the right. \n\n**Developing & Testing: Applying to the Test Input**\n\nI applied the above rule to the test grid.\nIn summary, the 8-Spine splits the grid. \nFrom the left, there is a set of Key:Value mappings \nThese are applied to the values, from Right. \nI have a list of Key-Value, such as  (1: 4), (2: 4) etc. \nIf an object on the right matches the value, swap with a color\nIn the final step, after applying the instructions, non-mapped colors from the right get set to 0.\n\nThe process has a series of steps: \n1. The grid is split into sections based on 8's \n2. A instruction or mapping is found for each section. \n3. Pixels get moved from Right to 0 if no map is found.\n\nThe current challenge is to find a set of clear rules and to identify single or pattern source or target and to clarify the fill, swap operation.\n\n**Refinement & Verification**\nI made the rules consistent with examples, so I will now implement these.\n\n\nThe problem involves transforming a grid based on \"instructions\" encoded within the grid itself. The grid is divided into sections by a vertical \"spine\" of teal (8) pixels. To the left of this spine, there are specific color patterns that act as rules or legends. To the right of the spine, there are scattered pixels that need to be transformed according to these rules.\n\n**Analysis of Sections and Rules:**\n\n1.  **Section 1 (Top, Rows 0-4):**\n    *   **Separator:** The 8-spine has nodes at rows 1-3.\n    *   **Instruction (Left):** In Row 2, we see a pair of pixels: Yellow (4) at (2,1) and Blue (1) at (2,2). This defines a **Swap Rule: 4 <-> 1**.\n    *   **Target (Right):**\n        *   Pixel at (2,10) is Blue (1). Applying the rule: 1 becomes 4.\n        *   Pixel at (3,13) is Gray (5). 5 is not in {4, 1}, so it is removed (becomes 0).\n        *   Pixels at (0,17), (1,7), (1,19) are Magenta (6). Not in rule, removed.\n\n2.  **Section 2 (Middle, Rows 5-8):**\n    *   **Separator:** The 8-spine has a diamond shape at rows 5-7.\n    *   **Instruction (Left):** In Row 6, we see a pair: Red (2) at (6,1) and Yellow (4) at (6,2). This defines a **Swap Rule: 2 <-> 4**.\n    *   **Target (Right):**\n        *   Pixel at (5,17) is Yellow (4). Applying the rule: 4 becomes 2.\n        *   Pixel at (6,11) is Red (2). Applying the rule: 2 becomes 4.\n        *   Pixel at (8,18) is Gray (5). Not in rule, removed.\n\n3.  **Section 3 (Lower Middle, Rows 9-12):**\n    *   **Separator:** The 8-spine has nodes at rows 9-11.\n    *   **Instruction (Left):** In Row 10, we see a pair: Gray (5) at (10,1) and Orange (7) at (10,2). This defines a **Swap Rule: 5 <-> 7**.\n    *   **Target (Right):**\n        *   Pixel at (10,9) is Gray (5). Applying the rule: 5 becomes 7.\n        *   Pixel at (9,13) is Yellow (4). Not in rule, removed.\n        *   Pixel at (12,16) is Red (2). Not in rule, removed.\n\n4.  **Section 4 (Bottom, Rows 13-19):**\n    *   **Separator:** No 8-spine nodes here.\n    *   **Instruction (Left):**\n        *   Row 14 has a single Red (2). This implies a filter \"Keep 2\".\n        *   Row 17 has a single Gray (5). This implies a filter \"Keep 5\".\n        *   Row 19 has a single Gray (5). This implies a filter \"Keep 5\".\n    *   **Target (Right):**\n        *   Pixel at (14,13) is Red (2). Matches filter. Stays 2.\n        *   Pixel at (14,19) is Magenta (6). Removed.\n        *   Pixels at (15,9), (17,13) are Yellow (4). Removed.\n        *   Pixels at (17,17), (19,9) are Magenta (6). Removed.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nThe output grid is all black (0) except for the transformed pixels identified above.\n\n*   (2, 10) -> 4\n*   (5, 17) -> 2\n*   (6, 11) -> 4\n*   (10, 9) -> 7\n*   (14, 13) -> 2\n\nAll other pixels, including the 8-spine and the left-side instructions, are cleared.\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation\n\nAcross the examples, one small adjacent pair of different non\u2011background colors acts like a **legend**:\n\n- One of the two colors is the **ink color** (the color that will appear in the output).\n- The other color is the **source color** (cells that act as emitters).\n- The **direction** from the source cell to the ink cell (up/down/left/right) tells which way the source cells \u201cshine\u201d.\n\nThen:\n\n1. **Everything except the ink that is produced by the sources is discarded** (all original shapes/colors are removed in the output).\n2. **Each source cell emits a cone (a triangular \u201cbeam\u201d)** in the legend direction all the way to the grid edge:\n   - If the direction is right, then for distance `d = 0,1,2,...` the beam reaches column `c+d` and covers rows `r-d ... r+d`.\n   - (Analogously for other directions.)\n3. The cone is filled in a **checkerboard manner**, using the parity of the source cell: a cell in the cone is colored only if `(row+col)` has the **same parity** (even/odd) as `(r+c)` of the source cell.\n4. The output is the **union** of the cones from all source cells.\n\n### Applying to the test\n\nIn the test input, the only clear legend-like adjacent pair is the **5 next to 7** on row 11: `...,5,7,...`.  \nSo:\n- **source color = 5**\n- **ink color = 7**\n- direction is **right** (from 5 \u2192 7)\n\nWe ignore that specific legend instance as just the indicator, and apply the right-pointing checkerboard cone rule from every other `5` in the grid. The resulting output contains only `0` and `7`.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n```csv\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,7,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,7,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n```",
