        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Solution Strategy for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out.  I've been given some examples, and my job is to come up with a rule to transform the input into the output.  It seems to be about identifying regions and filling them according to the pattern within those regions.  There's some kind of \"wall\" or \"separator\" color that is important to recognize.\n\n**Initial Exploration:**\n\nI started by looking at a 16x16 example, noticing that the grid was broken down into different colored regions separated by lines of a specific color (8).  I traced the colors to understand how they changed from input to output.  It seemed that some colors were just preserved, but the \"wall\" color (8) would get overwritten by an adjacent region's primary colors, like the pixels from neighboring regions. Then, I looked at a 10x10 example, where the wall color was 5. I noticed a clear cross shape of those 5s. In the outputs, the 5s were replaced. The regions seemed to be defined by that separator. I also saw that the output 5s were not always replaced, which made it confusing.\n\n**Refining the Idea:**\n\nThe initial idea was \"clean up\" the grid by removing the wall colors and letting the regions' \"patterns\" expand. It looked like some form of flood-fill, or connected components. The wall was a disruption. The key seemed to be making connected components and \"filling\" the walls with the dominant color in that area.\n\n**Connecting Components and the Main Pattern**\n\nI figured out that the problem seems to be an iterative pattern expansion:\n\n1.  Identify \"Wall,\" \"Background,\" and \"Pattern\" colors.\n2.  If it is a wall pixel, replace the wall pixels with the color of the adjacent pattern.\n\nBased on the examples, the walls were usually one pixel thick but could get a little noisy.\nThe main \"wall\" colors are:\n-   8 in example 1\n-   5 in example 2\n-   7 in example 3.\nI could find the non-wall pixels by identifying them using their color, or by finding the connected components of the \"wall\".\n\nI initially thought about the distance from the non-wall neighbors, but then realized it was simpler.\n\nThe rule:\n1.  **Define Wall color:** The color that visually outlines the regions.\n2.  **Define background color:** Large area covering other regions, for Ex 1.\n3.  **Iterate Through Wall Pixels**. For each wall pixel. find its neighboring pixels.\n4.  **Find the pattern pixels' color**: Choose the neighbor's color that is not a background or a wall.\n\nThis strategy helped me understand the transformation. This is what I applied to the test case, finding a 30 x 30 grid with 4 as wall. The logic was to let the background, Pattern colors overwrite wall color.\n\n**Validation**\n\nI double checked with the examples, and the test code.\n\nNow, I think I have it. I need to run this on the actual test input.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify the transformation rule from the solved examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The inputs consist of regions of \"pattern\" colors (like 3, 2, 6) separated by \"wall\" or \"grid\" lines of a specific color (8 in Ex 1, 5 in Ex 2, 7 in Ex 3).\n2.  **Transformation:** The \"wall\" pixels are replaced by colors from the adjacent regions.\n3.  **Hierarchy/Priority:**\n    *   There appears to be a \"Background\" color in each example which is a solid, large area color (9 in Ex 1, 0 in Ex 2, 8 in Ex 3).\n    *   There are \"Pattern\" colors which are the distinct regions (3/4 in Ex 1, 1/2 in Ex 2, 6/5 in Ex 3).\n    *   **Rule:** Wall pixels are replaced by the adjacent **Pattern** color. If a wall separates a Pattern region and a Background region, the Pattern color expands into the wall. If a wall separates two Pattern regions, it likely takes the color of the nearest one. If a wall is surrounded only by Background, it becomes Background.\n    *   Specifically, in Example 1, the wall (8) between the noisy 3/4 region and the background 9 region becomes 3 (the dominant color of the noisy region). The wall between the background 9 and the 4 region becomes 4.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Roles:**\n    *   **Wall Color:** 4 (Forms horizontal and vertical lines separating regions).\n    *   **Background Color:** 6 (Occupies the large Top-Right and Middle areas, separating the distinct Top-Left and Bottom-Right regions).\n    *   **Pattern Colors:**\n        *   **3:** Dominates the Top-Left region (with some 2s mixed in).\n        *   **2:** Dominates the Bottom-Right region.\n        *   **3 & 2:** Small cluster in the Bottom-Left.\n\n2.  **Execution:** We iterate through the \"Wall\" pixels (4) and replace them based on connectivity:\n    *   **Top-Left Boundary:** The vertical wall at Column 9 (rows 0-9) and horizontal wall at Row 9 (cols 0-9) border the Top-Left 3-region. They are replaced by **3**.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Boundary:** The walls bordering the Bottom-Right 2-region (Row 20 cols 14-29, and the vertical/irregular boundary around cols 13-15 in rows 21-22) are replaced by **2**.\n    *   **Bottom-Left Cluster:** There is a small mixed region of 3s and 2s in the bottom left (rows 21-25). The 4s touching the 3s become **3**, and the 4s touching the 2s become **2**.\n    *   **Background Areas:** The 4s inside the 6-regions (Top-Right, Middle) or separating 6-regions are replaced by **6**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Replacement:**\n*   **Row 9 (Cols 0-9):** Input `4`s become **3**.\n*   **Col 9 (Rows 0-9):** Input `4`s become **3**. Intersection at (9,9) becomes 3.\n*   **Row 20 (Cols 14-29):** Input `4`s become **2** (bordering the 2-region below).\n*   **Row 21:**\n    *   Cols 0-2 (`4,4,4`): Touch the 3-region below. Become **3**.\n    *   Col 6 (`4`): Inside 6-region. Becomes **6**.\n    *   Col 12 (`4`): Inside 6-region. Becomes **6**.\n    *   Col 15 (`4`): Touches 2-region. Becomes **2**.\n*   **Row 22:**\n    *   Cols 2-6 (`4,4,4,4,4`):\n        *   Col 2 touches 3 (left). Becomes **3**.\n        *   Col 3 touches 3 (new left). Becomes **3**.\n        *   ... Col 6 touches 3 chain. Becomes **3**. (Pattern expands over BG).\n    *   Cols 12-15 (`4,4,4`): Touch 2-region (right/below). Become **2**.\n*   **Row 23:**\n    *   Col 2 (`4`): Touches 2 (left). Becomes **2**.\n    *   Other 4s in 6-region become **6**.\n*   **Row 24:**\n    *   Col 2 (`4`): Touches 2 (left).

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Process for Solving this ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The user wants me to crack an ARC task, given a few solved examples and a test input. I need to figure out the hidden logic behind the image transformations. Here's a breakdown of my thinking:\n\n1.  **Initial Scan & Feature Extraction:** First, I'm looking at the dimensions of the images, the values, and the colours. Quickly noting any obvious differences between the inputs and outputs (like the input and output sizes are the same). The main thing I'm noticing is the colour that seems to be acting as a \"separator\" or \"wall\" between other patterns and the images seem to be of the same size.\n2.  **Example 1 Deep Dive:** This is a 16x16 grid where one colour (I'll call it the *wall* colour, often number 8 in the first example) is the separator. Inside, a shape of one colour is present, with colours on either side. My intuition tells me that the \"wall\" colour is somehow being replaced or altered.\n    *   I looked at the shapes of the coloured blocks, their position relative to the \"wall\" and I'm seeing an obvious rule - the \"wall\" is being replaced, and what is *outside* the wall is, in some way, influencing the area. It looks like the wall colour is being removed and replaced by the neighbouring colours.\n    *   I'm verifying if it's based on repetition, pattern filling, or is it more like a slide or overlap?\n\n3.  **Example 2 Analysis:** I'm moving on to this new grid, it introduces a \"5\" wall, but its behaviour is slightly different in that the result isn't a simple removal of the \"wall\" colour. It seems the inner colours are propagating or moving over the barrier.\n    *   This is leading me to think in terms of a shape, with the wall colour being a boundary or occluding element, and the rest is being stitched together.\n    *   The 5's aren't removed, they're merged with the pattern, implying something more complex.\n\n4.  **Hypotheses Formation & Testing:**\n    *   **Hypothesis 1 (Folding/Unfolding):** My first instinct is about folding. The \"wall\" is a crease, and the image is bending along that crease. But the shape of the wall is irregular in Example 1, breaking the simple fold possibility.\n    *   **Hypothesis 2 (Sliding/Translation):** Could it be that components of the image are sliding past the wall and merging? The wall is a mask, and the rule is about how one side \"bumps\" into the other and mixes. This seems like a better match for example 2.\n        *   Example 3: the images is simpler, with 7 as the \"wall\" and the shapes on either side are simpler.\n        *   Then I checked - is it a Left-Right combination? Where does each piece shift?\n    *   **Hypothesis 3 (\"Pattern Propagation\"):** Is the rule about how patterns, if present, overwrite the \"wall\" colour. The examples 1 and 2 don't have clear patterns, but a mix, while example 3 seems to suggest a \"pattern\" propagation - from the left to the right side of the image. The Test input - 3s on the Left, 6 on the Right, with a 4-wall in between, strengthens this thought.\n\n5.  **Refining with Test Input:** This is where I'm applying the hypothesis to a new dataset, making sure my rule works in all situations.\n    *   Now the Test Input has a 4-wall, and the images on the Left and Right don't have easy-to-detect patterns.\n    *   I am focusing on how these coloured areas \"fill in\" the 4s using vertical propagation or, more frequently, *horizontal* propagation from each side.\n    *   I'm seeing that, the colour with a more clear *pattern* or the *colour* with the pattern propagates into the \"Wall\".\n\n6.  **\"Dominant\" Region Concept** After reviewing examples, the rule seems to depend on the \"dominance\" between the two regions (Left and Right).\n    *   What determines dominance? In most examples, 2, 3 have a clear *pattern*. Then I check the Examples: Example 1, 2 and 3.\n    *   If a patterned or complex region (3s and 2s) is next to 4, this zone wins (becomes 2 or 3).\n    *   Then I apply this concept to the test input.\n\n7.  **Finalize\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n1.  **Identify the \"Wall\"**: There is a specific color acting as a separator or \"wall\" (8 in Ex 1, 5 in Ex 2, 7 in Ex 3, and 4 in the Test Input). The goal is to replace this wall color with colors from the adjacent regions.\n2.  **Dominance Rule**: When the wall separates two regions, the color from the \"Dominant\" region floods into the wall.\n    *   **Pattern/Texture > Flat/Background**: Regions with complex patterns or specific details (like the mixed 3s and 4s in Ex 1, or 2s and 1s in Ex 2) are dominant over flat, uniform regions (like the 0s in Ex 2 or the 6s in Ex 3 and Test Input).\n    *   **Outer > Inner**: In Example 1, the outer patterned region overwrites the wall bordering the inner region.\n    *   **Vertical Propagation**: If horizontal neighbors don't resolve the fill (e.g., at a corner or horizontal bar of the wall), the dominant pattern propagates vertically (as seen in Ex 1, Row 4, and inferred for the Test Input).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Wall Color**: 4.\n*   **Regions**:\n    *   **Left Side (Rows 0-9)**: Contains 3s mixed with 2s (Textured/Dominant).\n    *   **Right Side (Rows 0-9)**: Contains 6s (Flat/Recessive).\n    *   **Middle (Rows 10-20)**: Mostly 6s on both sides.\n    *   **Bottom Left (Rows 21-29)**: Contains 3s and 2s (Textured/Dominant).\n    *   **Bottom Right (Rows 21-29)**: Contains 2s (Textured/Dominant) and 6s.\n\n**Transformation Steps:**\n*   **Rows 0-9**: The wall at column 9 separates the Dominant Left (3s) and Recessive Right (6s). The 3s propagate rightward, replacing the 4s.\n*   **Row 10**: The wall forms a horizontal bar. The Dominant 3s from the top propagate down to fill the 4s.\n*   **Rows 11-20**: The wall 4s are surrounded by 6s. They are filled with 6s.\n*   **Row 21**: The 4s on the left (`4,4,4`) are filled with 6s from the top (since the 6s above are the only neighbor, and 4s form a block). The 4s on the right (separating 6 and 2) are filled with 2s (Dominant).\n*   **Row 22**: The block of 4s on the left separates 3s (Left) and 6s (Right). 3s are dominant, so 4s -> 3s. On the right, 4s separate 6s and 2s. 2s are dominant -> 2s.\n*   **Rows 23-25**: Similar logic. 4s adjacent to 3s/2s become 3s/2s. Note in Row 25, the leftmost 4s fill from the top pattern (`3,2,2`).\n*   **Rows 26-29**: The 4s separating 6s and 2s are filled with 2s.\n\nOutput Grid:\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,4,4,4,4\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2",

Junction areas (where paths from different sources meet) remain as the boundary color.\n\nFor the test input:\n- **Top-left source** (rows 0-8, cols 0-8): mostly 3s with some 2s \u2192 **3 dominant**\n- **Top-right source** (rows 4-5, cols 27-28): 2,3,2 pattern \u2192 **2 dominant**  \n- **Bottom-left source** (rows 22-24, cols 0-1): mostly 3s \u2192 **3 dominant**\n- **Bottom-right source** (rows 21-29, cols 15-29): mostly 2s \u2192 **2 dominant**\n\nTracing the boundary network:\n- Boundaries from top-left (col 9, row 9 area) \u2192 become **3**\n- Boundaries from top-right (cols 22-26, rows 3-10 area) \u2192 become **2**\n- Boundaries from bottom-left (col 2, 6, rows 16-25 area) \u2192 become **3**\n- Boundaries from bottom-right (col 12, 14, 16, rows 8-29 area) \u2192 become **2**\n- Junction area (rows 11-13, cols 7-14) \u2192 stay **4**\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,2,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,4,4,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,4,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nAcross the examples, one color acts like a *corridor/outline* that connects many places (Example1: `8`, Example2: `5`, Example3: `7`). The remaining colors form \u201cseed regions\u201d sitting next to this corridor color, while the most common color is the background and never changes.\n\n**Rule:**\n1. **Identify the background color** = the most frequent color in the grid. (It stays unchanged.)\n2. **Identify the corridor color** = the color that forms the connected \u201cnetwork\u201d being overwritten (it is not the background, and it is the one that gets replaced by other colors).\n3. Let **seed colors** be all colors that are **neither background nor corridor**.\n4. **Propagate seed colors into the corridor** using shortest-path distance **moving only through corridor cells** (4-neighbor moves).\n   - For each corridor cell, compute the minimum corridor-path distance to each seed color (equivalently: multi-source BFS starting from all seed-colored cells, but only entering corridor cells).\n   - Replace that corridor cell with the seed color that reaches it with **strictly smaller** distance than all others.\n   - If there is a **tie** for smallest distance (two different seed colors reach it equally fast), **leave it as the corridor color**.\n\n### Applying to the test grid\n- Background is `6` (dominant).\n- Corridor/outline network is `4`.\n- Seed colors are `{2, 3}`.\n- Fill all `4` cells by corridor-distance to nearest `2` vs nearest `3`, keeping `4` only where distances tie.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,2,3,2\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nAcross the examples, one color acts as a **\u201cbridge/mask\u201d** that gets partially replaced by two other \u201cendpoint\u201d colors:\n\n- There is a **background** color that stays unchanged (e.g., 9 in ex.1, 0 in ex.2, 8 in ex.3).\n- There is a **bridge color** (ex.1: 8, ex.2: 5, ex.3: 7) that forms connected corridors/regions.\n- Exactly **two other non-background colors** exist; they behave like **competing sources** (ex.1: 3 & 4, ex.2: 1 & 2, ex.3: 6 & 5).\n- The task fills the bridge region by deciding, for each bridge cell, **which source is closer** via paths that stay inside the bridge color.\n\nA robust way to reproduce the example outputs is:\n\n1. **Identify background** = most common color.\n2. **Identify bridge** = the remaining color that gets changed (the \u201ccorridor\u201d color).\n3. The remaining two colors are the **source colors**.\n4. To avoid small noisy components influencing the fill (as seen in ex.2), use the **largest connected component** of each source color as the true source region.\n5. Consider the graph of cells of the bridge color (4-neighbor connections).\n6. For every bridge cell, compute:\n   - \\(d_A\\): shortest path length *through bridge cells only* to any bridge cell adjacent to the largest component of source color A.\n   - \\(d_B\\): same for source color B.\n7. Replace the bridge cell by:\n   - source color A if \\(d_A < d_B\\)\n   - source color B if \\(d_B < d_A\\)\n   - keep the bridge color if \\(d_A = d_B\\) (ties remain as the divider)\n\n### Applying to the test\n\n- Background is **6** (dominant).\n- Bridge color is **4**.\n- The two source colors are **3** and **2**.\n- Largest 3-component is the big cluster in the upper-left; largest 2-component is the big cluster in the lower-right.\n- Filling the connected 4-network by shortest-path distance produces almost all 4\u2019s turning into 3 on the \u201cupper/left\u201d side and into 2 on the \u201clower/right\u201d side, with a small tie line (remaining 4s) around the central meeting area.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3\n2,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,2,3,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,3,3,3,3\n2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,3,3,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,4,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n3,2,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2\n3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2",
