        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Thoughts**\n\nAlright, I've got this ARC task. The user wants me to crack a puzzle based on a few examples. Let's dig in. Seems like I'm given some input grids, some output grids, and I need to figure out the transformation. I suspect there's a geometric or logical operation in play.\n\n**Analyzing the Examples**\n\nOkay, first things first, let's look at these examples.  They're all 20x20 input grids, resulting in smaller output grids. Example 1 goes to 13x13, Example 2 and 3 go to 10x10. The inputs have black spaces (0) and some colorful shapes, like regions of repeating numbers or patterns. The outputs appear to be cropped or somehow *derived* from those colored structures in the input. Perhaps an important region is extracted.\n\n**Detailed Example Analysis**\n\nFor Example 1, I see this big green rectangle and some interior patterns made of teal and magenta pixels. The output is 13x13. It contains a lot of the structure inside the big green region (which is rows 0-11, and cols 7-17, approximately). In Example 2, there are grey, green, and yellow pixels. The output seems to show a cleaner version of some repeating pattern, like a \"5,0,5\" pattern appearing in rows and columns. In Example 3, there's a pattern, too, with what looks like checkerboard of 4s and other structures.  In the outputs, there seems to be a lot of cleaning up happening, maybe by removing some background noise or by extracting some structure.\n\nIn Example 1, the green structure is in the top-left area. It looks like the main shape. The output might involve scaling, rotation, or composition but there's \"noise\" too. The output might be a corrected version of the initial structure, or maybe an assemble operation? In Example 2, this is easier to recognize: The 10x10 output *seems* like rows from the input are used but they are scattered? It's like parts of input rows have been moved around to create output rows. There seem to be multiple objects.\n\nI'm starting to think about this in terms of \"main object\", \"background\", and \"noise\".  And maybe how these elements are overlaid or combined. The main thing that sticks out is these \"other\" pixels, these outlier pixels. Are these *moved* into the main block?\n\n**Hypothesis Building**\n\nOkay, I've got some ideas now.  Maybe it's a matter of identifying the \"main object\" in the input and then somehow correcting it or extracting it. Maybe the scattered bits represent pieces to be assembled onto this structure. My hypotheses:\n\n1.  **Background + Overlay:** There's a background (all 0s, maybe), and the main object is laid on top. Maybe there's also a \"correction\" process using these scattered pixels.\n\n2.  **Symmetry/Completion:** The output might be a *completed* or repaired version of a damaged input object, using the surrounding scattered elements.\n\n3.  **Coordinate Mapping:** Maybe there's a mathematical transformation, like modulo arithmetic, that maps input coordinates to output coordinates.\n\n4.  **Overlapping Layers:** Is the input a superposition of several grids, with maybe different shifts? This will depend on the output size and how to calculate it.\n\n5.  **Move Elements/Displacement:** It looks like this is a \"scrambled image\" where pixels (or maybe small blocks) have been shifted around, and I need to figure out where they go. How do you find the pattern of displacement? Is it just a constant offset?\n\n**Deeper Analysis of Example 2**\n\nIt looks like the 10x10 output in Example 2 is made from input elements in different locations. Row 0 of the output corresponds to the pattern at input (2,6) with the repeating 5s, zeros, and maybe 3's and 4's. But what about all the scattered pixels? Is there a shift? Is there a particular order for the shift?  Input (15,1) has a single 3, Output has no single 3 in that position. Maybe that stray pixel is supposed to fill a missing spot? If this is true, then I need to determine the translation vector, or a pattern of displacements. The outlier has a location. So does the \"hole\" in the main structure.\n\n**Visual Pattern Recognition**\n\nI'm thinking of it like a visual puzzle now.  There's this main structure - maybe it's a damaged or incomplete version of something, or just an image cut out of some larger picture. And there are some stray parts\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid into the output grid based on the pattern established by the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** The input is a $20 \\times 20$ grid containing a large $13 \\times 13$ structure (a green border with internal details) and some scattered \"stray\" pieces (teal 8, magenta 6). The output is a $13 \\times 13$ grid that corresponds to the large structure, but modified. The stray pieces from the input seem to be incorporated into the main structure in the output.\n2.  **Example 2:** Input is $20 \\times 20$, Output is $10 \\times 10$. The input has a main $10 \\times 10$ block of data and some isolated pieces (3, 4). The output is the $10 \\times 10$ block with the isolated pieces filled into specific positions. By observing the position of a unique anchor piece (the `4`), we can determine a translation vector that moves the stray pieces into the main block.\n3.  **Example 3:** Input is $20 \\times 20$, Output is $10 \\times 10$. Similar pattern: a main block at the bottom and scattered pieces at the top. The output is the superposition of the stray pieces onto the main block.\n\n**Strategy for Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify the Main Block:** In the test input ($20 \\times 20$), there is a large, distinct structure in the bottom-right area. It spans from Row 6 to Row 18, and Column 7 to Column 19. This gives it dimensions of $13 \\times 13$.\n    *   Top-Left of Main Block: $(6, 7)$\n    *   Bottom-Right of Main Block: $(18, 19)$\n2.  **Identify the Stray Block:** There is a cluster of pieces in the top-left area, separate from the main block. It is roughly bounded by $(0,0)$ to $(4,7)$.\n    *   Pieces include a vertical line of `5`s, some `3`s, and a `4`.\n3.  **Determine Translation Vector:** We need to find the correct offset to overlay the Stray Block onto the Main Block.\n    *   Stray piece at $(1, 7)$ is a yellow `4`.\n    *   In the Main Block, there is a yellow `4` at $(12, 13)$.\n    *   Assuming these represent the same feature, the shift vector is:\n        *   $\\Delta r = 12 - 1 = +11$\n        *   $\\Delta c = 13 - 7 = +6$\n4.  **Perform Overlay:**\n    *   Initialize the Output Grid as the $13 \\times 13$ Main Block (Input rows 6-18, cols 7-19).\n    *   Apply the Stray pieces using the shift $(+11, +6)$. If a stray pixel is non-zero, it overwrites the value in the Main Block.\n\n**Applying the Transformation:**\n*   **Stray pieces to move:**\n    *   (0, 4) `5` $\\to$ Main Block $(11, 10)$. Relative to block: $(5, 3)$.\n    *   (1, 4) `5` $\\to$ Main Block $(12, 10)$. Relative to block: $(6, 3)$.\n    *   (1, 7) `4` $\\to$ Main Block $(12, 13)$. Relative to block: $(6, 6)$. (Matches existing 4).\n    *   (2, 1) `3` $\\to$ Main Block $(13, 7)$. Relative to block: $(7, 0)$.\n    *   (2, 2) `3` $\\to$ Main Block $(13, 8)$. Relative to block: $(7, 1)$.\n    *   (2, 4) `5` $\\to$ Main Block $(13, 10)$. Relative to block: $(7, 3)$.\n    *   (3, 4) `5` $\\to$ Main Block $(14, 10)$. Relative to block: $(8, 3)$.\n    *   (4, 4) `5` $\\to$ Main Block $(15, 10)$. Relative to block: $(9, 3)$.\n\n**Constructing the Result:**\nWe extract the $13 \\times 13$ crop and apply the changes.\n*   **Row 5** (Input Row 11): Original at col 3 (Input col 10) is 0. Becomes 5.\n*   **Row 6** (Input Row 12): Original at col 3 (Input col 10) is 3. Becomes 5. Original at col 6 is 4 (Matches).\n*   **Row 7** (Input Row 13): Original at col 0, 1 (Input cols 7, 8) are 0. Become 3. Original at col 3 (Input col 10) is 0. Becomes 5.\n*   **Row 8** (Input Row 14): Original at col 3 (Input col 10) is 3. Becomes 5.\n*   **Row 9** (Input Row 15): Original at col 3 (Input col 10) is 0. Becomes 5.\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5\n0,0,0,5,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5\n5,5,0,5,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5\n3,3,0,5,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5\n5,5,0,5,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5\n0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Process for Solving this ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I have to figure out a transformation based on a few examples and a test case.  My initial thought is to dive right in and start analyzing, looking for patterns and rules. The task seems to involve cropping and then some kind of operation, probably rotation or flipping.\n\n**Example 1: Initial Investigation**\n\nI begin by examining the first example. I start by figuring out the grid size and notice a big area of black or zeros. I see a noticeable shape made up of greens, some kind of rectangle with patterns inside. I try to pinpoint the upper-left corner of this shape and trace the border. As I move around the image, I try to identify the main object, which appears to be a rectangle with some internal details.  I trace the rectangle to find its exact borders (rows 1-11, cols 7-17). The dimensions are 11x11, but the output is 13x13... that is a clue! I check pixel by pixel. I suspect the output might be the main object, extracted and possibly padded. Then I check for patterns, noise and isolate small groups outside the main block. I find some noise pixels, but I'm unsure if it matters. In my mind, I create a hypothesis that the output is a slightly larger crop around the main object. I define the crop window, assuming a 1-pixel margin, and check the pixel values within this extended area.  I notice a mismatch with the output row. I get confused by the rotation and flip and check the corners.  This leads me to the idea of a rotation and I check pixels and I'm led to think there is a 90 degrees rotation. Now, I try to understand how exactly the input is being transformed.\n\n**Example 2: Discovering the Transpose**\n\nI move on to the second example, and I'm already expecting rotation, flip, or something similar. I start the process all over again. I find the rectangle in Example 2. After getting stuck, I compare the output and input to look for direct pixel relationships. The 90 degrees hypothesis is rejected. I try 90 CCW, then I realize it's a Transpose (swap rows/cols). After a bit of struggle and some careful comparison of row/column elements, I confirm the transformation is indeed a transpose of the main object.\n\n**Revisiting Example 1: Confirming the Rotation**\n\nI go back to Example 1, wondering if it's also a transpose, but quickly realize it's not. I reconfirm it's a 90-degree clockwise rotation. Now I'm trying to figure out what dictates which transformation is used. I look for something different between the examples.\n\n**Hypothesis: Indicators and Transformations**\n\nI have a hypothesis: are these transformations linked to indicators somewhere in the images? I start looking at \"noise\" pixels outside the main blocks. I note colors of pixels outside of the blocks, the shapes formed by these noise pixels, and if these have any significance. I consider colors, shapes, and positions of noise pixels. I notice the different colors and shapes of the noise.\n\n**Testing the Indicator Hypothesis**\n\nI look at the test input and I can't quite identify an underlying rule. I also try to see if the colors of the frames of the shapes are important (but I reject this). I come up with the theory that the type of shape is tied to a transformation (but I end up stuck).\n\n**Revised Strategy: Combining Noise & Color**\n\nI look again at the Test Input, which has a vertical line of 5s on the left. The idea hits me: the vertical line of 5s suggests a \"Vertical\" orientation or \"Rotate to Vertical.\" I try a new hypothesis: Horizontal lines, rotate 0 degrees, Vertical lines, rotate 90.\n\n**Test Input Transformation**\n\nI now focus on defining the main object (rows 10-14, cols 10-16. 7 x 7 block). I trace it, and then apply my findings from the examples. So my hypothesis now is that a rotation of 90 degrees is applied (Vertical line means Rotate 90 CW). Then I identify a crop of the central 3x3 square (and the extra bits) and then do the rotation. However, it seems odd because the brackets (5's) are also part of the input, and I'm not sure if the margin is included.\n\n**Fine-tuning the Cropping**\n\nI debate whether or not to include the 5s in the object, eventually, I think the 5s might be an integral part of the cropping region. I figure out the bounding box and apply 90 degree rotation. My output\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the test input based on the pattern inferred from three solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains a large 11x11 \"frame\" of green (3) pixels with internal colored patterns. Outside this frame, there is a vertical bar of two teal (8) pixels on the left (rows 16-17).\n    *   **Output:** A 13x13 grid which corresponds to the main object (including a 1-pixel margin) rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n    *   **Inference:** The vertical noise (8s) acts as an instruction to **Rotate 90 degrees Clockwise**. The object is the main connected block plus its immediate surroundings.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains a 10x10 block of gray (5) and green (3) pixels. Outside, there are scattered single pixels (diagonal relation?).\n    *   **Output:** A 10x10 grid which corresponds to the main object **Transposed** (rows become columns).\n    *   **Inference:** The specific configuration of external pixels implies a Transpose operation.\n\n3.  **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains a 10x10 pattern of yellow (4) pixels. Outside, there is a horizontal bar of three blue (1) pixels.\n    *   **Output:** A 10x10 grid which is identical to the main object (shifted/cropped).\n    *   **Inference:** The horizontal noise (1s) acts as an instruction for **Identity** (0 degrees rotation).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Indicators:** The input contains a prominent **vertical line of five gray (5) pixels** in the top-left area (rows 0-4, column 4). Based on Example 1 (vertical indicator -> Rotate 90 CW), the transformation is **Rotate 90 degrees Clockwise**.\n*   **Object:** The main content is located in the middle-right. It consists of a central shape made of green (3) and yellow (4) pixels, bracketed by gray (5) pixels on the left (cols 7-8) and right (cols 18-19).\n    *   The vertical span of the object (including the attached pixels at row 9 and 15) is Row 9 to Row 15.\n    *   The horizontal span (including the 5-brackets) is Column 7 to Column 19.\n    *   Dimensions of the crop area: Height 7 (rows 9-15), Width 13 (cols 7-19).\n*   **Transformation:** Rotate the 7x13 crop by 90 degrees clockwise.\n    *   New Height = Old Width = 13.\n    *   New Width = Old Height = 7.\n    *   Map: New(row, col) = Old(15 - col, 7 + row) ? No, standard rotation formula.\n    *   New(r, c) = Old(bottom - c, left + r).\n        *   New Row `r` comes from Old Column `left + r` (read from bottom to top).\n        *   New Column `c` comes from Old Row `bottom - c`.\n\n**Constructing the Output (13x7):**\n\n*   **Row 0** (from Col 7, bottom-to-top): `0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0`\n*   **Row 1** (from Col 8, bottom-to-top): `0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0`\n*   **Row 2** (from Col 9, bottom-to-top): `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`\n*   **Row 3** (from Col 10, bottom-to-top): `0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0`\n*   **Row 4** (from Col 11, bottom-to-top): `0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0`\n*   **Row 5** (from Col 12, bottom-to-top): `0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3`\n*   **Row 6** (from Col 13, bottom-to-top): `0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 3, 3`\n*   **Row 7** (from Col 14, bottom-to-top): `3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0`\n*   **Row 8** (from Col 15, bottom-to-top): `0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0`\n*   **Row 9** (from Col 16, bottom-to-top): `0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0`\n*   **Row 10** (from Col 17, bottom-to-top): `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`\n*   **Row 11** (from Col 18, bottom-to-top): `0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0`\n*   **Row 12** (from Col 19, bottom-to-top): `0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0`\n\n0,5,0,5,0,5,0\n0,5,0,5,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,3,0,3,0\n0,3,3,3,3,3,0\n0,3,0,0,0,3,3\n0,3,0,4,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,3,0\n0,3,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,3,3,3,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,5,5,5,0\n0,5,5,5,5,5,0",

Consider all **non-zero cells** as foreground, regardless of their specific color.\n3. Group foreground cells into **8-connected components** (cells touching by side *or corner* belong to the same component).  \n   - This matches Example 3, where a checkerboard-like pattern is only connected diagonally, so 8-connectivity is required.\n4. Select the **largest** such connected component.\n5. Compute its **tight bounding box** (min/max row and min/max column covering that component).\n6. **Crop** the input grid to that bounding box and output the cropped subgrid (keeping any zeros or other colors that happen to lie inside the box).\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\nThe largest 8-connected component is the big cluster of `3`s in the lower-middle area. Its bounding box spans:\n- rows **9 to 15**\n- columns **10 to 16**\n\nCropping to that rectangle gives the output below.\n\n### Output grid\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,0  \n0,3,0,0,0,3,3  \n3,3,0,4,0,3,3  \n0,3,0,0,0,3,3  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,0  \n0,0,0,0,3,0,0",
