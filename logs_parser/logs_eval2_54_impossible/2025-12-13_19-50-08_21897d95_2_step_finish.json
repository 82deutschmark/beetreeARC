The core challenge is deciphering the transformation rules based on provided examples and a single test input. It's a bit like playing detective and applying a set of arcane rules, and verifying that what I think is correct actually works. The input data, in essence, is a set of 2D grids, in which I must deduce the underlying logic and apply it.  I'm given sample inputs and outputs which will be used to understand the rules. The description also mentions 'objects description' and 'transformation description' which are important information to look at.\n\n**Rule Extraction and Pattern Recognition**\n\nIt looks like the key is to interpret the description, verify this interpretation with the examples, and build an understanding. The description mentions finding 'T-shaped patterns', using them as arrows to affect neighbors, and handling corner shapes for rotation.  I need to break this down. The grid's elements are integers which, in the context, refer to 'colors.' The 3x3 T-shaped patterns seem central.  I'll start by looking for those patterns in the examples.\n\n**Verification Through Examples**\n\nLet's test this description with the first example. Examining the input grid, the T-shape is apparent, and the corresponding change in the output grid supports the idea of an arrow-based recoloring.  The arrow seems to point to a background-colored area, which is then replaced by the color that's at the center of the T. The tricky aspect is the \"direction\" of the T-shape and the \"payload\" color.  By studying example 1, it's possible to infer that I must identify the 'stem' of the T-shape, that is the most distinct side, and that the \"payload\" is the color in the center of the pattern.\n\n**Understanding Rotation and Border Cases**\n\nExample 1 also involves grid rotation, and the description of an L-shaped corner is the \"trigger\". I must analyze the output and correlate it with the corner's original position. Example 2's structure looks similar to example 1, but doesn't require rotation, so I should see what the logic is there. With some work, I can isolate the crucial characteristics for the rotation decisions.\n\n**Applying Rules to the Test Input**\n\nI'm now armed with a more detailed set of rules. For the test input, I will first identify the regions and extract the color boundaries of the grid. From there, I will look for patterns (the cross-like shapes). Each pattern has an \"arrow\", pointing to a neighbor region and changing the color of that region. I need to note where the regions connect. Additionally, I need to evaluate the rotation, and see where the L-shape can be located and where the output should be placed on the grid.\n\n**Iterative Refinement and Double-Checking**\n\nThe main plan is to map out the connections, identify regions, pattern actions, any required rotation. I will keep checking the \"state\" of the grid (what colors, where) at each step. This also means identifying which colors will change to other colors. Finally, after I think I have the rules, it's crucial to double-check my work. Does the color map make sense? Are all patterns and transformations accounted for?\n\n**Final Solution Generation**\n\nWith the rules in place, the steps will be:\n*   Parse the input.\n*   Identify background regions.\n*   Find each T-shape and store the details (center, orientation).\n*   Perform the color-change of neighbor regions.\n*   Perform all rotations (if required).\n*   Output the transformed grid.\n\nThis should lead to the correct output, according to the rules.\n\nBased on the patterns and the rules I've interpreted, I will now create an output grid and map the changes to it.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of colored tiles containing \"arrow\" patterns and \"L-shaped\" corner markers. Based on the provided examples and descriptions, here is the breakdown of the logic:\n\n### 1. Identify Background Regions\nFirst, we decompose the input grid into solid rectangular regions of background color.\nFor the **Test Input (24x24)**, we identifying the following regions (ignoring the small embedded patterns):\n- **Region R1 (Top Strip):** Rows 0\u20133, spanning the full width (Cols 0\u201323). Color: **5**.\n- **Region R2 (Middle Left):** Rows 4\u201319, Cols 0\u20135. Color: **3**.\n- **Region R3 (Middle Center):** Rows 4\u201315, Cols 6\u201317. Color: **8**.\n- **Region R4 (Middle Right):** Rows 4\u201319, Cols 18\u201323. Color: **6**.\n- **Region R5 (Bottom Center):** Rows 16\u201319, Cols 6\u201317 (located below R3). Color: **4**.\n- **Region R6 (Bottom Strip):** Rows 20\u201323, spanning the full width (Cols 0\u201323). Color: **2**.\n\n### 2. Analyze Embedded Patterns & Apply Transformation\nWe look for 3x3 \"T-shaped\" or \"Cross-minus-one-arm\" patterns. The missing arm indicates the direction the \"arrow\" is pointing (e.g., Missing Left $\\rightarrow$ Points Right). The arrow dictates a recoloring of the neighbor region in that direction.\n- **Payload Rule:** If the pattern's center pixel is `1`, the payload is the background color of the region containing the pattern. Otherwise, the payload is the color of the center pixel itself.\n\n**Pattern Analysis for Test Input:**\n1.  **In R1 (Top, Color 5):** Pattern at `(2,21)`. Center `1`, surrounded by `1`s, top is background. Missing Top $\\rightarrow$ Points **Down**.\n    -   Target: Region R4 (Right strip, below R1 at this column).\n    -   Payload: Center is `1`, so payload is R1's color (**5**).\n    -   **Result:** **R4 becomes 5.**\n2.  **In R2 (Left, Color 3):** Pattern at `(5,2)`. Center `1`. Missing Bottom $\\rightarrow$ Points **Up**.\n    -   Target: Region R1 (Top strip).\n    -   Payload: Center is `1`, so payload is R2's color (**3**).\n    -   **Result:** **R1 becomes 3.**\n3.  **In R4 (Right, Color 6):** Pattern at `(18,21)`. Center `1`. Missing Top $\\rightarrow$ Points **Down**.\n    -   Target: Region R6 (Bottom strip).\n    -   Payload: Center is `1`, so payload is R4's color (**6**).\n    -   **Result:** **R6 becomes 6.**\n4.  **In R6 (Bottom, Color 2):** Pattern at `(21,2)`. Center `1`. Missing Bottom $\\rightarrow$ Points **Up**.\n    -   Target: Region R2 (Left strip).\n    -   Payload: Center is `1`, so payload is R6's color (**2**).\n    -   **Result:** **R2 becomes 2.**\n5.  **In R3 (Center, Color 8):** Pattern at `(14,8)`. Center is **7**. Neighbors are `1`. Missing Top $\\rightarrow$ Points **Down**.\n    -   Target: Region R5 (Bottom Center).\n    -   Payload: Center is **7** (not 1), so payload is **7**.\n    -   **Result:** **R5 becomes 7.**\n6.  **In R5 (Bottom Center, Color 4):** Pattern at `(18,12)`. Center `1`. Missing Bottom $\\rightarrow$ Points **Up**.\n    -   Target: Region R3 (Center).\n    -   Payload: Center is `1`, so payload is R5's color (**4**).\n    -   **Result:** **R3 becomes 4.**\n\n### 3. Rotation Logic\nWe look for an \"L-shaped\" corner pattern to determine grid rotation.\n-   **Pattern Found:** In Region R3, rows 6\u20138, cols 9\u201311, there is a formation of **9**s forming an L-shape (Top bar and Right vertical).\n-   **Position:** This pattern is located in the top-left quadrant of the grid `(6,9)`.\n-   **Rule:** Rotate the grid so the pattern is in the Top-Left. Since it is already in the Top-Left quadrant, the rotation required is **0 degrees**.\n\n### 4. Construct Final Grid\nWe reconstruct the grid using the region boundaries and their new colors:\n-   **R1 (Top, 0-3):** **3**\n-   **R2 (Left, 4-19):** **2**\n-   **R3 (Center, 4-15):** **4**\n-   **R4 (Right, 4-19):** **5**\n-   **R5 (Bottom Ctr, 16-19):** **7**\n-   **R6 (Bottom, 20-23):** **6**\n\n**Output Grid Layout:**\n-   **Rows 0\u20133:** All cells **3**.\n-   **Rows 4\u201315:** Cols 0\u20135 are **2**, Cols 6\u201317 are **4**, Cols 18\u201323 are **5**.\n-   **Rows 16\u201319:** Cols 0\u20135 are **2**, Cols 6\u201317 are **7**, Cols 18\u201323 are **5**.\n-   **Rows 20\u201323:** All cells **6**.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_11_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n### Inferred rule (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **The grid is tiled by large solid background rectangles.**  \n   Inside some rectangles there are small 3\u00d73 \u201cembedded patterns\u201d made mostly of color **1**.\n\n2. **Detect \u201cT\u201d patterns (a plus-shape missing one arm).**  \n   A T consists of a center cell plus **three** orthogonal neighbors that are **1** (the missing side is the direction *opposite* the stem).  \n   The **stem direction** (the single arm that is not paired with an opposite arm) gives an **arrow direction**.\n\n3. **Compute the payload color** for that arrow:\n   - If the **center \u2260 1**, payload = center color.\n   - If the **center = 1**, payload = the **background color of the rectangle containing the T**.\n\n4. **Shoot the arrow** from the T\u2019s center in the stem direction until leaving its rectangle;

These recolor the big 6/7/4/8 territories into {0,3,7}. Use the visible 9 L-shape as orientation marker to pick the correct 90\u00b0 rotation (dimensions swap).\n- Observation: Official output is a rotated/condensed territory-fill with only 0/3/7, consistent with whole-territory repainting and marker removal.\n- Verdict: Pass.\n\nExample 2\n- Hypothesis: Identify multiple T-arrows: (1,6)-style all-1 arrow sends background 7 \u2192 right territory; center=6 arrow sends 6 \u2192 7-territory; center=9 arrow sends 9 \u2192 5-territory; plus reciprocal 8\u21943 repaint via 1-centered arrows. Fill territories uniformly.\n- Observation: Official output shows exactly those whole-territory recolors (top becomes 6, right becomes 7, bottom middle becomes 9, etc.) with markers removed.\n- Verdict: Pass.\n\nExample 3\n- Hypothesis: T-arrows recolor major territories (6\u21923, 3\u21924, upper-4\u21926, bottom-4\u21927) while 5 and 8 stay; then a 90\u00b0 rotation direction is chosen via the 9 L-marker placement, producing a 9x14 output.\n- Observation: Official output matches whole-territory repainting to {5,3,7,8,6,4} with the expected rotated layout.\n- Verdict: Pass.\n\nExample 4\n- Hypothesis: Multiple all-1 T-arrows cause a cycle of territory recolors (2\u2192right, 6\u2192top-left, 3\u2192middle, 6\u2192bottom-left).

Each contains a T-arrow whose payload is either the territory color (center=1) or the explicit center color (center=7).

<ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the task is clear: solve an ARC problem involving abstract reasoning and 2D grid manipulation.  The core challenge is deciphering the transformation rules based on provided examples and a single test input. It's a bit like playing detective and applying a set of arcane rules, and verifying that what I think is correct actually works. The input data, in essence, is a set of 2D grids, in which I must deduce the underlying logic and apply it.  I'm given sample inputs and outputs which will be used to understand the rules. The description also mentions 'objects description' and 'transformation description' which are important information to look at.\n\n**Rule Extraction and Pattern Recognition**\n\nIt looks like the key is to interpret the description, verify this interpretation with the examples, and build an understanding. The description mentions finding 'T-shaped patterns', using them as arrows to affect neighbors, and handling corner shapes for rotation.  I need to break this down. The grid's elements are integers which, in the context, refer to 'colors.' The 3x3 T-shaped patterns seem central.  I'll start by looking for those patterns in the examples.\n\n**Verification Through Examples**\n\nLet's test this description with the first example. Examining the input grid, the T-shape is apparent, and the corresponding change in the output grid supports the idea of an arrow-based recoloring.  The arrow seems to point to a background-colored area, which is then replaced by the color that's at the center of the T. The tricky aspect is the \"direction\" of the T-shape and the \"payload\" color.  By studying example 1, it's possible to infer that I must identify the 'stem' of the T-shape, that is the most distinct side, and that the \"payload\" is the color in the center of the pattern.\n\n**Understanding Rotation and Border Cases**\n\nExample 1 also involves grid rotation, and the description of an L-shaped corner is the \"trigger\". I must analyze the output and correlate it with the corner's original position. Example 2's structure looks similar to example 1, but doesn't require rotation, so I should see what the logic is there. With some work, I can isolate the crucial characteristics for the rotation decisions.\n\n**Applying Rules to the Test Input**\n\nI'm now armed with a more detailed set of rules. For the test input, I will first identify the regions and extract the color boundaries of the grid. From there, I will look for patterns (the cross-like shapes). Each pattern has an \"arrow\", pointing to a neighbor region and changing the color of that region. I need to note where the regions connect. Additionally, I need to evaluate the rotation, and see where the L-shape can be located and where the output should be placed on the grid.\n\n**Iterative Refinement and Double-Checking**\n\nThe main plan is to map out the connections, identify regions, pattern actions, any required rotation. I will keep checking the \"state\" of the grid (what colors, where) at each step. This also means identifying which colors will change to other colors. Finally, after I think I have the rules, it's crucial to double-check my work. Does the color map make sense? Are all patterns and transformations accounted for?\n\n**Final Solution Generation**\n\nWith the rules in place, the steps will be:\n*   Parse the input.\n*   Identify background regions.\n*   Find each T-shape and store the details (center, orientation).\n*   Perform the color-change of neighbor regions.\n*   Perform all rotations (if required).\n*   Output the transformed grid.\n\nThis should lead to the correct output, according to the rules.\n\nBased on the patterns and the rules I've interpreted, I will now create an output grid and map the changes to it.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of colored tiles containing \"arrow\" patterns and \"L-shaped\" corner markers. Based on the provided examples and descriptions, here is the breakdown of the logic:\n\n### 1. Identify Background Regions\nFirst, we decompose the input grid into solid rectangular regions of background color.\nFor the **Test Input (24x24)**, we identifying the following regions (ignoring the small embedded patterns):\n- **Region R1 (Top Strip):** Rows 0\u20133, spanning the full width (Cols 0\u201323). Color: **5**.\n- **Region R2 (Middle Left):** Rows 4\u201319, Cols 0\u20135. Color: **3**.\n- **Region R3 (Middle Center):** Rows 4\u201315, Cols 6\u201317. Color: **8**.\n- **Region R4 (Middle Right):** Rows 4\u201319, Cols 18\u201323. Color: **6**.\n- **Region R5 (Bottom Center):** Rows 16\u201319, Cols 6\u201317 (located below R3). Color: **4**.\n- **Region R6 (Bottom Strip):** Rows 20\u201323, spanning the full width (Cols 0\u201323). Color: **2**.\n\n### 2. Analyze Embedded Patterns & Apply Transformation\nWe look for 3x3 \"T-shaped\" or \"Cross-minus-one-arm\" patterns. The missing arm indicates the direction the \"arrow\" is pointing (e.g., Missing Left $\\rightarrow$ Points Right). The arrow dictates a recoloring of the neighbor region in that direction.\n- **Payload Rule:** If the pattern's center pixel is `1`, the payload is the background color of the region containing the pattern. Otherwise, the payload is the color of the center pixel itself.\n\n**Pattern Analysis for Test Input:**\n1.  **In R1 (Top, Color 5):** Pattern at `(2,21)`. Center `1`, surrounded by `1`s, top is background. Missing Top $\\rightarrow$ Points **Down**.\n    -   Target: Region R4 (Right strip, below R1 at this column).\n    -   Payload: Center is `1`, so payload is R1's color (**5**).\n    -   **Result:** **R4 becomes 5.**\n2.  **In R2 (Left, Color 3):** Pattern at `(5,2)`. Center `1`. Missing Bottom $\\rightarrow$ Points **Up**.\n    -   Target: Region R1 (Top strip).\n    -   Payload: Center is `1`, so payload is R2's color (**3**).\n    -   **Result:** **R1 becomes 3.**\n3.  **In R4 (Right, Color 6):** Pattern at `(18,21)`. Center `1`. Missing Top $\\rightarrow$ Points **Down**.\n    -   Target: Region R6 (Bottom strip).\n    -   Payload: Center is `1`, so payload is R4's color (**6**).\n    -   **Result:** **R6 becomes 6.**\n4.  **In R6 (Bottom, Color 2):** Pattern at `(21,2)`. Center `1`. Missing Bottom $\\rightarrow$ Points **Up**.\n    -   Target: Region R2 (Left strip).\n    -   Payload: Center is `1`, so payload is R6's color (**2**).\n    -   **Result:** **R2 becomes 2.**\n5.  **In R3 (Center, Color 8):** Pattern at `(14,8)`. Center is **7**. Neighbors are `1`. Missing Top $\\rightarrow$ Points **Down**.\n    -   Target: Region R5 (Bottom Center).\n    -   Payload: Center is **7** (not 1), so payload is **7**.\n    -   **Result:** **R5 becomes 7.**\n6.  **In R5 (Bottom Center, Color 4):** Pattern at `(18,12)`. Center `1`. Missing Bottom $\\rightarrow$ Points **Up**.\n    -   Target: Region R3 (Center).\n    -   Payload: Center is `1`, so payload is R5's color (**4**).\n    -   **Result:** **R3 becomes 4.**\n\n### 3. Rotation Logic\nWe look for an \"L-shaped\" corner pattern to determine grid rotation.\n-   **Pattern Found:** In Region R3, rows 6\u20138, cols 9\u201311, there is a formation of **9**s forming an L-shape (Top bar and Right vertical).\n-   **Position:** This pattern is located in the top-left quadrant of the grid `(6,9)`.\n-   **Rule:** Rotate the grid so the pattern is in the Top-Left. Since it is already in the Top-Left quadrant, the rotation required is **0 degrees**.\n\n### 4.

Each has exactly one arrow affecting it:\n\n- Left (3) block has an **up-arrow** \u2192 recolors the **top band** to **3**.\n- Bottom (2) band has an **up-arrow** \u2192 recolors the **left block** to **2**.\n- Top (5) band has a **down-arrow** \u2192 recolors the **right block** to **5**.\n- Right (6) block has a **down-arrow** \u2192 recolors the **bottom band** to **6**.\n- Lower-middle (4) block has an **up-arrow** \u2192 recolors the **upper-middle (8)** block to **4**.\n- Upper-middle (8) block contains an arrow whose bar-center is **7** (payload) pointing down \u2192 recolors the **lower-middle (4)** block to **7**.\n\nSo the final large-region recoloring is:\n\n- Top band \u2192 3  \n- Left block \u2192 2  \n- Upper-middle block \u2192 4  \n- Lower-middle block \u2192 7  \n- Right block \u2192 5  \n- Bottom band \u2192 6  \n\nThen we output these regions uniformly.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid (24\u00d724)\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,5,5,5,5,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"D\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation\n\n1. **Ignore the small dark-blue shapes (color 1) as \u201carrows/markers.\u201d**  \n   They never remain in the output;

Vertically-oriented regions (spanning full height) swap positions with each other.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\n- **5** (rows 0-3): Full-width top strip, has 1-pattern\n- **2** (rows 20-23): Full-width bottom strip, has 1-pattern  \n- **3** (rows 4-19, cols 0-5): Left strip, has 1-pattern\n- **6** (rows 4-19, cols 18-23): Right strip, has 1-pattern\n- **8** (rows 4-15, cols 6-17): Center block, has 1-pattern with **special cell 7** at (14,8)\n- **4** (rows 16-19, cols 6-17): Bottom-center block, has 1-pattern\n- **9** appears but NOT surrounded by 1s, so not a special cell\n\n**Transformation:**\n- 5 \u2194 2 swap (both horizontal strips)\n- 3 \u2194 6 swap (both vertical strips)\n- 8 \u2192 7 (special cell replacement)\n- 4 stays (has 1-pattern)\n\n**Output structure:**\n- Rows 0-3: 2 (all columns)\n- Rows 4-15: 6 (cols 0-5), 7 (cols 6-17), 3 (cols 18-23)\n- Rows 16-19: 6 (cols 0-5), 4 (cols 6-17), 3 (cols 18-23)\n- Rows 20-23: 5 (all columns)\n\n```\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3\n6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3\n6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3\n6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- SELECT THE BEST RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1. It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
