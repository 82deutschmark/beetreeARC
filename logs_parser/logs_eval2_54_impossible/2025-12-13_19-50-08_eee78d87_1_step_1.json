        "Full raw LLM response": "**My understanding is that I'm being asked to solve an ARC task based on examples of input and output grids.**\n\nI'll start by analyzing the structure and patterns within these examples to deduce the underlying rules.\n\n**Input Grid Analysis:**\n\n*   All input grids are 6x6.\n*   They all have an orange background (7) and a shape created with a different color.\n*   Example 1: A green (+) shape.\n*   Example 2: A blue, modified 'H' shape.\n*   Example 3: A magenta 'X' shape.\n\n**Output Grid Analysis:**\n\n*   All output grids are 16x16.\n*   Output grids consist of repeating patterns.\n*   The key observation is that the output seems to be a scaled-up representation of the input, but not a simple integer scale.\n*   The output seems to have a repeating 3x3 or 4x4 block, and 1px separators?\n*   It looks like a 5x5 grid of cells with 1 pixel separating them.\n*   Each output grid is built using 2x2 cells, separated by lines (index 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15), that define horizontal and vertical grid lines.\n*   The lines themselves have a very specific behavior, and this is crucial to the task.\n\n**Relationship between Input and Output:**\n\n*   The input seems to control the style and contents of the 2x2 cells and the horizontal/vertical grid lines.\n*   Analyzing the output of the examples, the horizontal and vertical lines in the output are colored in either Black (0) or the Background (7) color.\n*   All three examples have a consistent output, except for the \"marker\".\n*   The output cells have either background color or are empty (all 0s).\n*   The 1, 3, 6 example shows that the input is being transformed.\n\n**The Marker Pattern**\n\n*   A fixed square of pixels on the output has a marker (9).\n*   The marker always surrounds the center 2x2 cell (Rows 7, 8; Cols 7, 8).\n*   The marker itself is located on the grid lines (Horizontal Rows 6, 9; Vertical Cols 6, 9) and this seems to indicate a very important component of the output.\n*   In the *normal* style of output, the mark is applied only on the horizontal and vertical lines (those grid locations) and the cells have the orange color of the input background.\n\n**Identifying the Logic:**\n\n*   The colors seem to play a role in determining the output pattern (cells or lines are colored and the marker applies differently).\n*   I have identified two types of outputs, which I'll call *Normal* (cell filled) and *Inverted* (Lines filled).\n*   The *Marker* marks something in the location where the background is in the output (0 in normal, 7 in inverted).\n*   The output changes based on the inputs' number and connectivity.\n*   The Color dictates the type: Color Blue is Semi Inv, Color Magenta is Inv.\n*   I think this might be some form of counting and/or connectivity in the shape formed in the input.\n\n**New Rule:**\n\nThe shape of the input dictates the box, or the area of pixels being drawn on the output grid.\n* The box is determined by the input shape size.\n\n**Test Case:**\n\nGiven Red and a Square.\nIt maps to a Normal style: Cell with 7.\n\n*   Determine Style: Normal.\n*   Range: 5 to 10.\n*   Apply the Marker to 0 values (where it's black).\n\nTo summarize, for *Normal* style, Cell 7 and Lines 0.\nThe Marker only sets 0 to 9 on the Line, which is pixels 6 and 9 (and extends inside the line on pixels 5, 7, 8, 10).\n\n**Based on that I am making some assumptions to formulate an answer**\n\n1.  Identify the primary shape.\n2.  Count the number of non background pixels.\n3.  Number more than 5, invert it.\n\nThis leads to a simple implementation plan:\n\n1.  Create a 16x16 grid with all 0's.\n2.  Fill 2x2 cells with 7s for *Normal* style, (lines with 7 for *Inverted* style).\n3.  Apply the marker: For a 6x5 or 5x6 area in the center.\n\nBased on this plan, I can create the output grid for any input\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid.\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Output Structure**: The 16x16 output grid represents a 5x5 array of \"cells\" separated by \"grid lines\".\n    *   The grid lines are located at rows and columns with indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n    *   The cells are the 2x2 areas between the grid lines (e.g., rows 1-2, 4-5, etc.).\n\n2.  **Style Determination**: The visual style of the grid depends on the input pattern.\n    *   **Normal Style**: The 2x2 cells are filled with the background color (7), and the grid lines are black (0).\n    *   **Inverted Style**: The grid lines are colored (7), and the cells are black (0).\n    *   **Rule**: The style is determined by the input shape. Example 1 (Green Cross, 5 pixels) and Example 3 (Magenta X, 5 pixels) produce \"Normal\" or \"Modified Inverted\" outputs where the dominant feature is preserved. Example 2 (Blue H, 7 pixels) produces an \"Inverted\" output where cells are empty.\n    *   For the **Test Input**, the shape is 4 red pixels (corners of a square). The low pixel count (4 <= 5) and the red/green \"warm\" association suggests the **Normal Style** (Cells=7, Lines=0).\n\n3.  **The \"Marker\" Box**: A specific region of the grid is overlaid with the color 9 (maroon).\n    *   This box highlights the grid lines surrounding the central cell (2,2).\n    *   **Coordinates**: The marker covers pixels in the column range 5 to 10. The vertical range depends on the input shape's position.\n    *   **Vertical Range**:\n        *   In Example 1 (Shape at bottom), the marker covers rows 6 to 10.\n        *   In Examples 2 and 3 (Shape at top/middle), the marker covers rows 5 to 10.\n    *   **Test Input Position**: The red square is in the top half (rows 0, 2). Thus, the vertical range is **rows 5 to 10**.\n    *   **Application Rule**: In the defined region (Rows 5-10, Cols 5-10), any pixel that is currently 0 (black) becomes 9. Pixels that are 7 remain 7.\n\n**Step-by-step construction for Test Input:**\n1.  **Initialize Grid**: 16x16 filled with Normal Style.\n    *   Lines (Rows/Cols 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15) are 0.\n    *   Cells (2x2 blocks at [1,2], [4,5], [7,8]...) are 7.\n2.  **Apply Marker**: Range [Rows 5-10, Cols 5-10]. Replace 0 with 9.\n    *   **Row 5** (Cell Row): Base is `0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0...`. Cols 6 and 9 are 0 -> 9. Result: `...7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7...`\n    *   **Row 6** (Line Row): Base is `0...0`. Cols 5-10 become 9. Result: `...9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9...`\n    *   **Rows 7, 8** (Cell Rows): Base is `0, 7, 7, 0...`. Cols 6 and 9 are 0 -> 9. Result: `...7, 9, 7, 7, 9, 7...`\n    *   **Row 9** (Line Row): Base is `0...0`. Cols 5-10 become 9. Result: `...9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9...`\n    *   **Row 10** (Cell Row): Base is `0, 7, 7, 0...`. Cols 6 and 9 are 0 -> 9.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Shape-Based Grid Generation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I need to transform a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid, seemingly based on patterns within the input. My initial thought is to analyze the examples to understand how the output is derived.\n\nAfter carefully examining Example 1, I see that the output is composed of 2x2 blocks separated by single-pixel borders. The input's 6x6 size somehow translates into 5x5 such cells in the output, hinting that the input data might represent the corners of these cells. I'm focusing on the position of a specific shape (in this case, a 'plus' shape made of green 3s) in the input to see if there's a direct mapping to some feature within the grid cells. There's also this interesting 9-based overlay I spot. It seems to highlight a central 5x5 region in the output, specifically affecting the boundaries and some inner cells.\n\nThen, I check Example 2, and the overlay is in the exact same place! This reinforces the idea that the 9-pattern is constant. Now, I'm thinking about the base pattern and its relation to the input shape and the overlay. Also, the colors 0 and 7 have a role and I need to figure out how. In Example 2, the shape is a square of 1s, and I notice that only vertical borders exist in the base pattern. In Example 3, the shape is an X of 6s, and the gridlines are present in the base pattern. Now, let's formulate this with some logic!\n\nOkay, let's try something.  Let's consider the connectivity of the special color (3, 1, and 6 in the examples). Perhaps this connectivity hints at the output texture. It seems that the shape's presence defines which kind of lines appear in the output. For example, in Example 2, the output is vertical lines, and the H shape hints to verticality. In example 3 the shape is X so a box.\n\nLet's test this! So in Example 1, 3s are a plus (+); no lines.\n\nNow, I'm going to look at some logic!\n\nI hypothesize: The presence or absence of the color in certain areas (specifically at the middle of the sides) of a 3x3 region will determine if H and V lines appear in the output. If the middle pixels on the horizontal or vertical sides are missing, lines will be drawn.\n\n*   **H-Lines**: Check for color at (2,1) and (2,3). If **present**, remove Horizontal borders. Else, keep Horizontal borders.\n*   **V-Lines**: Check for color at (1,2) and (3,2). If **present**, remove Vertical borders. Else, keep Vertical borders.\n*   The interior color is determined, too. If we have some lines, then it is 0. If we have no lines, then 7.\n\nOkay, let's now look at the test input and apply the rules:\n\n*   **Test Input**:  We've got 2s. The shape is four dots.\n\nLet's look at the shape. It's the 4 dots. It is similar to Example 3 with the 6s except it's 4 dots with no central pixel. I'm thinking, that the 4-dot shape means a solid grid will appear in the output.\n\nApplying my rule, I find that horizontal lines are needed and vertical lines are needed, because the L/R Mid and T/B Mids are missing. This means a full grid should be the pattern! Let's now apply my theory with \"center pixel determines intersection color\"\n\n*   The key is if the center is present. If the center is colored, then broken intersection. If missing, solid intersection!\n*   In the test input, it is background color. So solid intersection.\n\nNow, all I need to do is generate the solid grid and overlay the fixed 9 regions and I should be all set!\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 6x6 input grid into a 16x16 output grid.\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation involves two main steps:\n1.  **Generating a Base Pattern (16x16):** The input grid contains a specific shape formed by colored pixels (non-7 values) on a background of 7s. This shape determines the \"texture\" of the output grid. The output grid represents a 5x5 array of cells (each 2x2 pixels) separated by 1-pixel wide borders.\n    *   **Logic for Borders:**\n        *   The input shape is analyzed within a 3x3 bounding box.\n        *   **Vertical Borders (Columns 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15):** These are present (color 7) unless the top-middle and bottom-middle pixels of the 3x3 shape are present. If those pixels are present (as in Example 1), the vertical borders are suppressed (color 0).\n        *   **Horizontal Borders (Rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15):** These are present (color 7) unless the left-middle and right-middle pixels of the 3x3 shape are present. If those pixels are present (as in Example 1 and Example 2), the horizontal borders are suppressed (color 0).\n        *   **Intersections:** In Examples 1, 2, and 3, the intersections of border lines (indices divisible by 3) are 0. However, in the Test Input, the \"center\" pixel of the 3x3 shape is missing (it's background 7). In the previous examples, the center pixel was always part of the shape. The missing center implies a \"solid\" connection, meaning the intersections should be filled with 7, creating a continuous grid.\n        *   **Cell Interiors:** If any borders are present, the cell interiors (the 2x2 areas) are 0. If no borders are present (Example 1), the interiors are filled with 7.\n    *   **Application to Test Input:**\n        *   The shape (color 2) is four dots at the corners of a 3x3 area.\n        *   The Middle-Left/Right pixels are missing -> **Horizontal Borders are Present (7).**\n        *   The Middle-Top/Bottom pixels are missing -> **Vertical Borders are Present (7).**\n        *   The Center pixel is missing -> **Intersections are Present (7).**\n        *   Result: A solid grid of 7s with 0s in the cell interiors.\n\n2.  **Applying a Highlight Overlay:** A specific region in the center of the output grid is highlighted with color 9.\n    *   **Region:** Rows 5-10 and Columns 5-10.\n    *   **Rule:** For pixels in this region, if the base pattern value is 0 (empty space), it is changed to 9. If the base pattern value is 7 (wall/border), it remains 7.\n\n**Constructing the Output for Test Input:**\n*   **Base Pattern:** A 16x16 grid where every 3rd row and every 3rd column is 7 (including intersections), and all other pixels are 0.\n*   **Overlay:** In the rectangle defined by `r` in [5, 10] and `c` in [5, 10], replace 0s with 9s. Since the grid lines are 7, they are preserved. The 2x2 interiors of the affected cells become 9s.\n\n**Step-by-step row generation:**\n*   **Grid Lines (Rows 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15):** All 7s.\n*   **Cell Rows (Rows 1, 2, 4, 11, 13, 14):** Pattern `7 0 0 7 0 0 ...`.\n*   **Overlay Cell Rows (Rows 5, 7, 8, 10):**\n    *   Columns 0-4: Base pattern `7 0 0 7 0`.\n    *   Columns 5-10 (Overlay): Base is `0 7 0 0 7 0`. 0s become 9s. Result: `9 7 9 9 7 9`.\n    *   Columns 11-15: Base pattern `0 7 0 0 7`.\n    *   Full row: `7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7`.\n*   **Overlay Grid Lines (Row 6, Row 9):**\n    *   Base is all 7s. Overlay does not change 7s.\n    *   Full row: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`.\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,9,7,9,9,7,9,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n1. **The input always contains one small \u201cmotif\u201d**: cells that are *not* the background color (here the background is `7`).  \n   In the examples, that motif fits inside a **3\u00d73 bounding box**.\n\n2. **The output is always a 16\u00d716 \u201cboard\u201d** made of a 5\u00d75 array of **2\u00d72 blocks** separated by **1-cell-thick grid lines**.  \n   Since \\(5\\cdot 2 + 6\\cdot 1 = 16\\), the separator rows/cols occur every 3 cells (indices 1,4,7,10,13,16).\n\n3. **Color roles in the output**\n   - `9` is used to draw the transformed motif (lines/marks).\n   - `0` is the empty/background.\n   - `7` is used as the \u201cfill\u201d color of the board in the non-diagonal case.\n\n4. **How the motif controls what gets drawn**\n   From the three examples, the `9` drawing appears only when the 3\u00d73 motif contains **a complete straight line of motif-color cells** (a full row/column/diagonal).  \n   - Example 1 has a full middle row and full middle column \u2192 it draws the internal grid-cross in `9`.\n   - Example 3 has both diagonals complete \u2192 it draws an `X` in `9`.\n   - Example 2 has complete diagonals and a complete middle row \u2192 it draws an `X` plus horizontal bars.\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\nTest input non-`7` cells are `2` at positions forming a 3\u00d73 box:\n```\n2 7 2\n7 7 7\n2 7 2\n```\nThere is **no full row, no full column, and no full diagonal** of `2` (the center is `7`), so **no `9` strokes are produced**.\n\nTherefore the output is just the standard 16\u00d716 board for the \u201cno-diagonal/no-line\u201d case: **2\u00d72 blocks of `7` separated by `0` grid lines**.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid (16\u00d716)\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,7,7,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",
