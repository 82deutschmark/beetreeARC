        "Full raw LLM response": "**Comprehensive Analysis of an ARC Task with Object Movement**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with solving an ARC problem, and it looks like a visual puzzle involving objects moving within a grid. My initial instinct is to look for patterns in the provided examples \u2013 specifically, how the objects behave and what \"rules\" they might be following.\n\n**Initial Examination and Hypotheses:**\n\n*   I start by examining the first example. I notice different colored \"objects\" (like red, yellow, and blue) against a black background. The main idea is to watch what each example has and what it does.\n*   I start noticing how things are arranged.\n*   The first hypothesis is about \"gravity.\" I figure maybe some objects fall down, but this model doesn't work.\n*   Then, I try to categorize the colors (red as a moving object, for example). This also doesn't work.\n\n**Towards a Unifying Theory:**\n\n*   I get into a theory about objects being pulled together.\n*   I look at more examples and the test input to see what common patterns exist.\n*   I've noticed that sometimes there are fixed lines of a single color (\"anchor\"), and I figure these have a huge part to play.\n*   Next, I am theorizing that the anchor pulls the object towards itself.\n*   I try a new approach. I find myself looking for rules and patterns of how objects move against the anchor.\n*   Now, I refine the \"gravity\" idea, and I consider directions of movement (Up, Down, Left, Right).\n*   For now, I believe there are \"anchor\" colors (usually a vertical line) and then mobile colors. The idea is to find what to do.\n\n**Refining the Logic - Identifying the Core Mechanisms:**\n\n*   I'm digging deeper into the idea of these \"anchor\" colors and the relationship to other objects.\n*   The examples begin to suggest if an object is separate from the anchor, it moves in a perpendicular way, towards the anchor. But if they're \"touching\", the movement is different.\n\n**A Solid Rule - \"Snapping to Anchor\":**\n\n*   I establish a core rule: objects \"snap\" towards the anchor line. There are two kinds of snapping:\n    *   **Perpendicular Snapping:** If objects are separated (gaps exist), they move horizontally towards the anchor.\n    *   **Parallel Snapping:** If objects overlap or are touching the anchor, they move vertically (usually up, to be aligned with the top of the anchor.)\n*   This becomes the basis. It seems to fit the examples. The rule is refined by examining the test input and further refinement of the rule. I think that the rules are \"Snap to Anchor.\"\n*   This involves vertical, and horizontal alignment, based on the grid axis.\n*   The hypothesis is that the groups move to the top, aligned, or touching the anchor.\n\n**Final Solution Generation:**\n\n*   I start to prepare the answer based on the rules.\n*   I double-check everything, including specific coordinate details.\n*   The plan will be to generate this output.\n*   I confirm that the output will have the same dimensions as the test.\n*   I construct the grid and I will be ready to output the transformed grid, based on the established rules.\n\n\nThe transformation involves identifying \"Anchor\" structures and \"Mobile\" structures within each isolated cluster of objects. The \"Anchor\" is the longest straight line of a single color in the cluster. \"Mobile\" pixels are all other non-background pixels in that cluster.\n\nThe movement rules are:\n1.  **Alignment (Parallel Movement):** If the Mobile pixels are adjacent to or overlapping the Anchor (parallel to its axis), they move parallel to the Anchor to align with its \"start\" (Top for vertical anchors, Left for horizontal anchors).\n2.  **Attraction (Perpendicular Movement):** If the Mobile pixels are separated from the Anchor (perpendicular to its axis), they move perpendicular to the Anchor axis until they touch the Anchor (or another object attached to it).\n\nApplying this to the Test Input (Background 8):\n\n*   **Group A (Top Left):**\n    *   **Anchor:** Vertical line of 3s at Column 13 (Rows 0-5).\n    *   **Mobile:** Cluster of 1s to the left (Rows 2-5).\n    *   **Action:** The 1s are adjacent to the vertical anchor. They move **Up** (parallel) to align with the top of the anchor (Row 0).\n    *   **Shift:** Up by 2 rows.\n\n*   **Group B (Middle):**\n    *   **Anchor:** Vertical line of 9s. No mobile pixels.\n    *   **Action:** Unchanged.\n\n*   **Group C (Bottom Right):**\n    *   **Anchor:** Horizontal line of 2s at Row 14.\n    *   **Mobile:** Cluster of 5s and 6s below (Rows 15-19).\n    *   **Action:** The mobile cluster is adjacent to the horizontal anchor. Alignment to the \"Left\" start of the anchor would push pixels out of bounds or break the cluster structure attached at (15,21). Thus, they remain in their stable \"hanging\" position.\n    *   **Shift:** None.\n\n*   **Group D (Bottom Left):**\n    *   **Anchor:** Vertical line of 1s at Column 6 (Rows 22-26).\n    *   **Mobile 1 (4s):** Cluster of 4s to the left (Rows 22-24).\n        *   **Action:** Adjacent to vertical anchor. Align Top. The 4s' top is Row 22, Anchor's top is Row 22. Already aligned.\n        *   **Shift:** None.\n    *   **Mobile 2 (5s):** Cluster of 5s above (Rows 19-20).\n        *   **Action:** Separated vertically from the vertical anchor (Gap at Row 21). Move **Down** (parallel/towards) to touch the anchor structure.\n        *   **Shift:** Down by 1 row.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n- **Group A 1s** move from Rows 2-5 to Rows 0-3.\n- **Group D 5s** move from Rows 19-20 to Rows 20-21.\n- All other pixels remain in their original positions.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,5,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,5,8,8\n8,8,8,8,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,4,4,4,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,4,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, here's my thought process on this ARC task. The user wants me to essentially describe my process in a conversational way, as if I'm deeply engaged with the problem. I'm starting by understanding the core goal: to figure out the rule that transforms the input grids into the output grids.\n\n**Initial Impressions and Example 1 Deep Dive:**\n\nFirst, I notice that it seems like a \"gravity\" problem or possibly an \"attraction\" problem, where the arrangement of the elements in the output grid seems related to their input positions, but with some kind of rearrangement. The user has given me 5 examples with inputs and expected outputs, so that's the data to start with. I'm breaking down each example to identify patterns. For Example 1, I see \"4\"s, \"8\"s, and a \"2\", with a black background. My first intuition is to map out their positions row and column-wise. I notice that the \"4\"s seem to be a diagonal or fragment shape, and \"8\"s and \"2\" are forming a static shape. Looking at the output, the 4s have moved up and right. I'm thinking, does gravity apply? Like, do the shapes \"fall\" toward some static object? I visualize what's happening. The \"4\"s are moving to the right and, at the same time, moving towards the top, which might look like something is pulling them there.  The \"2\" and \"8\" are stationary, so they are fixed objects, and the \"4\"s are the moving ones.\n\nI notice that the \"4\"s in the output now form a vertical line. This seems like a clue. I'm trying to quantify the movement, to establish a rule. It's not a simple shift; the shape of the \"4\"s changed in this example. It looks like the \"4\"s are moving toward the right until they hit the stationary column of \"8\"s. I try counting the \"4\"s. They aren't stacking directly on top of the \"8\"s, but just beside. So, there is some kind of alignment, a \"force\", perhaps.\n\n**Analyzing Subsequent Examples and Forming a Hypothesis:**\n\nI move to Example 2. Here, the background is orange. Now, I have \"4\"s and \"2\"s forming fixed walls, and \"3\"s are moving. It seems, this time, the \"3\"s are moving upward and rightward, potentially toward the \"4\"s and \"2\"s. It looks like they're being \"contained\" by the fixed elements. At this point, I'm thinking there must be some attractor, like a stationary object, that's influencing the \"3\"s' motion. In Example 3, there's another \"wall\" object and the \"7\"s are moving to it at the top left. The direction seems to be toward the walls. Then, Example 4: The moving \"8\"s go up, touching the fixed \"3\"s. Also, Example 5: 9s move towards fixed 3s and 6s. So it looks like a blob-like shape moves towards a fixed wall or object.\n\n**Refining the Hypothesis: \"Mobile\" vs. \"Fixed\" and Movement Rules**\n\nI start to formulate a general hypothesis. I need to identify which objects are \"mobile\" and which are \"fixed\". I'm thinking the mobile objects \"fall\" or move toward fixed objects in the grid. \"2\" seems to be fixed. The direction of gravity seems to vary across the examples. Ex 1: Up-Right. Ex 2: Up. Ex 3: Down-Left. Ex 4: Up. Ex 5: Up-Right. So it's about the closest fixed object.\n\nI realize the fixed objects are vertical and horizontal lines or small dots. I also realize that the shape and nature of those objects also matters. Mobile shapes are often irregularly shaped or fragmented. In the Test Input, there are multiple shapes, so it's a bit more complex. Maybe there's a color/shape connection. I go back to the rule. One irregular shape is the mobile one.\n\nSo I think I have it: The blob shape moves towards the nearest \"fixed/wall\" object. Let's see how I can use this in the Test Input.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input and Generating Output**\n\nThe Test Input has a Blue Top-Left 1s (blob) and a Blue Bottom-Left 1s (Line), for example. They have a \"Gravity Up\" direction. I am assuming that a blob moves to an existing shape with the same color, aligning it. Then, for the \"6\"s, I am going to move them towards the 5s\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Task:**\nThe task involves \"gravity\" or \"attraction\" where specific \"mobile\" objects move towards \"fixed\" objects (walls/anchors) until they collide or align.\n- **Fixed Objects:** These are typically vertical or horizontal lines, or regular rectangles. In the examples and test input, these objects do not change position.\n- **Mobile Objects:** These are typically irregular \"blobs\" or scattered shapes. They move in a specific direction to connect with or rest against the fixed objects.\n- **Direction:** The movement tends to be \"Up\" and towards the nearest fixed object. In most examples, objects move as far up as possible until blocked by a fixed object or the grid boundary, while also maintaining or establishing contact with fixed objects laterally.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    -   **Fixed (Walls):**\n        -   Top-Middle: Vertical line of **3s** (Green) at column 13.\n        -   Middle: Vertical line of **9s** (Maroon) at column 13.\n        -   Right: Horizontal line of **2s** (Red) at row 14.\n        -   Bottom-Left: Vertical line of **1s** (Blue) at column 6.\n        -   Left: Rectangle of **5s** (Grey) at rows 19-20, cols 4-6.\n        -   Right: Irregular shape of **5s** (Grey) at rows 15-20, cols 21-24. (This is irregular but touching the fixed 2s, so it acts as an extension of the wall).\n    -   **Mobile (Blobs):**\n        -   Top-Left: Irregular shape of **1s** (Blue).\n        -   Bottom-Left: Irregular shape of **4s** (Yellow).\n        -   Middle: Small irregular shape of **6s** (Magenta).\n\n2.  **Determine Movements:**\n    -   **1s (Top-Left):** Currently at rows 2-5. Touching the 3s wall at row 5. To maximize \"Up\" gravity while maintaining contact with the 3s (at col 13), they should slide up to align with the top of the grid (row 0), as the 3s wall starts at row 0.\n        -   **Move:** Up by 2 rows.\n        -   **New Position:** Top at row 0.\n    \n    -   **4s (Bottom-Left):** Currently at rows 22-24. Touching the 1s wall (Right) and 1 row below the 5s wall (Top). To obey \"Up\" gravity, they should move up until they hit the 5s wall.\n        -   **Move:** Up by 1 row.\n        -   **New Position:** Top at row 21 (touching 5s at row 20).\n\n    -   **6s (Middle):** Currently at rows 16-17, cols 16-18. Floating in space. The nearest fixed mass is the **5s** (Right) at col 21.

There are \"fixed lines\" (straight horizontal or vertical) that remain unchanged\n2. There are \"irregular shapes\" that get transformed\n3. There may be \"reference shapes\" that guide the transformation\n\nThe transformation appears to:\n- Take an irregular shape that approaches/touches a fixed line\n- Transform it into a diagonal/path that:\n  - Connects across gaps between lines (if two lines exist)\n  - Stays adjacent to the fixed lines\n  - Extends beyond in a diagonal pattern\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nI identify three groups:\n1. **Top area (column 13):** 3s (rows 0-5), 9s (rows 7-9), 1s (irregular shape at rows 2-5)\n2. **Right area:** 2s (horizontal line at row 14), 5s (irregular below), 6s (reference)  \n3. **Left-bottom area:** 5s (block at rows 19-20), 4s (irregular), 1s (vertical line at column 6)\n\n**Applying Transformations:**\n\n1. **Group 1:** The 1s transform to form a diagonal path from row 5 (adjacent to 3s) through row 6 (the gap), then adjacent to 9s (column 14), continuing diagonally\n\n2. **Group 2:** The upper-right 5s reflect across the 2s line (row 14), moving from rows 15-19 to rows 9-13\n\n3. **Group 3:** The 4s transform to extend upward from the 1s line, forming a path adjacent to the 5s block\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,5,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,5,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nIn each example there are three non-background \u201cactors\u201d:\n\n1. **A straight wall** (a long vertical line in the examples) of some color `W`.\n2. **A marker object** of another color `M` (often a short line or small path).\n3. **A moving trail** of a third color `T` that touches the wall at exactly one cell (the \u201cimpact\u201d cell).\n\n**The output keeps the wall and marker unchanged** and **replaces the old trail** with a **new trail of the same color `T` and the same number of cells** (unless it would step out of bounds, then it stops early).  \nThis behaves like \u201ccontinue the motion after bouncing\u201d.\n\n#### How to draw the new trail for one wall\u2013marker\u2013trail group\n\nLet:\n\n- `start` = the unique trail cell (color `T`) that is edge-adjacent to the wall.\n- `N` = number of cells in the original trail component (connected component of color `T` containing `start`).\n\n1. Determine the side of the wall where the trail is (left/right for vertical walls; above/below for horizontal walls). This gives an **\u201caway-from-wall\u201d** direction (one step).\n2. Compute the marker\u2019s **shadow**:\n   - take only the **marker boundary cells** on the side facing **away from the wall** (cells of `M` that have no neighboring `M` one step further away),\n   - shift those boundary cells **one step away from the wall**.\n3. From `start`, move in a straight 8-direction (horizontal/vertical/diagonal) until you first land on the shadow (this is the **entry** point). Mark every visited cell as `T`.\n4. Then follow the shadow component to its end in the direction **parallel to the wall** (for a vertical wall: up/down; for a horizontal wall: left/right), consistent with the approach direction, still marking cells `T`.\n5. \u201cBounce\u201d: flip the component **perpendicular** to the wall (so you now head back **toward** the wall) and keep stepping until you have placed `N` trail cells total (or leave the grid).\n\nApply this independently to each separate wall\u2013marker\u2013trail situation in the test grid.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\nThe test grid contains three independent groups:\n\n1. **Top group:** trail `1` touches wall `3`, marker is `9`.\n2. **Bottom-left group:** trail `4` touches wall `1`, marker is the nearby `5` block.\n3. **Mid-right group:** trail `5` touches horizontal wall `2`, marker is the `6` cluster.\n\nFollowing the rules above yields the output grid below.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,6,6,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,6,6,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,4,5,5,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Transformation inferred from the examples\n\nIn every training pair there are three non-background colors:\n\n- **One color forms a straight \u201cbase\u201d line** (usually the longest, and it stays fixed).\n- **One color forms a smaller \u201ctarget\u201d object** (line or single block, stays fixed).\n- **The remaining color is a scattered \u201crope\u201d**: in the output, *all cells of this rope color are removed from their original places and rearranged*.\n\n**What the rope becomes:**\n1. Find the rope cell that is **touching the base line** (the attachment point). This cell is the **start** of the new rope.\n2. Define a **goal** just past the target on the side *away from the start*:\n   - If the start is above the target, the goal is **one cell below the bottom** of the target.\n   - If the start is below the target, the goal is **one cell above the top** of the target.\n   (If that cell would be outside the grid, pick the closest in-bounds adjacent alternative on that edge.)\n3. Compute the **shortest path using 8-direction moves** (diagonal allowed) from start to goal, **not stepping on fixed objects** (base/target).\n4. Paint the rope color along this path.\n5. If there are rope cells left over, **keep extending** from the goal in the **same direction as the last step** of the shortest path until you run out of rope cells (or hit the grid boundary). Extra rope cells that cannot be placed are simply unused (as in examples 1 and 4).\n\n### Applying it to the test grid\n\nThere are two independent base/target/rope setups:\n\n#### A) Colors (base=3, target=9, rope=1)\n- Start (a `1` touching the `3` line): at **(row 6, col 13)**.\n- Target `9` line is at col 14 rows 8\u201310 \u2192 goal is **(row 11, col 14)**.\n- Shortest path: down the column then one diagonal.\n- There are 14 total `1`s, so after reaching the goal we extend SE (down-right) for the remaining cells.\n\n#### B) Colors (base=2, target=6, rope=5)\n- Start (a `5` touching the `2` line): at **(row 16, col 22)**.\n- Target `6` cluster\u2019s lowest row is 18; the closest bottom cell to the start is at col 19 \u2192 goal is **(row 19, col 19)**.\n- Shortest path is a SW diagonal.\n- There are 13 total `5`s, so we extend SW (down-left) with the remaining cells.\n\nAll other colors (3, 9, 2, 6, 4) remain where they are.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,1,5,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,5,1,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",
