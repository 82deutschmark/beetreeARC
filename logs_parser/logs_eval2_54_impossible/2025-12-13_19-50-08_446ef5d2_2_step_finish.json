The output grid is the same size as the input and is filled with this background except for one reconstructed figure.\n\n2. There is a **marker** made of color **4** that forms an **L-shape** occupying **three cells of a 2\u00d72 block**.  \n   - In the test input, the 2\u00d72 block at rows 2\u20133 and cols 18\u201319 contains three 4\u2019s, and the **missing corner** is at **(row 3, col 18)**.\n   - This **missing corner cell is the anchor** where a corner of the final assembled image must be placed.\n   - The marker indicates the assembled image must extend **away from the 4\u2019s**. Since the 4\u2019s are above/right of the missing cell (missing corner is bottom-left), the assembled image\u2019s **top-right corner** is placed at the anchor.\n\n3. The color at the anchor (row 3 col 18) is **9**, which acts as the **frame/border color** of the pieces to assemble. Ignore the marker color 4 entirely.\n\n4. Collect all **connected non-background, non-marker (\u22608,\u22604)** components; each forms a rectangular \u201ctile\u201d (piece).  \n   - Four tiles are full-height (7 rows) vertical strips.\n   - The right edge is made by stacking a **top-right tile** (border on top+right) and a **bottom-right tile** (border on bottom+right) to get a **7\u00d73** strip.\n\n5. **Order the vertical strips left-to-right** by matching the pattern on the **rightmost column of a strip** to the **leftmost column of another**. This forms a unique chain:\n   - left-border strip \u2192 next \u2192 next \u2192 next \u2192 right-border strip.\n\n6. **Concatenate** these strips horizontally to form a **7\u00d716** complete image.\n\n7. **Place** this 7\u00d716 image into the output grid (filled with 8\u2019s) so that its **top-right corner** is at the anchor **(3,18)**.  \n   Therefore, the image occupies **rows 3\u20139** and **cols 3\u201318** (1-indexed).\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_2_step_1\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Background and marker**\n   - The background color is the most common color: **8**.\n   - Color **4** is a *marker* (it disappears in the output).

Find connected components of the remaining colors (3 and 9) and take their bounding rectangles as pieces.\n3.

This yields a unique chain of strips.\n6. **Place the final reconstructed rectangle with a 2-cell margin to the bottom and right**, as in both examples.  \n   For a `20\u00d720` grid and a `7\u00d716` rectangle, the rectangle occupies **rows 11\u201317** and **cols 2\u201317**.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_F>\n</CANDIDATE 7>\n<CANDIDATE 11>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 20x20\n88888888888888888888\n88888888888888888888\n88888888888888888888\n88888888888888888888\n88888888888888888888\n88888888888888888888\n88888999999999888888\n88888933399939888888\n88888939399339888888\n88888933333339888888\n88888939333339888888\n88888933399339888888\n88888999999999888888\n88888888888888888888\n88888888888888888888\n88888888888888888888\n88888888888888888888\n88888888888888888888\n88888888888888888888\n88888888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Multiple fragments of an object with border color 7 (containing 0 and 2 fills) are scattered across the grid with a marker color 4 indicating position.

Let's break this down. From analyzing the examples, I can see that the objective is to take a set of input shapes and assemble them into a single, cohesive output object. It seems that \"yellow\" shapes are noise to be ignored, and the background color can also be ignored.\n\nMy initial thought is that the output might be a straightforward combination of input pieces, possibly overlapping or adjoining them. This is further clarified by the hints that say something about an \"assembled\" object. Then, I realized the output can be a completed version of just ONE object, but it's *reconstructed* using other pieces found in the input.\n\nIn example 1, the output is a single rectangle with internal structure (0, 2 colors), while the input contains several separate shapes. It seems there is a *relationship* between the input and output. The task is to discover that relationship and apply it to the test input.\n\nI noticed that the outputs in the examples follow a pattern, so let's call that pattern *frame*. The outer structure follows this pattern, and we use that to find and join the objects together.\n\nIn example 2, I can see a more clear example of *assembled* object that is framed. There is symmetry in the example, and some shape mirroring is involved as well.\n\nThe test input contains a variety of fragmented shapes. Some of them appear to overlap others, but this is a distraction: the objective is to *construct* the object based on *the pattern* in the examples.\n\nFrom analyzing the inputs in the examples, I see that this is the process: \n1.  **Eliminate the Noise:** Ignore anything \"yellow\" and all objects attached to yellow parts.\n2.  **Identify Pieces:** Focus on the non-yellow shapes (connected components).\n3.  **Frame Check:** The pieces will be composed of an object that has a specific color pattern (frame)\n4.  **Assembly Rule:** Determine an assembly approach (overlap, adjoining, etc.).\n5.  **Output Alignment:** Determine the location and how to center the object.\n \nIn the examples, I noticed that the pieces fit each other to create the objects.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a complete object from fragmented parts scattered in the input grid. The \"yellow\" colored shapes are indicated to be noise, but they often obscure or attach to valid parts of the object. The goal is to identify the valid non-yellow parts, assemble them into a single coherent rectangular object, and place it in the center of a clean background.\n\n**Analysis of the Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Components:**\n    *   **Left Piece (P1):** A 7x3 strip located at columns 0-2, rows 3-9.\n        *   Pattern: Frame of 9s on Left/Top/Bottom. Inside is mixed 3s and 9s.\n    *   **Center Piece (P2):** A 7x4 strip located at columns 6-9, rows 1-7.\n        *   Pattern: Top/Bottom 9s. Left matches P1's right edge.\n    *   **Right Piece Parts:**\n        *   **Top Part (P_Yellow):** Located in the top-right cluster (rows 2-5, cols 15-18). It is attached to yellow (4) noise. We remove the yellow pixels (4) and keep the remaining valid structure (colors 9 and 3). This yields a 4x3 piece (rows 0-3 of the cluster).\n        *   **Bottom Part (P5):** A 3x3 piece located at columns 11-13, rows 17-19.\n        *   Together, P_Yellow (4 rows) and P5 (3 rows) form a 7-row high strip that acts as the right side of the object.\n\n2.  **Assembly Logic:**\n    *   **Height:** All main components (P1, P2) and the combined Right Piece have a height of 7.\n    *   **Connections:**\n        *   **P1 + P2:** P1 is 3 wide, P2 is 4 wide. The rightmost column of P1 (9,3,9,3,9,3,9) matches perfectly with the leftmost column of P2. They overlap by 1 column.\n        *   **P2 + Right Piece:** The Right Piece (P_Yellow + P5) creates a 3-wide strip. It does not overlap with P2 (based on mismatched edges for overlap), but when placed adjacent to P2, it completes the pattern and forms a solid 9-frame on the right edge.\n    *   **Final Dimensions:**\n        *   Width: P1 (3) + P2 (4) - 1 (overlap) + Right Piece (3) = 9 columns.\n        *   Height: 7 rows.\n\n3.  **Constructed Object (9x7):**\n\n    *   **Row 0:** `9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9` (Solid frame)\n    *   **Row 1:** `9,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,9`\n    *   **Row 2:** `9,3,9,3,9,9,3,3,9`\n    *   **Row 3:** `9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9`\n    *   **Row 4:** `9,3,9,3,3,3,3,3,9`\n    *   **Row 5:** `9,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,9`\n    *   **Row 6:** `9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9` (Solid frame)\n\n4.  **Placement:**\n    *   The object is centered in the 20x20 grid. A 9x7 object roughly centers at starting Row 6, Column 5.\n\n**Output Generation:**\nThe background is filled with 8 (teal). The constructed object is placed centrally.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,9,9,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n</CANDIDATE 11>\n</INPUT_DATA>\n\n<AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\nExecute this pipeline sequentially for every Candidate.

The output grid is the same size as the input and is filled with this background except for one reconstructed figure.\n\n2. There is a **marker** made of color **4** that forms an **L-shape** occupying **three cells of a 2\u00d72 block**.  \n   - In the test input, the 2\u00d72 block at rows 2\u20133 and cols 18\u201319 contains three 4\u2019s, and the **missing corner** is at **(row 3, col 18)**.\n   - This **missing corner cell is the anchor** where a corner of the final assembled image must be placed.\n   - The marker indicates the assembled image must extend **away from the 4\u2019s**. Since the 4\u2019s are above/right of the missing cell (missing corner is bottom-left), the assembled image\u2019s **top-right corner** is placed at the anchor.\n\n3. The color at the anchor (row 3 col 18) is **9**, which acts as the **frame/border color** of the pieces to assemble. Ignore the marker color 4 entirely.\n\n4. Collect all **connected non-background, non-marker (\u22608,\u22604)** components; each forms a rectangular \u201ctile\u201d (piece).  \n   - Four tiles are full-height (7 rows) vertical strips.\n   - The right edge is made by stacking a **top-right tile** (border on top+right) and a **bottom-right tile** (border on bottom+right) to get a **7\u00d73** strip.\n\n5. **Order the vertical strips left-to-right** by matching the pattern on the **rightmost column of a strip** to the **leftmost column of another**. This forms a unique chain:\n   - left-border strip \u2192 next \u2192 next \u2192 next \u2192 right-border strip.\n\n6. **Concatenate** these strips horizontally to form a **7\u00d716** complete image.\n\n7. **Place** this 7\u00d716 image into the output grid (filled with 8\u2019s) so that its **top-right corner** is at the anchor **(3,18)**.  \n   Therefore, the image occupies **rows 3\u20139** and **cols 3\u201318** (1-indexed).\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Background and marker**\n   - The background color is the most common color: **8**.\n   - Color **4** is a *marker* (it disappears in the output).

<EXPLANATION>\n### What the examples show\n\n1. **Background color stays the same**: in both examples the most common color is **8**, and the output is filled with 8 except for one reconstructed object.\n\n2. **Some colors are \u201cdiscarded\u201d**: color **4** appears in inputs but never appears in outputs, so it is treated as junk and removed (turned into background).\n\n3. **The remaining colored cells form rectangular fragments** (tiles/strips).  \n   These fragments are reassembled into one larger rectangle by:\n   - **stacking fragments vertically** when they have the same width and the touching **edge rows are identical**, and\n   - **joining fragments horizontally** when they have the same height and the touching **edge columns are identical**.\n\n4. **Placement rule**: the reconstructed rectangle is placed so that there are exactly **2 rows of background below it and 2 columns of background to its right** (bottom-right anchored with a 2-cell margin).  \n   This matches both solved examples.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n1. **Set all 4s to 8** (discard junk color).\n2. Find connected components of the remaining colors (3 and 9) and take their bounding rectangles as pieces.\n3. One right-side piece is formed by **stacking** the only 4\u00d73 fragment on top of the 3\u00d73 fragment (their touching rows match).\n4.

On the far right, two smaller tiles stack vertically (their touching row is identical), forming a full-height right column whose **right edge is all 9**.\n\n   This yields one combined rectangle of size **7\u00d716**.\n\n5. **Place the assembled rectangle in the output grid**  \n   As in both examples, place the final rectangle so it sits **2 cells away from the bottom and 2 cells away from the right edge**, filling the rest with background **8**.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"E\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_12_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Background color is 8**.

This yields a unique chain of strips.\n6. **Place the final reconstructed rectangle with a 2-cell margin to the bottom and right**, as in both examples.  \n   For a `20\u00d720` grid and a `7\u00d716` rectangle, the rectangle occupies **rows 11\u201317** and **cols 2\u201317**.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n      8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"11\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Multiple fragments of an object with border color 7 (containing 0 and 2 fills) are scattered across the grid with a marker color 4 indicating position.

Let's break this down. From analyzing the examples, I can see that the objective is to take a set of input shapes and assemble them into a single, cohesive output object. It seems that \"yellow\" shapes are noise to be ignored, and the background color can also be ignored.\n\nMy initial thought is that the output might be a straightforward combination of input pieces, possibly overlapping or adjoining them. This is further clarified by the hints that say something about an \"assembled\" object. Then, I realized the output can be a completed version of just ONE object, but it's *reconstructed* using other pieces found in the input.\n\nIn example 1, the output is a single rectangle with internal structure (0, 2 colors), while the input contains several separate shapes. It seems there is a *relationship* between the input and output. The task is to discover that relationship and apply it to the test input.\n\nI noticed that the outputs in the examples follow a pattern, so let's call that pattern *frame*. The outer structure follows this pattern, and we use that to find and join the objects together.\n\nIn example 2, I can see a more clear example of *assembled* object that is framed. There is symmetry in the example, and some shape mirroring is involved as well.\n\nThe test input contains a variety of fragmented shapes. Some of them appear to overlap others, but this is a distraction: the objective is to *construct* the object based on *the pattern* in the examples.\n\nFrom analyzing the inputs in the examples, I see that this is the process: \n1.  **Eliminate the Noise:** Ignore anything \"yellow\" and all objects attached to yellow parts.\n2.  **Identify Pieces:** Focus on the non-yellow shapes (connected components).\n3.  **Frame Check:** The pieces will be composed of an object that has a specific color pattern (frame)\n4.  **Assembly Rule:** Determine an assembly approach (overlap, adjoining, etc.).\n5.  **Output Alignment:** Determine the location and how to center the object.\n \nIn the examples, I noticed that the pieces fit each other to create the objects.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a complete object from fragmented parts scattered in the input grid. The \"yellow\" colored shapes are indicated to be noise, but they often obscure or attach to valid parts of the object. The goal is to identify the valid non-yellow parts, assemble them into a single coherent rectangular object, and place it in the center of a clean background.\n\n**Analysis of the Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Components:**\n    *   **Left Piece (P1):** A 7x3 strip located at columns 0-2, rows 3-9.\n        *   Pattern: Frame of 9s on Left/Top/Bottom. Inside is mixed 3s and 9s.\n    *   **Center Piece (P2):** A 7x4 strip located at columns 6-9, rows 1-7.\n        *   Pattern: Top/Bottom 9s. Left matches P1's right edge.\n    *   **Right Piece Parts:**\n        *   **Top Part (P_Yellow):** Located in the top-right cluster (rows 2-5, cols 15-18). It is attached to yellow (4) noise. We remove the yellow pixels (4) and keep the remaining valid structure (colors 9 and 3). This yields a 4x3 piece (rows 0-3 of the cluster).\n        *   **Bottom Part (P5):** A 3x3 piece located at columns 11-13, rows 17-19.\n        *   Together, P_Yellow (4 rows) and P5 (3 rows) form a 7-row high strip that acts as the right side of the object.\n\n2.  **Assembly Logic:**\n    *   **Height:** All main components (P1, P2) and the combined Right Piece have a height of 7.\n    *   **Connections:**\n        *   **P1 + P2:** P1 is 3 wide, P2 is 4 wide. The rightmost column of P1 (9,3,9,3,9,3,9) matches perfectly with the leftmost column of P2. They overlap by 1 column.\n        *   **P2 + Right Piece:** The Right Piece (P_Yellow + P5) creates a 3-wide strip. It does not overlap with P2 (based on mismatched edges for overlap), but when placed adjacent to P2, it completes the pattern and forms a solid 9-frame on the right edge.\n    *   **Final Dimensions:**\n        *   Width: P1 (3) + P2 (4) - 1 (overlap) + Right Piece (3) = 9 columns.\n        *   Height: 7 rows.\n\n3.  **Constructed Object (9x7):**\n\n    *   **Row 0:** `9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9` (Solid frame)\n    *   **Row 1:** `9,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,9`\n    *   **Row 2:** `9,3,9,3,9,9,3,3,9`\n    *   **Row 3:** `9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9`\n    *   **Row 4:** `9,3,9,3,3,3,3,3,9`\n    *   **Row 5:** `9,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,9`\n    *   **Row 6:** `9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9` (Solid frame)\n\n4.  **Placement:**\n    *   The object is centered in the 20x20 grid. A 9x7 object roughly centers at starting Row 6, Column 5.\n\n**Output Generation:**\nThe background is filled with 8 (teal). The constructed object is placed centrally.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,9,9,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,9,9,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,3,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- SELECT THE BEST RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1.

Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
