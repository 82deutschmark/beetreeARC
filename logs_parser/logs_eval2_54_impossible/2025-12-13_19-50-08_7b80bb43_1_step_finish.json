The examples are showing a pattern, and I need to figure it out. It's like taking a shaky line and making it straight, while keeping the main features.\n\nThe input grids seem to contain \"background\" (usually represented by 1 or 0) and \"foreground\" which are colored from 0 to 9. The main thing seems to be that those foreground numbers are creating lines, often with a \"staircase\" or jagged look. The task is to straighten those lines into Manhattan geometry which includes vertical and horizontal segments and 90 degree corners.\n\n**The Breakdown:**\n\nFirst, I need to look at each example and understand the changes between the input and output.\n\n*   **Example 1**: The main foreground number here is 6.  I need to follow the 6s across the input and the output. It's like they have two blobs of 6s, and a long jagged line that is somehow connecting them.\n    *   The \"jagged\" parts (diagonal segments) are replaced by straight vertical or horizontal lines, or by simply extending the existing segments.\n    *   The horizontal run is somehow connected to the vertical.\n    *   I'm seeing that if there is a small \"gap\" in a horizontal line, like three 1s in a row, they are filled if they're close enough to each other.\n    *   The \"hints\" give the main rule: jagged or diagonal runs disappear, and straight segments are preserved and sometimes extended to connect and form right angles. This is crucial.\n\n*   **Example 2**: Foreground number is 3.\n    *   There is a vertical line. There is a horizontal line. The \"jagged\" bits are making a kind of staircase connecting the vertical and the horizontal. In the Output, the jagged pixels are removed or incorporated in the nearest existing horizontal or vertical segment (extending the horizontal segment to the right or extending the vertical segment down to form a corner).\n    *   There's also some \"jagged\" stuff off to the side, not really connected to anything but the vertical line. The output, they simply extend the vertical line and remove the jagged bits.  The jagged stuff acts like a bridge and they fill in the connection, forming an L shape.\n    *   So, a straight segment can extend to clean up the connections. Or, jagged bits with no purpose are just deleted.\n    *   They're replacing the staircase with an L-shape if the segments are perpendicular and close enough or if they will overlap.\n\n**Forming a Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Structures**: The core of the strategy is to identify horizontal and vertical segments of the foreground numbers that have a length greater than 1, and this should form the rigid framework. These segments are the things you want to keep.\n2.  **Find the Tails**: Jagged \"tails\" or staircase pixels need to be identified next. These are either \"bridges\" between the existing segments or stand on their own.\n3.  **Process those Tails**. I'll follow these rules:\n\n    *   **Connections**: If a \"tail\" connects two straight segments, extend the segments to meet at the joint of the tail in the form of an L. The pixels in the stair case are removed.\n    *   **Dangling Tails**: if a straight segment has a dangling tail that is not connected to a new segment, extend the existing straight segment over to cover the tail.\n    *   **Gaps**: if two segments have close gaps, the gaps can be filled to remove the gap and connect them.\n\n**Applying the Plan**:\n\nSo here are the steps in action:\n\n1.  **Read the Input**: I need to examine the input grid thoroughly.\n2.  **Identify Straight Lines**: Find horizontal and vertical lines in the grid that have a length greater than 1.\n3.  **Find Tails**: Now look for the 1-pixel \"jumps\" that are attached to the existing straight lines, or those standing independently (these are \"tails\" or gaps).\n4.  **Connect or Fix**: Apply the rules of connection that I just developed.\n5.  **Remove Tail Pixels**: Delete or \"project\" these diagonal segments by extending the existing straight lines onto them. Fill in gaps between lines if they are close together.\n6.  **Output the result**: Put out the new transformed grid.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input**:\n\nNow, I'll need to apply this to the new test input and test it out. It's about finding the lines, tails and removing or extending those parts, making the outputs fit the plan. And double checking\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of integers representing colors. Based on the solved examples and the hints provided, the transformation rules can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.  **Rectilinear Geometry:** The transformation \"cleans up\" the foreground geometry (9s in the test input) by enforcing Manhattan geometry (horizontal and vertical lines only). Diagonal or \"staircase\" lines are removed or rectified.\n2.  **Preserve and Extend:** Existing straight vertical and horizontal segments are preserved. If a diagonal or irregular path connects two such segments (or suggests a continuation of one), the straight segments are extended to meet or cover the extent of the irregular path.\n3.  **Local Transformation:** Segments that are completely isolated and not part of a \"jagged\" connector structure remain unchanged.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\n\n*   **Top Left (Rows 3):** There is a small horizontal segment `9,9` at `(R3, C0-C1)`. It is separated from the rest of the structure by a gap of background pixels. As an isolated straight segment, it is preserved.\n*   **Vertical Line at C6:** There is a vertical segment of 9s at Column 6, running from Row 3 to Row 13.\n    *   There is a diagonal \"tail\" attached to the top of this line (pixels at `(R3, C5)`, `(R4, C4)`, `(R5, C3)`). Since this tail does not connect to another structure and extending the vertical line doesn't make sense (it's already there), the tail is removed.\n    *   This vertical line meets the horizontal line at Row 14.\n*   **Horizontal Line at R14:** There is a horizontal segment of 9s at Row 14, spanning Columns 0 to 9.\n    *   This line connects cleanly with the vertical line at C6.\n    *   There is a diagonal \"tail\" attached to the bottom of this line (pixels at `(R15, C2)`, `(R16, C3)`). This tail is removed.\n*   **Vertical Line at C14:** There is a vertical structure at Column 14.\n    *   It exists from Row 0 to Row 19, and then from Row 23 to Row 28.\n    *   There is a gap and a jagged deviation at Rows 20-22 (pixels at `(R20, C15)`, `(R21, C16)`).\n    *   To rectify this, the vertical line at C14 is made continuous from Row 0 to Row 28, and the jagged pixels at C15/C16 are removed.\n*   **Connecting the Structures (The Bridge):**\n    *   There are floating diagonal pixels at `(R11, C12)` and `(R12, C11)`.

These form \u201cstaircase\u201d diagonals.\n\n3. **Straighten each diagonal-only staircase**\n   - If a diagonal-only connected group touches an orthogonal segment **diagonally**, it is \u201csnapped\u201d onto that segment:\n     - If it touches a pixel that is part of a **horizontal** segment (has a left/right `9`), project the whole diagonal group onto that **row** (same columns).\n     - If it touches a pixel that is part of a **vertical** segment (has an up/down `9`), project the whole diagonal group onto that **column** (same rows).\n   - If a diagonal-only group touches **no** orthogonal segment at all, it is removed as stray diagonal noise.\n\n4. **Fill 1-cell gaps**  \n   After straightening, any pattern `9 8 9` in a row or column becomes `9 9 9` (fill the single missing cell).  \n   (This closes small breaks but does not bridge larger gaps, preserving \u201cdashed\u201d separations.)\n\n### Applying this to the test grid (high level)\n- The small diagonal near the top-left is snapped into the top horizontal segment, making row 4 continuous from column 1 to 7.\n- The isolated diagonal pair around rows 12\u201313 has no orthogonal anchor, so it is removed.\n- The diagonal step near row 17 is snapped into the short vertical at column 3.\n- The bottom diagonal drift from column 15 to the right is snapped back onto column 15, then the remaining 1-cell gaps in that column are filled, producing a continuous vertical line.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,9,9,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_D>\n</CANDIDATE 4>\n<CANDIDATE 6>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 29x17\n88888888888888988\n88888888888888988\n88888888888888988\n99999998888888988\n88888898888888988\n88888898888888988\n88888898888888988\n88888898888888988\n88888898888888988\n88888898888888988\n88888898888888988\n88888898888888988\n88888898888888988\n88888898888888988\n99999999999999988\n88888888888888988\n88888888888888988\n88888888888888988\n88888888888888988\n88888888888888988\n88888888888888988\n88888888888888988\n88888888888888988\n88888888888888988\n88888888888888988\n88888888888888988\n88888888888888988\n88888888888888988\n88888888888888988\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_4_step_3\">\n**Initial Assessment and Exploration**\n\nOkay, so the task at hand is to solve an ARC challenge based on two examples and a test input. Let's dig in. It seems the input consists of grids with background and foreground colors, and the goal is to transform these grids in some way.\n\n**Example 1: Hypothesis Formation**\n\nI'm starting by analyzing the first example, focusing on identifying patterns and changes between the input and output. The background color in example one is blue (`1`), and the shapes are magenta (`6`). I'm looking for distinct shapes, like lines and connected components. I'm noting specific coordinates of the magenta pixels. There are both vertical and horizontal lines of color `6`. It appears there are \"gaps\" in the lines. I then compare the input and output, noting a specific row as an interesting point of analysis. It looks like the output merges segments from the input when there is a short gap between them. Hmm, the rule might involve \"healing\" broken lines.  I start to hypothesize that removing \"noise\" pixels that don't belong to any apparent lines and completing the existing lines is crucial. This leads me to examine how \"broken\" lines (lines with gaps) are being treated and what constitutes a \"valid\" line.\n\n**Example 1: Rule Refinement**\n\nThe exploration continues by looking at isolated pixels, determining their characteristics and how they are handled. I look at different horizontal and vertical lines, with varying lengths and gaps, in search of more details of the process. I identify \"objects\" and try to determine the rule for merging or splitting lines.  A pattern emerges: isolated, single-pixel segments are removed. However, to fill a gap, there might have to be alignment or intersecting perpendicular lines. It seems short segments are removed but longer segments are kept, but now I'm trying to figure out if there is a threshold, or if they need to be connected to a larger segment. I formulate a hypothesis that combines removing noise (isolated pixels) and completing lines (merging segments with small gaps). It looks like the logic involves identifying horizontal and vertical line structures.\n\n**Example 2: Rule Validation and Adjustment**\n\nI then shift my focus to the second example to test my hypothesis. The foreground color is green (`3`). There's a set of \"dots\", potentially part of some underlying structure. Now I start to see \"shifted\" or \"diagonal\" pixels, which might be noise. There is a lot of noise removal and line completion going on. From this, the rule is forming more clearly. It seems there is a \"snap to grid\" effect, where diagonal or out-of-line pixels move to align to the horizontal or vertical lines. I refine my understanding of the noise removal and how this affects the grid. I test the idea of filtering out the noise by removing the pixel if it has no horizontal or vertical neighbors.\n\n**Synthesis and Test Input Analysis**\n\nWith these examples, I now have a solid grip on the task. I hypothesize that the task is \"Repair Lines\" or \"Snap to Grid\".\nThe process is:\n\n1.  Noise Removal.\n2.  Gap Filling (for short gaps only).\n\nThe test input contains teal background (`8`) and maroon foreground (`9`). There are vertical and horizontal lines in a pattern that is more complex than the examples. I now construct a map of where the pixels are. I map out the coordinates of the 9s. I see that the pixels are both noisy and can form structured shapes. I then determine the best method for removing noise and filling gaps. I start formulating the code to deal with all the rules. The pixels look like a construction, so I draw out the \"main\" lines.\n\n**Construction and Solution**\n\nThe task now becomes an exercise in identifying the line segments, drawing out where they should be, and using a loop to filter and fill in any gaps or noise. I finalize the rules and go through the Test Input one final time to verify that my analysis is correct. It all looks perfect! With my rules in place, I can construct the final output. The main structural lines are vertical line at x=14 from y=0 to y=28, horizontal line y=14 from x=0 to x=14, vertical line at x=6, y=3..14, and horizontal line at y=3 from x=0 to x=6. I am now confident about constructing the output matrix. I have completely validated my approach and generated the output.\n\n\n\nThe problem asks us to infer a transformation rule from two examples and apply it to a test input. The grids contain integer values representing colors.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains horizontal and vertical lines of color `6` (magenta) on a background of `1` (blue). The lines have gaps (missing pixels) and there is \"noise\" (isolated pixels scattered diagonally).\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   **Noise Removal:** Isolated pixels that do not form part of the main horizontal or vertical lines are removed (e.g., pixels at (3,19), (8,17), etc.).\n        *   **Gap Filling:** Gaps in the lines are filled. For instance, in Row 7, a gap of 3 pixels between two segments was filled to create a continuous line. Note that not all gaps are filled; specifically, gaps crossed by a perpendicular line *terminating* at the gap (like the gap at Row 7, Cols 3-5 crossed by the vertical line at Col 4) might remain. However, gaps that simply connect segments of a single line are filled.\n    *   **Output:** Clean, continuous lines forming a cohesive structure.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains broken lines of color `3` (green) on `0` (black). It also contains \"shifted\" pixels (e.g., in column 18, some pixels are at 19 or 20).\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   **Line Repair:** The vertical line at Column 18 is repaired. The shifted pixels are removed, and the gap in the column is filled.\n        *   **Gap Filling:** A horizontal gap in Row 9 is filled.\n    *   **Output:** Continuous vertical and horizontal lines.\n\n**Logic Applied to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Background:** `8` (teal).\n*   **Foreground:** `9` (maroon).\n*   **Identify Structures:**\n    *   **Vertical Line (Column 14):** The input has a nearly continuous line in column 14 from row 0 to 19, then shifted pixels in rows 20-21, a gap in 22, segments in 23-25 and 27-28. Following the logic, we treat this as a single continuous vertical line spanning the full height (Rows 0-28). The shifted pixels (noise) are removed, and the gaps are filled.\n    *   **Vertical Line (Column 6):** The input shows a clear vertical segment in column 6 from Row 3 to Row 13.\n    *   **Horizontal Line (Row 14):** There is a segment from Col 0 to 9, a gap at 10-12, and a segment at 13-14. This gap connects the left segment to the vertical spine at Col 14. We fill this gap to form a line from Col 0 to 14.\n    *   **Horizontal Line (Row 3):** There is a segment at Col 0-1, a gap at 2-4, and a segment at 5-6. The segment at 5-6 connects to the top of the vertical line at Col 6. We fill the gap to form a line from Col 0 to 6.\n    *   **Noise Removal:** Isolated pixels appearing at (4,4), (5,3), (11,12), (12,11), (15,2), (16,3), (20,15), and (21,16) are removed. They do not align with the reconstructed lines.\n\n**Reconstructed Lines:**\n1.  **Vertical Line:** Column 14, Rows 0 to 28.\n2.  **Horizontal Line:** Row 14, Columns 0 to 14.\n3.  **Vertical Line:** Column 6, Rows 3 to 14 (connecting the two horizontal lines).\n4.  **Horizontal Line:** Row 3, Columns 0 to 6.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\n*   Initialize grid with background `8`.\n*   Set `(row, col)` to `9` if:\n    *   `col == 14` (for all rows)\n    *   `row == 14` AND `col <= 14`\n    *   `col == 6` AND `3 <= row <= 14`\n    *   `row == 3` AND `col <= 6`\n\nThe output matches these coordinates.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_3\">\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Identify main straight lines (horizontal and vertical)** made of the non-background color\n2. **Find diagonal patterns** that branch off from these straight lines\n3. **Remove diagonals** and **extend/complete the straight lines** by filling gaps\n\nLet me analyze the test input (background=8, pattern color=9):\n\n**Main structures identified:**\n- Vertical line at column 14 (rows 0-28 with gaps at rows 20-22, 26)\n- Vertical line at column 6 (rows 3-14)\n- Horizontal line at row 14 (cols 0-9 and 13-14, gap at cols 10-12)\n- Horizontal line at row 3 (cols 0-1 and 5-6, gap at cols 2-4)\n\n**Diagonals to fix:**\n1.

It's all about two colors, a background and a foreground. I can see the pattern already, the key lies in understanding how the foreground elements change from the input to the output.\n\n**Analyzing the Clues**\n\n*   **Color Identification:** First step is to quickly recognize what's foreground and what's background in the examples and the test input (1-6 in Example 1, 0-3 in Example 2, 8-9 in the test case).\n\n*   **Identifying the Patterns:** Looking at the solved examples, I immediately see lines \u2013 vertical, horizontal, some diagonals \u2013 made with the foreground color (6s in Example 1, 3s in Example 2).\n\n**First Observation - The \"Jaggedness\" of the Connections**\n\n*   **Initial Thought:** I focus on the \"jagged\" connections between straight horizontal or vertical segments, these need straightening. I see \"gaps\" and \"diagonal runs\" that are connected, so I suspect that those connections will be changed to straight.\n\n*   **Example 1 Insights:** In Example 1, there's a horizontal line with a gap, and a diagonal \"bridge\" below it, it's clear the output \"straightens\" that. My hint: *\"Jagged/staircase (diagonal-looking) runs disappear in the output.\"*\n\n*   **Key Insight:** Okay, the pattern is: *\"Identify jagged diagonal connections between straight segments. Replace the jagged path with a straight line (extension of the existing straight segments) to connect them.\"* This is my main hypothesis. It works by extending existing lines to bridge connections.\n\n**Building the Strategy - General Algorithm**\n\n*   **Step 1:** Recognize the foreground \"objects\" or patterns as connected components.\n*   **Step 2:** Within each object, Identify straight horizontal or vertical lines. These are what I am extending.\n*   **Step 3:** Now, identify jagged parts (diagonal lines) that connect the segments.\n*   **Step 4:** If two points A and B are part of a jagged connection:\n    *   If A and B are in the same row, make a straight horizontal line between them.\n    *   If A and B are in the same column, draw a vertical line.\n    *   If neither, the hint says, \"extend\" the existing lines.\n\n**Testing Hypothesis**\n\n*   **Example 2 Validation:** I check Example 2 to make sure that rule works in a new setting. It has the same behaviour: Diagonals are being replaced by straight vertical lines or the extension of existing vertical lines.\n*   **Example Verification:** I re-examine Example 1 for a detailed understanding of how each diagonal \"jagged\" bit disappears and how it is replaced by an \"extension.\"\n*   **Edge Case Analysis:** The \"drifts\" from vertical to diagonal back to vertical lines were analyzed, to check that it extends the straightest parts. The hint \"straight horizontal/vertical segments are preserved\" shows the behaviour of extending one over another.\n\n**Putting Theory into Practice - The Test Input**\n\n*   **Test Input Scrutiny:** I meticulously look at the test input. It's critical to identify all the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments.\n*   **Identifying Patterns**: I'm on the lookout for vertical line, horizontal lines, and the places where segments are *not* directly connected (gaps) as these are the place where the \"transformation\" will happen.\n*   **The Structure is Clear** : Once all the inputs are analysed I can see the whole structure. I see where to fill the gaps.\n\n**Challenges and Adaptations**\n\n*   **Sprout Analysis**: There's a particular issue with diagonal \"dangles\" or \"sprouts\" that aren't connecting anything. I have to interpret if this is just noise or part of some intentional construction. The hypothesis is: *If the diagonal segment is \"disappeared\", and there is no straight segment to extend *over* it...Then maybe it just disappears.* I choose to remove these dangling diagonal pieces.\n\n*   **Edge Extension:** I verify if there are any edges on which the diagonal segments have to stop. I use the hint about vertical extension, I choose to extend vertical lines to the end of the image.\n\n**Final Touches**\n\n*   **Algorithm Refinement:** Review the logic: the goal is to make a \"clean\" grid with right-angle junctions.\n*   **Double Check Every Pixel:** Before converting to an output grid, I go over every change, confirming everything.\n*   **Ensure it has the correct size\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the examples. The examples show a \"rectification\" process where jagged, diagonal, or disconnected lines of the foreground color are replaced by clean, straight horizontal and vertical lines. Specifically:\n- **Jagged/Diagonal Lines Disappear:** Any sequence of pixels moving diagonally (staircase pattern) is removed or replaced.\n- **Straight Segments are Preserved and Extended:** Existing vertical and horizontal segments are kept. If two segments are connected by a jagged line (or clearly meant to connect), they are extended to meet at a right angle, filling the gap.\n- **Connectivity:** The goal is to create a clean, rectilinear circuit or structure that maintains the connectivity implied by the original \"messy\" input.\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\nThe input grid (29 rows, 17 columns) contains a background of 8 and a foreground of 9. We identify the following structures:\n\n1.  **Vertical Line at Column 14:**\n    - There is a strong vertical line of 9s in column 14 appearing in rows 0-19, 23-25, and 27-28.\n    - There is a \"drift\" or jagged break in rows 20-21 where the pixels shift to columns 15 and 16.\n    - There are gaps in rows 22 and 26.\n    - **Action:** Restore the vertical line at column 14 to be continuous from the top (row 0) to the bottom (row 28). The drifting pixels are removed, and the gaps are filled to create a single solid vertical bar.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Line at Row 3 (Top Left):**\n    - There are 9s at `(3,0), (3,1)` and `(3,5), (3,6)`.\n    - A jagged diagonal sequence `(3,5), (4,4), (5,3)` appears to bridge the gap between the left segment and the vertical structure at column 6.\n    - **Action:** The intended structure is a straight horizontal line at row 3 connecting the left edge to column 6. We fill the segment from column 0 to column 6 with 9s. The diagonal artifacts `(4,4)` and `(5,3)` are removed.\n\n3.  **Vertical Line at Column 6 (Top Middle):**\n    - There is a solid vertical line of 9s in column 6 from row 3 down to row 13.\n    - **Action:** Preserve this line. It connects the top horizontal line (row 3) to the bottom horizontal line (row 14).\n\n4.  **Horizontal Line at Row 14 (Middle):**\n    - There is a horizontal line of 9s from column 0 to column 9, and then at columns 13 and 14.\n    - There is a gap at columns 10, 11, 12.\n    - Jagged pixels at `(11,12)` and `(12,11)` exist in the \"corner\" formed by this line and the vertical line at column 14.\n    - **Action:** Fill the horizontal line at row 14 continuously from column 0 to column 14. This creates a clean junction with the vertical line at column 14. The jagged pixels are removed.\n\n5.  **Diagonal \"Sprout\" at `(15,2), (16,3)`:**\n    - These pixels form a diagonal tail coming off the horizontal line at row 14.\n    - Unlike the other structures, this does not connect two existing segments. In Example 2, a dangling diagonal was turned into a vertical line extending to the edge. However, in this specific case, the diagonal is very short (2 pixels) and does not align with any vertical structure above it. Given the rule \"jagged runs disappear\" and the lack of a target to connect to, these are interpreted as noise/debris.\n    - **Action:** Remove these pixels.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\n- **Rows 0-2:** Background 8, with 9 at col 14.\n- **Row 3:** 9s at cols 0-6 and 14. Background 8 elsewhere.\n- **Rows 4-13:** 9s at cols 6 and 14. Background 8 elsewhere.\n- **Row 14:** 9s at cols 0-14. Background 8 elsewhere.\n- **Rows 15-28:** 9 at col 14.

We have two example input-output pairs to guide us, and I need to figure out the underlying logic.\n\nFirstly, I'm identifying the key features: the background and foreground colors (0, 1, 8, and 3, 6, 9 respectively), and the \"noisy\" nature of the foreground lines. My main aim is to create clean, continuous lines, eliminating any jitter or gaps. I'm focusing on vertical and horizontal lines primarily.\n\nLooking at Example 1, I'm analyzing the pixel coordinates to trace the structures. I'm tracking the behavior of pixels near the expected line positions. Key is: Pixels deviating from a clear vertical line (like in column 14) are not part of the output, while ones in a group or close to the line are treated as valid for its extension. These deviating pixels are effectively moved to straighten the line. Also, I'm checking gap filling: small gaps (size 3) are merged within an otherwise contiguous line. I am investigating why some gaps are filled and some are not.\n\nIn Example 2, I'm trying to see if I can generalize. I'm taking notes on situations where pixels are removed or kept. For example, vertical line segments with only a few connected foreground pixels are removed, while longer, connected segments are retained, even if there are small gaps. Gap filling also has different behaviours in these two examples.\n\nI hypothesize that the algorithm detects lines using density-based thresholding, straightens them, and fills small gaps *within* those lines. The removal of 'noisy' pixels seems to depend on their proximity to a \"main line\" - pixels near the line, even if slightly offset, are \"snapped\" to it, and pixels far away from any strong line are removed as noise. In Ex. 2, `(9,23)` is close to another horizontal segment and got merged, while the diagonal `(17,19), (18,18), (19,17)` at the bottom-right became empty because they had no valid vertical or horizontal neighbors. The goal seems to be the simplification of the visual structure into solid vertical/horizontal lines.\n\nI refined this understanding to the following strategy: 1) Identify rows and columns where there are a significant number of foreground pixels, and use these as the main lines. \"Significant\" depends on the grid sizes. 2) Snap any pixel within a small distance (say, 1 or 2 pixels, depending on examples) of a detected line to it. Pixels that do not \"snap\" or have no neighbor lines are discarded. 3) For each line, plot the snapped pixels to create the cleaned version of the line. The final step is gap filling: any small internal gaps (say of 1- or 2-pixel width) within the constructed lines are filled.\n\nNow, I'm ready to apply this to the test input. First, I'm checking for vertical and horizontal lines using pixel counts to define the coordinates to form lines. The goal is to make the code flexible to the varying pixel counts. Then, I need to translate all this into a step-by-step procedure to convert the test input. This includes: Identifying pixels to snap (those closest to the main lines), filling gaps and finally rendering the corrected grid. I'm applying what I've learned to the test input and checking the logic. I am also carefully checking the distance constraints and gap thresholds based on the existing examples.\n\nI am now in the stage of building the output from scratch, where I will define foreground or background pixels given the above strategy.\n\nI have found lines at rows 3 and 14, and columns 6 and 14. I identified a \"wobbly\" line structure along columns 15 to 16. I am now at the stage of analyzing how those elements are affected by the straightening strategy. I am at the pixel level now.\n\nBy applying the steps, pixels not fitting on one of the lines will become part of the background. I confirmed that vertical lines span from the top to bottom. Horizontal lines span from the left to right of the grid. All the logic is implemented to deal with any situation with the test case to generate the output grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to perform a \"line repair\" transformation on the grid. Based on the provided examples, the logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Structure**: Detect dominant vertical and horizontal lines in the grid. A line is defined by a row or column containing a significant number of foreground pixels (color 9).\n    *   **Vertical Lines**: Scanning the columns, we see a strong vertical presence in **Column 14** (index 14) running the full height, and **Column 6** running from the top horizontal line to the bottom one.\n    *   **Horizontal Lines**: Scanning the rows, we see a strong horizontal presence in **Row 14** (spanning the left side) and **Row 3** (spanning the top left).\n\n2.  **Snap & Straighten**: Deviated or \"jittery\" pixels that are near a dominant line (within a distance of 1 or 2 pixels) are \"snapped\" onto that line.\n    *   **Around Horizontal Line Row 3**: Pixels at `(4,4)` and `(5,3)` are misaligned segments of this line. `(4,4)` is distance 1 from Row 3, so it snaps to `(3,4)`. `(5,3)` is distance 2 from Row 3, so it snaps to `(3,3)`.\n    *   **Around Horizontal Line Row 14**: Pixels at `(15,2)` and `(16,3)` are noise below the line. `(15,2)` snaps to `(14,2)`. `(16,3)` snaps to `(14,3)`. The pixel at `(12,11)` is distance 2 from Row 14 and distance 5 from Col 6, so it snaps to `(14,11)`.\n    *   **Around Vertical Line Col 14**: The pixel at `(11,12)` is distance 2 from Col 14, so it snaps to `(11,14)`. The deviated segment at the bottom `(20,15)` and `(21,16)` snaps back to the line at `(20,14)` and `(21,14)`.\n\n3.  **Fill Gaps**: After snapping, small gaps in the confirmed lines are filled to create continuous segments.\n    *   **Row 3**: After snapping, we have pixels at 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6. The gap at index 2 is size 1, so it is filled. The line becomes continuous from **0 to 6**. There is also a pixel at 14, but the gap (7-13) is too large to fill, so it remains separate.\n    *   **Row 14**: The line spans 0-9 originally. Snapping `(12,11)` to `(14,11)` creates a pixel at 11. Gaps at 10 and 12 are size 1, so they are filled. The original pixels at 13, 14 connect.

My initial hypothesis is that it's about straightening out messy lines that have unwanted pixel noise, or maybe filling in gaps in lines that appear to be intentionally designed. I've already scrutinized two examples:\n\n**Example 1**: The input is filled with messy, broken segments of magenta (color 6), and the desired output is a cleaned-up version of those segments into horizontal and vertical lines. I saw that diagonal segments got removed, short segments got eliminated, and the broken segments got connected.\n\n**Example 2**: I observed a similar \"straightening\" process but in black/green color scheme (background 0 and target color 3). The aim seems to be connecting a broken vertical line in the middle to the right side and cleaning up some of the diagonal noise pixels.\n\nSo, the basic task is to create a \"repaired\" version of the image. The line that should be continuous would be the one that is the longest, i.e., has the most number of contiguous pixels. Gaps in the target line would be bridged by nearby \"noise\" pixels. The noise pixels would be removed.\n\n**Core algorithm**:\n\n*   **Detection:** I'm going to start by identifying all the pixels of the target color. I can use this to detect horizontal and vertical segments.\n*   **Gap finding:** I need to find the segments on the same horizontal or vertical line (row or column) that have gaps.\n*   **Bridge Detection:** Then, for a pair of segments with a gap, I need to check if there are \"bridge\" pixels connecting them. Bridge pixels must meet these constraints: 1. Located in the row or column of the gap, 2. Close to the gap.\n*   **Merge and Repair:** If I do find bridge pixels, I'll merge the two segments by filling in the gap with the target color.\n*   **Clean Up:** Finally, I'll remove any \"noise\" pixels that aren't part of any line segments.\n\nFor bridge pixel determination, I'll project pixels near the gap onto the closest horizontal or vertical line to determine which pixels connect a line gap.\n\n**Let's test this with a Test Input**\nThe objective is the same, repair broken lines.\n\n*   **Test Input:** The Test Input (8 is the background and 9 is the target color). I see horizontal and vertical segments. I'll need to check the presence of gaps in those segments.\n    *   **Horizontal line at Row 14**: It has a gap at cols 10-12. This gap is in proximity of pixels at (11,12) and (12,11). Thus, fill Row 14 with 9 at columns 10-12.\n    *   **Vertical line at Col 6**: There's a diagonal \"noise\" (pixels not on the existing solid line, but aligned with gap). The goal should be to determine where does this line start and end?\n    *   (3,5), (4,4), (5,3) is a diagonal pattern near the vertical line at Col 6. It bridges an existing gap in Row 3. This means horizontal segments that have gaps at a location can be connected by the noise pixels.\n    *   This indicates the horizontal line segment at row 3 should be extended left, to fill the column 2-5 gap.\n    *   If that's the intention, the horizontal line should be drawn to connect the current 0,1 with the pixel at col 5. If this is a valid step, the goal of this rule is the ability to determine if two segments will connect, so they will connect.\n*   **Output Strategy:** Based on that logic, I can now construct the output. I'll start with the background color and add the target color as lines and noise as required.\n\nBased on the algorithm, these were the pixel adjustments I'll be implementing in a structured fashion:\n\n*   **Horizontal Line Row 3:** Extend from col 0 to col 6 (to connect the segments).\n*   **Horizontal Line Row 14:** Extend from col 0 to col 14 (to connect the segments).\n*   **Vertical Line Col 6:** Start at Row 3, and extend down to Row 14.\n*   **Vertical Line Col 14:** Start at Row 0, and extend to Row 28.\n*   **Remove Noise Pixels:** (15,2), (16,3), (4,4), (5,3),\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a \"clean\" grid of horizontal and vertical lines from a \"noisy\" input grid. The noise manifests as gaps in the lines and displaced pixels (debris) that seem to \"fall off\" or be misaligned from the main lines.\n\n**Transformation Logic:**\n1.  **Identify Potential Lines:** We look for rows and columns that contain segments of the foreground color (9 in the test case). In the test input, we identify:\n    *   A vertical line at Column 14 (extending nearly the full height).\n    *   A vertical line at Column 6 (roughly from Row 3 to Row 14).\n    *   A horizontal line at Row 3 (starting at the left).\n    *   A horizontal line at Row 14 (crossing the grid).\n\n2.  **Repair Gaps and Remove Noise:**\n    *   **Vertical Line at Column 14:** There is a gap at rows 21-22. In the input, we see pixels at (21, 15) and (22, 16). These are adjacent to the gap and form a diagonal pattern, suggesting they are displaced parts of the line. We fill the gap at (21, 14) and (22, 14) with color 9 and remove the displaced pixels.\n    *   **Horizontal Line at Row 14:** There is a gap at columns 10-12. In the input, pixels at (11, 12) and (12, 11) are present. These project into the gap columns and are vertically adjacent to the line, acting as a bridge between the segment 0-9 and the vertical line at 14. We fill the gap (10-12) on Row 14 and remove the noise. The line extends from col 0 to col 14.\n    *   **Horizontal Line at Row 3:** There is a segment at cols 0-1 and a single pixel at col 6 (part of the vertical line). There is a gap at cols 2-5. We find noise pixels at (3, 5), (4, 4), and (5, 3). These pixels bridge the gap spatially. Specifically, (3,5) is on the line, and the others form a diagonal pointing towards the start of the line. We fill the gap at cols 2-5 on Row 3 and remove the noise. This connects the horizontal line to the vertical line at col 6.\n    *   **Vertical Line at Column 6:** This line is well-defined from Row 3 to Row 14. There are noise pixels below Row 14 at (15, 2) and (16, 3), but they do not align with Col 6 and seem to be isolated drips from the horizontal line above. They are removed.\n\n3.  **Final Construction:**\n    *   Draw a solid vertical line at Col 14 from Row 0 to Row 28.\n    *   Draw a solid vertical line at Col 6 from Row 3 to Row 14.\n    *   Draw a solid horizontal line at Row 3 from Col 0 to Col 6.\n    *   Draw a solid horizontal line at Row 14 from Col 0 to Col 14.\n    *   All other pixels are the background color (8).\n\n**Output Grid:**\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_G>\n<REASONING_MODEL_H model_id=\"gemini-3-high_7_step_5_image\">\n**Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'm approaching this ARC task, laying out my reasoning and thought process step-by-step.**\n\nOkay, the user wants me to crack this image pattern. The goal is to transform one grid of numbers (representing colors) into another. I need to identify the pattern. I've been given one test example and two examples, so let's start with the first example.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI'm starting by looking at the visual details of the input grid. I see horizontal and vertical lines, with magenta (6) as the main color, on a blue (1) background. There are lines and dots of the color 6, plus some gaps. The output looks neater - the goal is to make a \"cleaner\" version. The vertical and horizontal lines have a strong presence. Any \"noise\" or diagonal pixels (like scatter) are gone. So, I need to see how they have changed. I compare the raw text to the visuals.\n\nNow, I start comparing specific rows and columns. I see that the color 6 pixels that start a vertical or horizontal line are preserved. Pixels that appear to be part of broken lines are removed. The gaps in lines are filled in. The vertical gap in row 7 shows that the single pixel at col 19 is removed.\n\nI notice that in the image the isolated pixel at, say, (3,19) is not part of a horizontal or vertical segment, and so the pixel is removed. I also notice a gap in the horizontal row 7, which goes from 6 to 14, and then from 18 to 20, with gaps. Then it appears to become a part of a vertical line. There is also a gap in the vertical line at col 14.\n\nAfter comparing the image and the text, I've got to formulate a hypothesis. I have the idea that \"remove noise (scattered/isolated pixels) and connect aligned segments/fill gaps in straight lines\".\n\nNow, I look at the connection logic: if segments are close (3 pixels apart in Ex1), the gap is filled in. If there are opposing segments or drifted pixels near a gap, the segments are joined. The diagonal pixels look like debris from the grid lines. The pixel at (3,19) is isolated, so it is removed. Then I look for isolated pixels. The pixels that are diagonally connected are removed.\n\nNow I look at the Ex 1 horizontal line at row 7, again. This is where I start thinking in terms of structure. In the example output, the pixels are connected, forming a T-junction at (7,14). I'm seeing the horizontal line segment joining the vertical segment at (7,14). So, the debris are an indicator.\n\nNow I think about the horizontal and vertical line connections: I look at the horizontal gap (15,16,17) and the vertical gap (10,11,12). I look to fill the gaps.\n\nI look at the broken segments (pixels from the input image) on either side. Now I can see the core logic: \"If there are segments that align and are close together, fill the gap and remove the noise. The drifted or diagonally aligned pixels are indicators of a shift.\"\n\nTo summarize: 1) Identify horizontal and vertical lines (that look like lines) and the direction of a change to correct. 2) Remove drifted pixels. 3) Fill gaps if they are close (small gaps) between collinear segments.\n\nNow I look at Example 2.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis**\n\nIn Example 2, the background is black and the foreground is green. Similar to Example 1, there are strong vertical lines and one horizontal line. I'm focusing on \"the middle\" structure and the pixels in the middle (where a gap is filled). In Example 2, the horizontal line (9) is where a point is filled, forming a connection to the vertical line at (9,23), in the example. So, it's not the length, or size of the gap, but its association with a clean vertical line in the input, which is key.\n\nExample 2 reinforces the idea of fixing drifted pixels. I focus on the gaps and the positions of pixels. The middle structure in Example 2 is made up of a bunch of segments. So, I verify by reading the output text. In Example 2, the horizontal line extends to the vertical line. I check for any pixels that are not aligned (drifted) with existing segments.\n\nBased on Example 2, the logic is: 1) Identify the lines. 2) Straighten up \"drifted\" pixels to be part of lines. 3) Correct the alignment and fill the gaps.\n\nLet's test this with\n\nThe problem asks us to identify a transformation rule from the given examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** We see a \"broken\" grid of magenta (6) lines on a blue (1) background. There are horizontal and vertical segments with gaps. There are also scattered \"noise\" pixels, often diagonally adjacent to the gaps or segment ends.\n    *   **Transformation:** The output shows clean, continuous horizontal and vertical lines.\n        *   Gaps in straight lines are filled (e.g., the gap in the horizontal line at row 7).\n        *   The scattered/diagonal pixels (noise) are removed.\n        *   The logic seems to be: Reconstruct the intended rectilinear grid lines. Segments that align are connected. \"Drifting\" pixels (pixels shifted by 1-2 steps from a main line) are hints to where the line exists and are used to verify the connection, then removed.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Green (3) lines on black (0). Similar broken segments and drifted pixels.\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   Vertical lines are repaired. Note that the leftmost vertical line (col 4) retains its large gaps because there is no evidence (debris/drifted pixels) to connect them, or the gaps are part of the pattern (dashed line). However, the vertical line on the right (col 18) and the middle one (col 11) are straightened and connected where appropriate.\n        *   A horizontal line is connected/extended.\n        *   Drifted pixels are removed.\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\n\n*   **Grid:** 29x17. Background color 8 (Teal). Pattern color 9 (Maroon).\n*   **Identified Structures (Intended Lines):**\n    1.  **Vertical Line (Right):** Located at **Column 14**.\n        *   Evidence: Continuous stream of 9s from Row 0 to 13, then at 14, 15-19, 23-25, 27-28.\n        *   Drifts/Debris: Pixels at `(20,15)` and `(21,16)` suggest the line drifted right.

You must output your thinking process inside <AUDIT_LOG> tags.\n\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\n- **Selection:** If a Candidate contains multiple <REASONING> blocks, read them all and select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation to audit.\n- **Crystallization:** Convert that text into a strict \"IF-THEN\" algorithm.\n  - *Bad:* \"The pattern involves moving blue pixels.\" (Too vague to audit)\n  - *Good:* \"IF a pixel is Blue, THEN move it 1 step Right. Else, preserve color.\"\n- *Constraint:* If the reasoning is incoherent or vague, mark the Candidate as \"INVALID - VAGUE\".\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT (CRITICAL)\n- You must \"Back-Test\" the Crystallized Rule against the {{SOLVED_EXAMPLES}}.\n- For **EACH** Solved Example pair (Input -> Output), you must strictly perform this 3-step check:\n  1. **Hypothesis:** \"If I apply the Candidate's Rule to this Input, exactly what *should* happen?\"\n  2. **Observation:** \"Look at the actual Official Output. What *actually* happened?\"\n  3. **Verdict:** \"Do they match?\"\n- **Fatal Contradictions to Watch For:**\n  * **Scope Error:** Rule applies to specific colors (e.g., \"Blue\"), but the example changes \"Red\" pixels.\n  * **Geometry Error:** Rule says \"rotate 90,\" but example shows a flip.\n  * **Object Error:** Rule treats pixels individually, but example shows objects moving as blocks.\n- *Constraint:* Record exactly how many Solved Examples the candidate PASSED vs FAILED. **Do not stop at the first failure**; check all examples to determine the severity of the failure (e.g., \"Passed 2/3 Examples\").\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n- For Candidates that survived Phase 2 (or passed at least one example):\n- Look at the {{TEST_INPUT}} and the Candidate's <PROPOSED_SOLUTION> grid.\n- Does the proposed output actually follow the Crystallized Rule?\n- *Common Hallucination:* The text says \"Move Blue,\" but the grid shows Blue staying still. Mark this as **INTERNAL_CONTRADICTION**.\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING & TIE-BREAKING\n- Rank ALL candidates from Best to Worst based on this hierarchy:\n  1. **GOLD (Tier 1):** Passed ALL Solved Examples + Consistent Execution on Test Input.\n  2. **SILVER (Tier 2):** Passed ALL Solved Examples + Minor Execution Error on Test Input.\n  3. **BRONZE (Tier 3):** Passed MOST Solved Examples (Partial Logic).\n  4. **INVALID (Tier 4):** Failed ALL/MOST Solved Examples, Vague Reasoning, or Severe Internal Contradictions.\n\n- **Tie-Breaking:** If two candidates are in the same Tier, rank the one with the **Simplest Rule** (Occam's Razor) higher.\n</AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\n\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfit\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",

transformation:\n1. **Identifies main line structures** (horizontal and vertical lines formed by the non-background color)\n2. **Removes diagonal deviations** - any cells that deviate diagonally from the main orthogonal lines are removed\n3. **Fills gaps in established lines** - where there are clear line segments that should be continuous, gaps are filled\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe background is 8, and the line color is 9.\n\n**Main structures identified:**\n1. **Column 14**: A vertical line running most of the height (rows 0-19, then 23-25, 27-28 with gaps)\n2. **Column 6**: A vertical line from rows 3-13\n3. **Row 14**: A horizontal line from columns 0-9, gap at 10-12, then 13-14\n4. **Row 3**: Segments at [0,1] and [6]\n\n**Diagonals to remove:**\n- Rows 3-5, cols 3-5:

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Transformation Strategy for ARC Task: \"Jagged to Straight\"**\n\nOkay, so the goal here is to transform these input grids, which are comprised of integers, into cleaner outputs. The examples are showing a pattern, and I need to figure it out. It's like taking a shaky line and making it straight, while keeping the main features.\n\nThe input grids seem to contain \"background\" (usually represented by 1 or 0) and \"foreground\" which are colored from 0 to 9. The main thing seems to be that those foreground numbers are creating lines, often with a \"staircase\" or jagged look. The task is to straighten those lines into Manhattan geometry which includes vertical and horizontal segments and 90 degree corners.\n\n**The Breakdown:**\n\nFirst, I need to look at each example and understand the changes between the input and output.\n\n*   **Example 1**: The main foreground number here is 6.  I need to follow the 6s across the input and the output. It's like they have two blobs of 6s, and a long jagged line that is somehow connecting them.\n    *   The \"jagged\" parts (diagonal segments) are replaced by straight vertical or horizontal lines, or by simply extending the existing segments.\n    *   The horizontal run is somehow connected to the vertical.\n    *   I'm seeing that if there is a small \"gap\" in a horizontal line, like three 1s in a row, they are filled if they're close enough to each other.\n    *   The \"hints\" give the main rule: jagged or diagonal runs disappear, and straight segments are preserved and sometimes extended to connect and form right angles. This is crucial.\n\n*   **Example 2**: Foreground number is 3.\n    *   There is a vertical line. There is a horizontal line. The \"jagged\" bits are making a kind of staircase connecting the vertical and the horizontal. In the Output, the jagged pixels are removed or incorporated in the nearest existing horizontal or vertical segment (extending the horizontal segment to the right or extending the vertical segment down to form a corner).\n    *   There's also some \"jagged\" stuff off to the side, not really connected to anything but the vertical line. The output, they simply extend the vertical line and remove the jagged bits.  The jagged stuff acts like a bridge and they fill in the connection, forming an L shape.\n    *   So, a straight segment can extend to clean up the connections. Or, jagged bits with no purpose are just deleted.\n    *   They're replacing the staircase with an L-shape if the segments are perpendicular and close enough or if they will overlap.\n\n**Forming a Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Structures**: The core of the strategy is to identify horizontal and vertical segments of the foreground numbers that have a length greater than 1, and this should form the rigid framework. These segments are the things you want to keep.\n2.  **Find the Tails**: Jagged \"tails\" or staircase pixels need to be identified next. These are either \"bridges\" between the existing segments or stand on their own.\n3.  **Process those Tails**. I'll follow these rules:\n\n    *   **Connections**: If a \"tail\" connects two straight segments, extend the segments to meet at the joint of the tail in the form of an L. The pixels in the stair case are removed.\n    *   **Dangling Tails**: if a straight segment has a dangling tail that is not connected to a new segment, extend the existing straight segment over to cover the tail.\n    *   **Gaps**: if two segments have close gaps, the gaps can be filled to remove the gap and connect them.\n\n**Applying the Plan**:\n\nSo here are the steps in action:\n\n1.  **Read the Input**: I need to examine the input grid thoroughly.\n2.  **Identify Straight Lines**: Find horizontal and vertical lines in the grid that have a length greater than 1.\n3.  **Find Tails**: Now look for the 1-pixel \"jumps\" that are attached to the existing straight lines, or those standing independently (these are \"tails\" or gaps).\n4.  **Connect or Fix**: Apply the rules of connection that I just developed.\n5.  **Remove Tail Pixels**: Delete or \"project\" these diagonal segments by extending the existing straight lines onto them. Fill in gaps between lines if they are close together.\n6.  **Output the result**: Put out the new transformed grid.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input**:\n\nNow, I'll need to apply this to the new test input and test it out. It's about finding the lines, tails and removing or extending those parts, making the outputs fit the plan. And double checking\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of integers representing colors. Based on the solved examples and the hints provided, the transformation rules can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.  **Rectilinear Geometry:** The transformation \"cleans up\" the foreground geometry (9s in the test input) by enforcing Manhattan geometry (horizontal and vertical lines only). Diagonal or \"staircase\" lines are removed or rectified.\n2.  **Preserve and Extend:** Existing straight vertical and horizontal segments are preserved. If a diagonal or irregular path connects two such segments (or suggests a continuation of one), the straight segments are extended to meet or cover the extent of the irregular path.\n3.  **Local Transformation:** Segments that are completely isolated and not part of a \"jagged\" connector structure remain unchanged.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\n\n*   **Top Left (Rows 3):** There is a small horizontal segment `9,9` at `(R3, C0-C1)`. It is separated from the rest of the structure by a gap of background pixels. As an isolated straight segment, it is preserved.\n*   **Vertical Line at C6:** There is a vertical segment of 9s at Column 6, running from Row 3 to Row 13.\n    *   There is a diagonal \"tail\" attached to the top of this line (pixels at `(R3, C5)`, `(R4, C4)`, `(R5, C3)`). Since this tail does not connect to another structure and extending the vertical line doesn't make sense (it's already there), the tail is removed.\n    *   This vertical line meets the horizontal line at Row 14.\n*   **Horizontal Line at R14:** There is a horizontal segment of 9s at Row 14, spanning Columns 0 to 9.\n    *   This line connects cleanly with the vertical line at C6.\n    *   There is a diagonal \"tail\" attached to the bottom of this line (pixels at `(R15, C2)`, `(R16, C3)`). This tail is removed.\n*   **Vertical Line at C14:** There is a vertical structure at Column 14.\n    *   It exists from Row 0 to Row 19, and then from Row 23 to Row 28.\n    *   There is a gap and a jagged deviation at Rows 20-22 (pixels at `(R20, C15)`, `(R21, C16)`).\n    *   To rectify this, the vertical line at C14 is made continuous from Row 0 to Row 28, and the jagged pixels at C15/C16 are removed.\n*   **Connecting the Structures (The Bridge):**\n    *   There are floating diagonal pixels at `(R11, C12)` and `(R12, C11)`. These sit between the end of the horizontal line (R14, C9) and the vertical line (C14).\n    *   This pattern implies a connection. Following the rule of extending straight segments to replace jagged connectors, we extend the horizontal line at Row 14 to the right until it intersects the vertical line at Column 14.\n    *   This fills `(R14, C10)`, `(R14, C11)`, `(R14, C12)` and connects to the vertical line at `(R14, C14)`. The floating pixels are removed.\n\n**Final Shape Construction:**\n*   **Background:** All 8s.\n*   **Foreground (9s):**\n    *   `R3, C0-1` (Isolated block).\n    *   `Col 6` from `Row 3` to `Row 13`.\n    *   `Col 14` from `Row 0` to `Row 28`.\n    *   `Row 14` from `Col 0` to `Col 14`.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n

**diagonal \u201cstair steps\u201d** (pixels only touching other 9s diagonally).  \nFrom the solved examples, the fix is:\n\n1. **Classify 9-cells**\n   - \u201cStraight\u201d cells: have at least one **orthogonal** (up/down/left/right) 9-neighbor.\n   - \u201cDiagonal-only\u201d cells: have **no orthogonal** 9-neighbor, but have at least one **diagonal** 9-neighbor.\n\n2. **For each diagonal-only diagonal component**\n   - If it touches a straight segment diagonally, **project it onto that segment**:\n     - If the touching straight segment is **horizontal**, move the diagonal cells onto that **row** (keep their columns).\n     - If it\u2019s **vertical**, move them onto that **column** (keep their rows).\n   - If it does **not** touch any straight segment, **remove it** (it\u2019s isolated diagonal noise).\n\n3. **Close 1-cell gaps**: whenever there is a pattern `9,8,9` in a row or column, fill the middle cell to 9.\n\nApplied to the test:\n- The diagonal `(5,5)-(6,4)` attaches (diagonally) to the horizontal segment on row 4, so it is projected to `(4,5)` and `(4,4)`, and then `(4,3)` is filled as a 1-cell gap.\n- The diagonal pair `(12,13)-(13,12)` is isolated, so it is removed.\n- `(17,4)` projects onto the vertical segment in column 3, becoming `(17,3)`.\n- The bottom-right stair `(21,16)-(22,17)` projects onto the big vertical line in column 15, becoming `(21,15)` and `(22,15)`.\n- Then the single gaps in column 15 at rows 23 and 27 are filled, making column 15 continuous.\n\nFinal output

non\u2011background color).  \nIn the examples, the line drawings are meant to be **purely horizontal/vertical**, but the input contains small \u201cstaircase\u201d **diagonal artifacts** (pixels that touch the drawing only diagonally). The output \u201corthogonalizes\u201d the drawing:\n\n1. **Find the background and line color**\n   - Background = most frequent color.\n   - Line color = the other color.\n\n2. **Detect diagonal-only pixels**\n   - A line-color cell is a *diagonal artifact* if:\n     - it has **no 4-neighbors** (up/down/left/right) of the line color, **and**\n     - it has at least one **diagonal neighbor** (one of the 4 diagonals) of the line color.\n   - These pixels form diagonal \u201cchains\u201d via diagonal adjacency.\n\n3. **Snap each diagonal chain onto the straight line it is attached to**\n   - For each diagonal chain, look for any **non-diagonal** line-color cell that touches the chain **diagonally** (this is the \u201canchor\u201d).\n   -

Let's dig in. It seems the input consists of grids with background and foreground colors, and the goal is to transform these grids in some way.\n\n**Example 1: Hypothesis Formation**\n\nI'm starting by analyzing the first example, focusing on identifying patterns and changes between the input and output. The background color in example one is blue (`1`), and the shapes are magenta (`6`). I'm looking for distinct shapes, like lines and connected components. I'm noting specific coordinates of the magenta pixels. There are both vertical and horizontal lines of color `6`. It appears there are \"gaps\" in the lines. I then compare the input and output, noting a specific row as an interesting point of analysis. It looks like the output merges segments from the input when there is a short gap between them. Hmm, the rule might involve \"healing\" broken lines.  I start to hypothesize that removing \"noise\" pixels that don't belong to any apparent lines and completing the existing lines is crucial. This leads me to examine how \"broken\" lines (lines with gaps) are being treated and what constitutes a \"valid\" line.\n\n**Example 1: Rule Refinement**\n\nThe exploration continues by looking at isolated pixels, determining their characteristics and how they are handled. I look at different horizontal and vertical lines, with varying lengths and gaps, in search of more details of the process. I identify \"objects\" and try to determine the rule for merging or splitting lines.  A pattern emerges: isolated, single-pixel segments are removed. However, to fill a gap, there might have to be alignment or intersecting perpendicular lines. It seems short segments are removed but longer segments are kept, but now I'm trying to figure out if there is a threshold, or if they need to be connected to a larger segment. I formulate a hypothesis that combines removing noise (isolated pixels) and completing lines (merging segments with small gaps). It looks like the logic involves identifying horizontal and vertical line structures.\n\n**Example 2: Rule Validation and Adjustment**\n\nI then shift my focus to the second example to test my hypothesis. The foreground color is green (`3`). There's a set of \"dots\", potentially part of some underlying structure. Now I start to see \"shifted\" or \"diagonal\" pixels, which might be noise. There is a lot of noise removal and line completion going on. From this, the rule is forming more clearly. It seems there is a \"snap to grid\" effect, where diagonal or out-of-line pixels move to align to the horizontal or vertical lines. I refine my understanding of the noise removal and how this affects the grid. I test the idea of filtering out the noise by removing the pixel if it has no horizontal or vertical neighbors.\n\n**Synthesis and Test Input Analysis**\n\nWith these examples, I now have a solid grip on the task. I hypothesize that the task is \"Repair Lines\" or \"Snap to Grid\".\nThe process is:\n\n1.  Noise Removal.\n2.  Gap Filling (for short gaps only).\n\nThe test input contains teal background (`8`) and maroon foreground (`9`). There are vertical and horizontal lines in a pattern that is more complex than the examples. I now construct a map of where the pixels are. I map out the coordinates of the 9s. I see that the pixels are both noisy and can form structured shapes. I then determine the best method for removing noise and filling gaps. I start formulating the code to deal with all the rules. The pixels look like a construction, so I draw out the \"main\" lines.\n\n**Construction and Solution**\n\nThe task now becomes an exercise in identifying the line segments, drawing out where they should be, and using a loop to filter and fill in any gaps or noise. I finalize the rules and go through the Test Input one final time to verify that my analysis is correct. It all looks perfect! With my rules in place, I can construct the final output. The main structural lines are vertical line at x=14 from y=0 to y=28, horizontal line y=14 from x=0 to x=14, vertical line at x=6, y=3..14, and horizontal line at y=3 from x=0 to x=6. I am now confident about constructing the output matrix. I have completely validated my approach and generated the output.\n\n\n\nThe problem asks us to infer a transformation rule from two examples and apply it to a test input. The grids contain integer values representing colors.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains horizontal and vertical lines of color `6` (magenta) on a background of `1` (blue). The lines have gaps (missing pixels) and there is \"noise\" (isolated pixels scattered diagonally).\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   **Noise Removal:** Isolated pixels that do not form part of the main horizontal or vertical lines are removed (e.g., pixels at (3,19), (8,17), etc.).\n        *   **Gap Filling:** Gaps in the lines are filled. For instance, in Row 7, a gap of 3 pixels between two segments was filled to create a continuous line. Note that not all gaps are filled; specifically, gaps crossed by a perpendicular line *terminating* at the gap (like the gap at Row 7, Cols 3-5 crossed by the vertical line at Col 4) might remain. However, gaps that simply connect segments of a single line are filled.\n    *   **Output:** Clean, continuous lines forming a cohesive structure.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains broken lines of color `3` (green) on `0` (black). It also contains \"shifted\" pixels (e.g., in column 18, some pixels are at 19 or 20).\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   **Line Repair:** The vertical line at Column 18 is repaired. The shifted pixels are removed, and the gap in the column is filled.\n        *   **Gap Filling:** A horizontal gap in Row 9 is filled.\n    *   **Output:** Continuous vertical and horizontal lines.\n\n**Logic Applied to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Background:** `8` (teal).\n*   **Foreground:** `9` (maroon).\n*   **Identify Structures:**\n    *   **Vertical Line (Column 14):** The input has a nearly continuous line in column 14 from row 0 to 19, then shifted pixels in rows 20-21, a gap in 22, segments in 23-25 and 27-28. Following the logic, we treat this as a single continuous vertical line spanning the full height (Rows 0-28). The shifted pixels (noise) are removed, and the gaps are filled.\n    *   **Vertical Line (Column 6):** The input shows a clear vertical segment in column 6 from Row 3 to Row 13.\n    *   **Horizontal Line (Row 14):** There is a segment from Col 0 to 9, a gap at 10-12, and a segment at 13-14. This gap connects the left segment to the vertical spine at Col 14. We fill this gap to form a line from Col 0 to 14.\n    *   **Horizontal Line (Row 3):** There is a segment at Col 0-1, a gap at 2-4, and a segment at 5-6.

It's all about two colors, a background and a foreground. I can see the pattern already, the key lies in understanding how the foreground elements change from the input to the output.\n\n**Analyzing the Clues**\n\n*   **Color Identification:** First step is to quickly recognize what's foreground and what's background in the examples and the test input (1-6 in Example 1, 0-3 in Example 2, 8-9 in the test case).\n\n*   **Identifying the Patterns:** Looking at the solved examples, I immediately see lines \u2013 vertical, horizontal, some diagonals \u2013 made with the foreground color (6s in Example 1, 3s in Example 2).\n\n**First Observation - The \"Jaggedness\" of the Connections**\n\n*   **Initial Thought:** I focus on the \"jagged\" connections between straight horizontal or vertical segments, these need straightening. I see \"gaps\" and \"diagonal runs\" that are connected, so I suspect that those connections will be changed to straight.\n\n*   **Example 1 Insights:** In Example 1, there's a horizontal line with a gap, and a diagonal \"bridge\" below it, it's clear the output \"straightens\" that. My hint: *\"Jagged/staircase (diagonal-looking) runs disappear in the output.\"*\n\n*   **Key Insight:** Okay, the pattern is: *\"Identify jagged diagonal connections between straight segments. Replace the jagged path with a straight line (extension of the existing straight segments) to connect them.\"* This is my main hypothesis. It works by extending existing lines to bridge connections.\n\n**Building the Strategy - General Algorithm**\n\n*   **Step 1:** Recognize the foreground \"objects\" or patterns as connected components.\n*   **Step 2:** Within each object, Identify straight horizontal or vertical lines. These are what I am extending.\n*   **Step 3:** Now, identify jagged parts (diagonal lines) that connect the segments.\n*   **Step 4:** If two points A and B are part of a jagged connection:\n    *   If A and B are in the same row, make a straight horizontal line between them.\n    *   If A and B are in the same column, draw a vertical line.\n    *   If neither, the hint says, \"extend\" the existing lines.\n\n**Testing Hypothesis**\n\n*   **Example 2 Validation:** I check Example 2 to make sure that rule works in a new setting. It has the same behaviour: Diagonals are being replaced by straight vertical lines or the extension of existing vertical lines.\n*   **Example Verification:** I re-examine Example 1 for a detailed understanding of how each diagonal \"jagged\" bit disappears and how it is replaced by an \"extension.\"\n*   **Edge Case Analysis:** The \"drifts\" from vertical to diagonal back to vertical lines were analyzed, to check that it extends the straightest parts. The hint \"straight horizontal/vertical segments are preserved\" shows the behaviour of extending one over another.\n\n**Putting Theory into Practice - The Test Input**\n\n*   **Test Input Scrutiny:** I meticulously look at the test input. It's critical to identify all the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments.\n*   **Identifying Patterns**: I'm on the lookout for vertical line, horizontal lines, and the places where segments are *not* directly connected (gaps) as these are the place where the \"transformation\" will happen.\n*   **The Structure is Clear** : Once all the inputs are analysed I can see the whole structure. I see where to fill the gaps.\n\n**Challenges and Adaptations**\n\n*   **Sprout Analysis**: There's a particular issue with diagonal \"dangles\" or \"sprouts\" that aren't connecting anything. I have to interpret if this is just noise or part of some intentional construction. The hypothesis is: *If the diagonal segment is \"disappeared\", and there is no straight segment to extend *over* it...Then maybe it just disappears.* I choose to remove these dangling diagonal pieces.\n\n*   **Edge Extension:** I verify if there are any edges on which the diagonal segments have to stop. I use the hint about vertical extension, I choose to extend vertical lines to the end of the image.\n\n**Final Touches**\n\n*   **Algorithm Refinement:** Review the logic: the goal is to make a \"clean\" grid with right-angle junctions.\n*   **Double Check Every Pixel:** Before converting to an output grid, I go over every change, confirming everything.\n*   **Ensure it has the correct size\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the examples. The examples show a \"rectification\" process where jagged, diagonal, or disconnected lines of the foreground color are replaced by clean, straight horizontal and vertical lines. Specifically:\n- **Jagged/Diagonal Lines Disappear:** Any sequence of pixels moving diagonally (staircase pattern) is removed or replaced.\n- **Straight Segments are Preserved and Extended:** Existing vertical and horizontal segments are kept. If two segments are connected by a jagged line (or clearly meant to connect), they are extended to meet at a right angle, filling the gap.\n- **Connectivity:** The goal is to create a clean, rectilinear circuit or structure that maintains the connectivity implied by the original \"messy\" input.\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\nThe input grid (29 rows, 17 columns) contains a background of 8 and a foreground of 9. We identify the following structures:\n\n1.  **Vertical Line at Column 14:**\n    - There is a strong vertical line of 9s in column 14 appearing in rows 0-19, 23-25, and 27-28.\n    - There is a \"drift\" or jagged break in rows 20-21 where the pixels shift to columns 15 and 16.\n    - There are gaps in rows 22 and 26.\n    - **Action:** Restore the vertical line at column 14 to be continuous from the top (row 0) to the bottom (row 28). The drifting pixels are removed, and the gaps are filled to create a single solid vertical bar.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Line at Row 3 (Top Left):**\n    - There are 9s at `(3,0), (3,1)` and `(3,5), (3,6)`.\n    - A jagged diagonal sequence `(3,5), (4,4), (5,3)` appears to bridge the gap between the left segment and the vertical structure at column 6.\n    - **Action:** The intended structure is a straight horizontal line at row 3 connecting the left edge to column 6. We fill the segment from column 0 to column 6 with 9s. The diagonal artifacts `(4,4)` and `(5,3)` are removed.\n\n3.  **Vertical Line at Column 6 (Top Middle):**\n    - There is a solid vertical line of 9s in column 6 from row 3 down to row 13.\n    - **Action:** Preserve this line. It connects the top horizontal line (row 3) to the bottom horizontal line (row 14).\n\n4.  **Horizontal Line at Row 14 (Middle):**\n    - There is a horizontal line of 9s from column 0 to column 9, and then at columns 13 and 14.\n    - There is a gap at columns 10, 11, 12.\n    - Jagged pixels at `(11,12)` and `(12,11)` exist in the \"corner\" formed by this line and the vertical line at column 14.\n    - **Action:** Fill the horizontal line at row 14 continuously from column 0 to column 14. This creates a clean junction with the vertical line at column 14. The jagged pixels are removed.\n\n5.  **Diagonal \"Sprout\" at `(15,2), (16,3)`:**\n    - These pixels form a diagonal tail coming off the horizontal line at row 14.\n    - Unlike the other structures, this does not connect two existing segments. In Example 2, a dangling diagonal was turned into a vertical line extending to the edge. However, in this specific case, the diagonal is very short (2 pixels) and does not align with any vertical structure above it.

We have two example input-output pairs to guide us, and I need to figure out the underlying logic.\n\nFirstly, I'm identifying the key features: the background and foreground colors (0, 1, 8, and 3, 6, 9 respectively), and the \"noisy\" nature of the foreground lines. My main aim is to create clean, continuous lines, eliminating any jitter or gaps. I'm focusing on vertical and horizontal lines primarily.\n\nLooking at Example 1, I'm analyzing the pixel coordinates to trace the structures. I'm tracking the behavior of pixels near the expected line positions. Key is: Pixels deviating from a clear vertical line (like in column 14) are not part of the output, while ones in a group or close to the line are treated as valid for its extension. These deviating pixels are effectively moved to straighten the line. Also, I'm checking gap filling: small gaps (size 3) are merged within an otherwise contiguous line. I am investigating why some gaps are filled and some are not.\n\nIn Example 2, I'm trying to see if I can generalize. I'm taking notes on situations where pixels are removed or kept. For example, vertical line segments with only a few connected foreground pixels are removed, while longer, connected segments are retained, even if there are small gaps. Gap filling also has different behaviours in these two examples.\n\nI hypothesize that the algorithm detects lines using density-based thresholding, straightens them, and fills small gaps *within* those lines. The removal of 'noisy' pixels seems to depend on their proximity to a \"main line\" - pixels near the line, even if slightly offset, are \"snapped\" to it, and pixels far away from any strong line are removed as noise. In Ex. 2, `(9,23)` is close to another horizontal segment and got merged, while the diagonal `(17,19), (18,18), (19,17)` at the bottom-right became empty because they had no valid vertical or horizontal neighbors. The goal seems to be the simplification of the visual structure into solid vertical/horizontal lines.\n\nI refined this understanding to the following strategy: 1) Identify rows and columns where there are a significant number of foreground pixels, and use these as the main lines. \"Significant\" depends on the grid sizes. 2) Snap any pixel within a small distance (say, 1 or 2 pixels, depending on examples) of a detected line to it. Pixels that do not \"snap\" or have no neighbor lines are discarded. 3) For each line, plot the snapped pixels to create the cleaned version of the line. The final step is gap filling: any small internal gaps (say of 1- or 2-pixel width) within the constructed lines are filled.\n\nNow, I'm ready to apply this to the test input. First, I'm checking for vertical and horizontal lines using pixel counts to define the coordinates to form lines. The goal is to make the code flexible to the varying pixel counts. Then, I need to translate all this into a step-by-step procedure to convert the test input. This includes: Identifying pixels to snap (those closest to the main lines), filling gaps and finally rendering the corrected grid. I'm applying what I've learned to the test input and checking the logic. I am also carefully checking the distance constraints and gap thresholds based on the existing examples.\n\nI am now in the stage of building the output from scratch, where I will define foreground or background pixels given the above strategy.\n\nI have found lines at rows 3 and 14, and columns 6 and 14. I identified a \"wobbly\" line structure along columns 15 to 16. I am now at the stage of analyzing how those elements are affected by the straightening strategy. I am at the pixel level now.\n\nBy applying the steps, pixels not fitting on one of the lines will become part of the background. I confirmed that vertical lines span from the top to bottom. Horizontal lines span from the left to right of the grid. All the logic is implemented to deal with any situation with the test case to generate the output grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to perform a \"line repair\" transformation on the grid. Based on the provided examples, the logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Structure**: Detect dominant vertical and horizontal lines in the grid. A line is defined by a row or column containing a significant number of foreground pixels (color 9).\n    *   **Vertical Lines**: Scanning the columns, we see a strong vertical presence in **Column 14** (index 14) running the full height, and **Column 6** running from the top horizontal line to the bottom one.\n    *   **Horizontal Lines**: Scanning the rows, we see a strong horizontal presence in **Row 14** (spanning the left side) and **Row 3** (spanning the top left).\n\n2.  **Snap & Straighten**: Deviated or \"jittery\" pixels that are near a dominant line (within a distance of 1 or 2 pixels) are \"snapped\" onto that line.\n    *   **Around Horizontal Line Row 3**: Pixels at `(4,4)` and `(5,3)` are misaligned segments of this line. `(4,4)` is distance 1 from Row 3, so it snaps to `(3,4)`. `(5,3)` is distance 2 from Row 3, so it snaps to `(3,3)`.\n    *   **Around Horizontal Line Row 14**: Pixels at `(15,2)` and `(16,3)` are noise below the line. `(15,2)` snaps to `(14,2)`. `(16,3)` snaps to `(14,3)`. The pixel at `(12,11)` is distance 2 from Row 14 and distance 5 from Col 6, so it snaps to `(14,11)`.\n    *   **Around Vertical Line Col 14**: The pixel at `(11,12)` is distance 2 from Col 14, so it snaps to `(11,14)`. The deviated segment at the bottom `(20,15)` and `(21,16)` snaps back to the line at `(20,14)` and `(21,14)`.\n\n3.  **Fill Gaps**: After snapping, small gaps in the confirmed lines are filled to create continuous segments.\n    *   **Row 3**: After snapping, we have pixels at 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6. The gap at index 2 is size 1, so it is filled. The line becomes continuous from **0 to 6**. There is also a pixel at 14, but the gap (7-13) is too large to fill, so it remains separate.\n    *   **Row 14**: The line spans 0-9 originally. Snapping `(12,11)` to `(14,11)` creates a pixel at 11. Gaps at 10 and 12 are size 1, so they are filled. The original pixels at 13, 14 connect. The line becomes continuous from **0 to 14**.\n    *   **Col 6**: Runs from Row 3 to Row 14.\n    *   **Col 14**: Runs from Row 0 to Row 28. Snapping fills the hole at rows 20-21, and the single gap at row 22 is filled.\n\n4.  **Clean Up**: Any foreground pixel that was moved (snapped) or did not belong to a reconstructed line is removed (set to background color 8).\n\n**Final Object Reconstruction:**\n*   **Background**: 8\n*   **Col 14**: Solid 9 from Row 0 to 28.\n*   **Col 6**: Solid 9 from Row 3 to 14.\n*   **Row 14**: Solid 9 from Col 0 to 14.\n*   **Row 3**: Solid 9 from Col 0 to 6, plus the intersection at Col 14.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"F\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_12_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred rule (from the examples)\n\n- The grid has one **background** color (most frequent) and one **foreground** color that forms **axis-aligned (horizontal/vertical) lines**.\n- The task is to **repair** the line drawing:\n  1. **Identify the main intended rows/columns** for lines (the \u201cdominant\u201d row for a horizontal, or column for a vertical) by where the foreground pixels mostly lie.\n  2. **Snap nearby misaligned pixels** onto those dominant rows/columns (e.g., a pixel a couple of cells off a vertical line is moved onto that column).\n  3. **Fill gaps** inside each resulting straight line segment to make it continuous.\n  4. **Delete leftover pixels** that aren\u2019t part of any straight repaired line.\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n- Background is **8**, foreground (line color) is **9**.\n- The strongest line is the **vertical line in column 15**.  \n  - The two misaligned pixels at **(row21,col16)** and **(row22,col17)** get snapped back onto **col15**.\n  - Then the remaining internal gaps on col15 (rows **23** and **27**) are filled, making **col15 a continuous vertical line**.\n- There is also a clear **vertical line at column 7** from **row 4 to row 15**.\n- Row **4** shows two pieces of a horizontal line (cols 1\u20132 and cols 6\u20137) plus nearby \u201cstaircased\u201d pixels below;

My initial hypothesis is that it's about straightening out messy lines that have unwanted pixel noise, or maybe filling in gaps in lines that appear to be intentionally designed. I've already scrutinized two examples:\n\n**Example 1**: The input is filled with messy, broken segments of magenta (color 6), and the desired output is a cleaned-up version of those segments into horizontal and vertical lines. I saw that diagonal segments got removed, short segments got eliminated, and the broken segments got connected.\n\n**Example 2**: I observed a similar \"straightening\" process but in black/green color scheme (background 0 and target color 3). The aim seems to be connecting a broken vertical line in the middle to the right side and cleaning up some of the diagonal noise pixels.\n\nSo, the basic task is to create a \"repaired\" version of the image. The line that should be continuous would be the one that is the longest, i.e., has the most number of contiguous pixels. Gaps in the target line would be bridged by nearby \"noise\" pixels. The noise pixels would be removed.\n\n**Core algorithm**:\n\n*   **Detection:** I'm going to start by identifying all the pixels of the target color. I can use this to detect horizontal and vertical segments.\n*   **Gap finding:** I need to find the segments on the same horizontal or vertical line (row or column) that have gaps.\n*   **Bridge Detection:** Then, for a pair of segments with a gap, I need to check if there are \"bridge\" pixels connecting them. Bridge pixels must meet these constraints: 1. Located in the row or column of the gap, 2. Close to the gap.\n*   **Merge and Repair:** If I do find bridge pixels, I'll merge the two segments by filling in the gap with the target color.\n*   **Clean Up:** Finally, I'll remove any \"noise\" pixels that aren't part of any line segments.\n\nFor bridge pixel determination, I'll project pixels near the gap onto the closest horizontal or vertical line to determine which pixels connect a line gap.\n\n**Let's test this with a Test Input**\nThe objective is the same, repair broken lines.\n\n*   **Test Input:** The Test Input (8 is the background and 9 is the target color). I see horizontal and vertical segments. I'll need to check the presence of gaps in those segments.\n    *   **Horizontal line at Row 14**: It has a gap at cols 10-12. This gap is in proximity of pixels at (11,12) and (12,11). Thus, fill Row 14 with 9 at columns 10-12.\n    *   **Vertical line at Col 6**: There's a diagonal \"noise\" (pixels not on the existing solid line, but aligned with gap). The goal should be to determine where does this line start and end?\n    *   (3,5), (4,4), (5,3) is a diagonal pattern near the vertical line at Col 6. It bridges an existing gap in Row 3. This means horizontal segments that have gaps at a location can be connected by the noise pixels.\n    *   This indicates the horizontal line segment at row 3 should be extended left, to fill the column 2-5 gap.\n    *   If that's the intention, the horizontal line should be drawn to connect the current 0,1 with the pixel at col 5. If this is a valid step, the goal of this rule is the ability to determine if two segments will connect, so they will connect.\n*   **Output Strategy:** Based on that logic, I can now construct the output. I'll start with the background color and add the target color as lines and noise as required.\n\nBased on the algorithm, these were the pixel adjustments I'll be implementing in a structured fashion:\n\n*   **Horizontal Line Row 3:** Extend from col 0 to col 6 (to connect the segments).\n*   **Horizontal Line Row 14:** Extend from col 0 to col 14 (to connect the segments).\n*   **Vertical Line Col 6:** Start at Row 3, and extend down to Row 14.\n*   **Vertical Line Col 14:** Start at Row 0, and extend to Row 28.\n*   **Remove Noise Pixels:** (15,2), (16,3), (4,4), (5,3),\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a \"clean\" grid of horizontal and vertical lines from a \"noisy\" input grid. The noise manifests as gaps in the lines and displaced pixels (debris) that seem to \"fall off\" or be misaligned from the main lines.\n\n**Transformation Logic:**\n1.  **Identify Potential Lines:** We look for rows and columns that contain segments of the foreground color (9 in the test case). In the test input, we identify:\n    *   A vertical line at Column 14 (extending nearly the full height).\n    *   A vertical line at Column 6 (roughly from Row 3 to Row 14).\n    *   A horizontal line at Row 3 (starting at the left).\n    *   A horizontal line at Row 14 (crossing the grid).\n\n2.  **Repair Gaps and Remove Noise:**\n    *   **Vertical Line at Column 14:** There is a gap at rows 21-22. In the input, we see pixels at (21, 15) and (22, 16). These are adjacent to the gap and form a diagonal pattern, suggesting they are displaced parts of the line. We fill the gap at (21, 14) and (22, 14) with color 9 and remove the displaced pixels.\n    *   **Horizontal Line at Row 14:** There is a gap at columns 10-12. In the input, pixels at (11, 12) and (12, 11) are present. These project into the gap columns and are vertically adjacent to the line, acting as a bridge between the segment 0-9 and the vertical line at 14. We fill the gap (10-12) on Row 14 and remove the noise. The line extends from col 0 to col 14.\n    *   **Horizontal Line at Row 3:** There is a segment at cols 0-1 and a single pixel at col 6 (part of the vertical line). There is a gap at cols 2-5. We find noise pixels at (3, 5), (4, 4), and (5, 3). These pixels bridge the gap spatially. Specifically, (3,5) is on the line, and the others form a diagonal pointing towards the start of the line. We fill the gap at cols 2-5 on Row 3 and remove the noise. This connects the horizontal line to the vertical line at col 6.\n    *   **Vertical Line at Column 6:** This line is well-defined from Row 3 to Row 14. There are noise pixels below Row 14 at (15, 2) and (16, 3), but they do not align with Col 6 and seem to be isolated drips from the horizontal line above.

The goal is to transform one grid of numbers (representing colors) into another. I need to identify the pattern. I've been given one test example and two examples, so let's start with the first example.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI'm starting by looking at the visual details of the input grid. I see horizontal and vertical lines, with magenta (6) as the main color, on a blue (1) background. There are lines and dots of the color 6, plus some gaps. The output looks neater - the goal is to make a \"cleaner\" version. The vertical and horizontal lines have a strong presence. Any \"noise\" or diagonal pixels (like scatter) are gone. So, I need to see how they have changed. I compare the raw text to the visuals.\n\nNow, I start comparing specific rows and columns. I see that the color 6 pixels that start a vertical or horizontal line are preserved. Pixels that appear to be part of broken lines are removed. The gaps in lines are filled in. The vertical gap in row 7 shows that the single pixel at col 19 is removed.\n\nI notice that in the image the isolated pixel at, say, (3,19) is not part of a horizontal or vertical segment, and so the pixel is removed. I also notice a gap in the horizontal row 7, which goes from 6 to 14, and then from 18 to 20, with gaps. Then it appears to become a part of a vertical line. There is also a gap in the vertical line at col 14.\n\nAfter comparing the image and the text, I've got to formulate a hypothesis. I have the idea that \"remove noise (scattered/isolated pixels) and connect aligned segments/fill gaps in straight lines\".\n\nNow, I look at the connection logic: if segments are close (3 pixels apart in Ex1), the gap is filled in. If there are opposing segments or drifted pixels near a gap, the segments are joined. The diagonal pixels look like debris from the grid lines. The pixel at (3,19) is isolated, so it is removed. Then I look for isolated pixels. The pixels that are diagonally connected are removed.\n\nNow I look at the Ex 1 horizontal line at row 7, again. This is where I start thinking in terms of structure. In the example output, the pixels are connected, forming a T-junction at (7,14). I'm seeing the horizontal line segment joining the vertical segment at (7,14). So, the debris are an indicator.\n\nNow I think about the horizontal and vertical line connections: I look at the horizontal gap (15,16,17) and the vertical gap (10,11,12). I look to fill the gaps.\n\nI look at the broken segments (pixels from the input image) on either side. Now I can see the core logic: \"If there are segments that align and are close together, fill the gap and remove the noise. The drifted or diagonally aligned pixels are indicators of a shift.\"\n\nTo summarize: 1) Identify horizontal and vertical lines (that look like lines) and the direction of a change to correct. 2) Remove drifted pixels. 3) Fill gaps if they are close (small gaps) between collinear segments.\n\nNow I look at Example 2.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis**\n\nIn Example 2, the background is black and the foreground is green. Similar to Example 1, there are strong vertical lines and one horizontal line. I'm focusing on \"the middle\" structure and the pixels in the middle (where a gap is filled). In Example 2, the horizontal line (9) is where a point is filled, forming a connection to the vertical line at (9,23), in the example. So, it's not the length, or size of the gap, but its association with a clean vertical line in the input, which is key.\n\nExample 2 reinforces the idea of fixing drifted pixels. I focus on the gaps and the positions of pixels. The middle structure in Example 2 is made up of a bunch of segments. So, I verify by reading the output text. In Example 2, the horizontal line extends to the vertical line. I check for any pixels that are not aligned (drifted) with existing segments.\n\nBased on Example 2, the logic is: 1) Identify the lines. 2) Straighten up \"drifted\" pixels to be part of lines. 3) Correct the alignment and fill the gaps.\n\nLet's test this with\n\nThe problem asks us to identify a transformation rule from the given examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** We see a \"broken\" grid of magenta (6) lines on a blue (1) background. There are horizontal and vertical segments with gaps. There are also scattered \"noise\" pixels, often diagonally adjacent to the gaps or segment ends.\n    *   **Transformation:** The output shows clean, continuous horizontal and vertical lines.\n        *   Gaps in straight lines are filled (e.g., the gap in the horizontal line at row 7).\n        *   The scattered/diagonal pixels (noise) are removed.\n        *   The logic seems to be: Reconstruct the intended rectilinear grid lines. Segments that align are connected. \"Drifting\" pixels (pixels shifted by 1-2 steps from a main line) are hints to where the line exists and are used to verify the connection, then removed.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Green (3) lines on black (0). Similar broken segments and drifted pixels.\n    *   **Transformation:**\n        *   Vertical lines are repaired. Note that the leftmost vertical line (col 4) retains its large gaps because there is no evidence (debris/drifted pixels) to connect them, or the gaps are part of the pattern (dashed line). However, the vertical line on the right (col 18) and the middle one (col 11) are straightened and connected where appropriate.\n        *   A horizontal line is connected/extended.\n        *   Drifted pixels are removed.\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\n\n*   **Grid:** 29x17. Background color 8 (Teal). Pattern color 9 (Maroon).\n*   **Identified Structures (Intended Lines):**\n    1.  **Vertical Line (Right):** Located at **Column 14**.\n        *   Evidence: Continuous stream of 9s from Row 0 to 13, then at 14, 15-19, 23-25, 27-28.\n        *   Drifts/Debris: Pixels at `(20,15)` and `(21,16)` suggest the line drifted right. Gap at row 22 and 26.\n        *   Action: Create a continuous vertical line at Column 14 from Row 0 to Row 28.\n\n    2.  **Horizontal Line (Bottom):** Located at **Row 14**.\n        *   Evidence: Segment `0-9` and `13-14`.\n        *   Gap: Columns `10-12`.\n        *   Drifts/Debris: Pixels at `(11,12)` and `(12,11)` (inside the gap area, shifted diagonally) strongly suggest this gap should be filled.\n        *   Drifts below: Pixels at `(15,2)` and `(16,3)` are drifts from `(14,2)` and `(14,3)`.\n        *   Action: Create a continuous horizontal line at Row 14 from Column 0 to Column 14.\n\n    3.  **Horizontal Line (Top):** Located at **Row 3**.\n        *   Evidence: Segments `0-1` and `5-6`.\n        *   Gap: Columns `2-4`.\n        *   Drifts/Debris: Pixels at `(4,4)` (shifted from `(3,4)`?) and `(5,3)` (shifted from `(3,3)`?) suggest filling this gap.\n        *   Action: Create a horizontal line at Row 3 from Column 0 to Column 6. (Note: No evidence to extend it all the way to col 14).\n\n    4.  **Vertical Line (Left):** Located at **Column 6**.\n        *   Evidence: Continuous segment from Row 3 to Row 13. Connects the Top Horizontal line (Row 3) to the Bottom Horizontal line (Row 14).\n        *   Action: Create a vertical line at Column 6 from Row 3 to Row 14.\n\n*   **Noise Removal:** All pixels not part of these reconstructed lines (the drifts/debris at `(3,0)`, `(11,12)`, `(20,15)`, etc.) are cleared (set to background 8), unless they fall on the reconstructed lines.\n\n**Proposed Output Construction:**\n*   Start with a 29x17 grid filled with 8.\n*   Draw vertical line: `x=14` for all `y` (0-28).\n*   Draw horizontal line: `y=14` for `x` in 0-14.\n*   Draw vertical line: `x=6` for `y` in 3-14.\n*   Draw horizontal line: `y=3` for `x` in 0-6.\n\n**Output Grid generation:**\n*   `grid[0..28][14] = 9`\n*   `grid[14][0..14] = 9`\n*   `grid[3..14][6] = 9`\n*   `grid[3][0..6] = 9`\n*   All other cells are 8.\n\n```text\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- SELECT THE BEST RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1.
