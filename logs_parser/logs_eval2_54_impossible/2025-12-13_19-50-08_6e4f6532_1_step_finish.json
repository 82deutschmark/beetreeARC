My first step is to carefully analyze the solved examples, focusing on the changes between the input and output grids. I'm looking for patterns, transformations, and relationships between the elements.\n\nInitially, I identified some basic features like the grid dimensions, the background structure (mostly striped), and border colors. Then, I dug deeper, examining specific rows and columns within the examples, calculating relative indices, and trying to understand how the object shapes are formed. I created a list of all non-background pixels in order to see if a simple transformation was at play.\n\nThe \"vertical flip\" was the first pattern I explored, which seemed promising, but it got complicated when dealing with how borders and shapes interact. I began to form some hypotheses: I thought that shape transformations may occur inside a panel or that the rule for transformation might be \"Swap panels and Flip Vertically\". This seemed reasonable in example 1, but it didn't hold when I went deeper.\n\nThe core of my insight revolves around these \"panels\" and the colors within them. I realized that the transformation might be dependent on both the background and border colors in a panel and, after several adjustments, started to form the rule: 1) Vertically flip the panel content. 2) Elements with a certain color (matching border colors in other panels) move to those respective other panels after the flip.\n\nWhen I applied my algorithm, I encountered some edge cases and had to make decisions about how to resolve overlapping pixels. I hypothesized that if the algorithm produces overlapping pixels, the \"moving object\" covers the pixels of the \"staying object\".\n\nOnce I had this firm rule I could now construct and apply the transformation to the test case, producing the correct solution.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the patterns observed in the solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The grid is divided into panels separated by vertical colored bars. There is also a top/bottom border in some cases.\n    *   **Test Input:**\n        *   **Top Border:** Rows 0-1 are filled with `4` (Yellow).\n        *   **Left Border:** Cols 0-1 are `1` (Blue).\n        *   **Left Panel (P1):** Cols 2-13 (Background `7` - Orange).\n        *   **Divider:** Cols 14-15 are `2` (Red).\n        *   **Right Panel (P2):** Cols 16-25 (Background `7` - Orange).\n        *   **Right Border:** Cols 26-27 are `3` (Green).\n    *   The background within the panels is `7`. There are various objects (shapes) made of other colors inside these panels.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   **Vertical Flip:** The content of each panel is flipped vertically. If the panel has height $H$ and rows are indexed $0$ to $H-1$, the content at row $y$ moves to row $H - 1 - y$. Note that the row index is relative to the panel (or grid), effectively flipping the entire grid vertically while maintaining the panel boundaries.\n    *   **Color-Based Migration:** Objects with specific colors move between panels.\n        *   Colors that match the **outermost border** of a panel move to that panel.\n        *   In the Test Input:\n            *   **Blue (`1`)** matches the Left Border. Objects of color `1` in the Right Panel (P2) move to the Left Panel (P1). Objects of color `1` already in P1 stay there.\n            *   **Green (`3`)** matches the Right Border. Objects of color `3` in the Left Panel (P1) move to the Right Panel (P2).\n            *   **Red (`2`)** acts as the divider. In Example 1, Red objects moved. Here, the Red objects are in P2 (adjacent to the Red divider) and stay there (similar to how divider-colored objects behaved in examples).\n            *   Other colors (like `8`, `9`, `4`) stay in their respective panels.\n    *   **Collision Resolution:** When an object moves into a position occupied by another object, the moving object overlays the existing one.\n\n**Step-by-Step Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Dimensions:** 30 rows, 28 columns.\n*   **Flip Axis:** Row $y$ flips to $29 - y$.\n\n**Left Panel (P1) Processing (Cols 2-13):**\n*   **Row 3:** `8` at col 4; `8,8` at cols 6,7. -> Flip to Row 26.

Stay.\n*   **Row 6:** `3` at col 3; `3,3` at cols 6,7. -> **Move to P2** (Color 3). Flip to Row 23.\n*   **Row 9:** `9,8` at cols 10,11. -> Flip to Row 20.

Stay.\n\n**Right Panel (P2) Processing (Cols 16-25):**\n*   **Row 4:** `1` at col 20. -> **Move to P1** (Color 1). Flip to Row 25.\n    *   Target P1 Col: 20 is the 4th column in P2 (16+4). Moves to 4th column in P1 (2+4 = 6).\n    *   Wait, relative mapping: Col 20 is relative index 4 in P2. Moves to relative index 4 in P1. Col 2 + 4 = 6.\n*   **Row 5:** `8,8` at cols 20,21. -> Flip to Row 24. Stay.\n*   **Row 6:** `9,9,8,8,4` at cols 21-25. -> Flip to Row 23. Stay.\n    *   Collision with incoming `3`s from P1?\n    *   Incoming `3`s from P1 Row 6 (rel cols 1, 4, 5).\n    *   P2 Row 6 has objects at rel cols 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n    *   Collision at Rel 5 (Col 21). `3` (moving) overwrites `9` (staying).\n*   **Row 7:** `9,9,8` at cols 21-23. -> Flip to Row 22. Stay.\n*   **Row 8:** `8,8,8,8` at cols 20-23. -> Flip to Row 21. Stay.\n*   **Row 9:** `8` at 20, `8` at 23. -> Flip to Row 20. Stay.\n*   **Row 10:** `8` at 20, `8` at 23. -> Flip to Row 19.

The goal is to figure out the rule that transforms a given input grid into its corresponding output. The task involves analyzing two provided examples and a test input to identify the underlying pattern.\n\n**Initial Observations and Example Breakdown**\n\nMy initial steps involve examining the examples. I note the dimensions of the input and output grids, as these can provide vital clues about the transformation. It's crucial to identify the number of rows and columns and any structural features, such as dividers or borders. I'm looking for comma-separated value sequences to find patterns.\n\n**Example 1: Vertical Division and Horizontal Duplication**\nExample 1 presents a grid with a vertical divider. It seems the output is a vertical concatenation of the input and something related to it. The input grid seems to be the top half of a larger structure. The output shows rows 1 to 13 of the input replicated as rows 1 to 13, and rows 14 to 26 look to be related to the input grid. I see that the grid has a background color and uses distinct colors for objects, dividers, and borders. These colors will likely play a significant role in the transformation.\n\n**Example 2: Size Preservation and Object Movement**\nExample 2 presents another challenge, this time with the input and output having the same dimensions. This suggests a transformation where the size remains constant. I observe distinct objects in the grid, which seem to shift or transform, but the number of objects stays constant.\n\n**Test Input:  A Mix of Features**\n\nI then investigate the test input. It's larger than Example 1 (30 rows). It contains horizontal dividers and objects.  I am trying to see the relationship between Example 1 and Example 2. I need to understand what this test input has to show.\n\n**Hypotheses Development**\n\nBased on the examples and the test input, I generate several hypotheses:\n\n1. **Object Movement and Gravity:** Objects might \"fall\" or move under some force or rule.\n2. **Reflection and Rotation:** There might be some form of reflection (across a vertical or horizontal axis) or rotation involved in the transformation.\n3. **Panel Interactions:**  The grids can be split into panels, and the transformation involves operations between those panels.\n4. **\"Markers\" and Template Matching:** Certain locations in the grid might act as markers or target locations for objects, acting as template targets.\n\nI initially consider simple point reflection, but that's quickly dismissed. I note the colors and shapes of objects and how they change. In this particular test, the 9s seem to matter.\n\n**Focusing on Symmetry and Panel-Based Transformations**\n\nI focus on the concept of symmetry, especially concerning how borders might be acting as \"mirrors.\" The color of the borders may be indicating the transformation rules. My new hypotheses combine symmetry and panel-based transformations:\n\n*   **Mirror/Reflection Lines:** The colored borders act as mirror lines, creating transformations through reflections and shifts.\n*   **Interactions based on panel positions**: The left panel and right panel relate with each other, meaning objects in one panel might translate to an equivalent in another panel in some capacity.\n*   **Move & Reflect Objects, guided by Markers:** objects are moved or flipped, with '9' being used as an anchor point.\n\n**The Solution: Panel Swapping and Movement**\nThe key insight becomes clear.  The transformation follows this logic:\n\n1.  **Object Mapping:** Objects within the grid move to align with specific target markers ('9s') located in the grid.\n2.  **Color Defines transformation:**\n    *   Horizontal Flips.\n3.  **Cross Panel Copying:**\n    *   Top Panel -> Target (In this case, copying Right Panel to fill Left Panel Bottom).\n\n**Test Input application:**\nBased on the observations, this is the final implementation:\n\n1.  Objects in a panel are duplicated.\n2.  One objects moves to Right Bottom with an alignment using the \"9\" marker.\n3. The opposite is then applied.\n4. I need to manage overlaps (I decide to overwrite or leave be, depending on the colors).\n\nThis involves copying objects from a source region to a target region based on panel structure. It also involves adjusting the objects. This process results in a complete pattern formation.\n\n**Verification**\n\nI carefully check that the rules fit. I create a plan and test it against various grid sections.  This helps ensure that the generated output is consistent and follows the discovered logic.\n\nI have found the solution to the task!\n\n\nTo solve this task, I identified the transformation rule by analyzing the provided examples and the structure of the test input.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Structure Identification:** The grids are divided into panels by vertical border lines.\n    *   **Example 1:** Vertical dividers (1, 4, 2) separate two panels. The output is generated by copying the input to the top half and creating a \"crossed\" reflection in the bottom half: The Left Panel content moves to the Right Panel (shifted down), and the Right Panel content moves to the Left Panel (shifted down).\n    *   **Test Input:** Contains a Top Border (4), Left Border (1), Right Border (3), and a Middle Vertical Border (2). It defines a **Left Panel** (Cols 3-14) and a **Right Panel** (Cols 17-26).\n    *   The Input contains objects in the top half (Rows 3-14) and markers (`9`s) in the bottom half of the Left Panel.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule (Cross-Panel Translation):**\n    *   The task is to complete the grid by copying the objects from the top half to the bottom half, swapping panels.\n    *   **Right Panel Source (Rows 3-14)** $\\rightarrow$ **Left Panel Target (Rows 15-26)**.\n        *   Vertical Shift: +12 rows.\n        *   Horizontal Shift: -14 columns (aligns Right Panel start Col 17 to Left Panel start Col 3).\n        *   Verification: The markers `9,9` in the Left Panel Bottom (Rows 19-20) align perfectly with the `9,9` pattern in the Right Panel Source object (Rows 7-8) after this translation.\n    *   **Left Panel Source (Rows 3-14)** $\\rightarrow$ **Right Panel Target (Rows 15-26)**.\n        *   Vertical Shift: +12 rows.\n        *   Horizontal Shift: +14 columns (aligns Left Panel start Col 3 to Right Panel start Col 17).\n        *   Clipping: The Left Panel is wider (12 cols) than the Right Panel (10 cols).

this becomes a **transpose** (equivalently: rotate CW then flip left-right), then place it so its 9 lands on (21,21).\n- The right object (rows 5\u201313, cols 19\u201326) has a 2\u00d72 9-square \u2192 **rotate 90\u00b0 CCW**, then place it so that 2\u00d72 9-square lands on rows 19\u201320, cols 8\u20139.\n- The middle object (rows 8\u201311, cols 10\u201313) has a diagonal 9-pair \u2192 **flip horizontally**, then place it so the diagonal 9s land on (26,5) and (27,6).\n\nPasting these onto the base template gives the output below.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,1,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_2_step_1\">\nTransformation inferred from the examples:\n\n1. **Identify the background and the fixed frame.**  \n   The grids have a large \u201cbackground\u201d color (most frequent) plus a fixed border/divider that stays unchanged.  \n   In the test: background = **7**, top border = **4**, left border = **1**, right border = **3**, vertical divider = **2** (at columns 14\u201315).\n\n2. **Color 9 marks \u201cregistration points\u201d.**  \n   - **Targets** are the isolated 9-patterns sitting in empty background (they are not attached to other colors).  \n   - **Sources** are the blocks of non-background pixels that contain 9s *connected (through other colors)* to a larger figure.\n\n3. **Match each source to a target by the 9-pattern shape.**\n   - A **2\u00d72 block of 9s** in the source maps to the **2\u00d72 isolated 9 block** target.\n   - A **single 9** in the source maps to the **isolated single 9** target.\n   - A **diagonal pair of 9s** in the source maps to the **diagonal pair** target.\n\n4. **Orient each source block using the frame-colors embedded on its edges.**  \n   Rotate/flip so those frame-colors land on the correct side for the destination panel (top should face the top border color 4;

The task is to:\n   - **Remove all stray/isolated noise** (especially maroon dots not used as markers).\n   - For each cyan object, **rotate/flip it so that any frame-colors attached to it end up on the corresponding side**:\n     - top-frame color \u2192 top edge of the object\n     - left-frame color \u2192 left edge\n     - right-frame color \u2192 right edge\n     - (if there\u2019s a divider stripe color, it goes on the side facing the divider)\n   - Then **translate the oriented object** so that its internal maroon (9) pixels **land exactly on the free-standing maroon marker clusters** of the same shape.\n   - The original object locations are cleared back to background.\n\n### Applying to the test\n\n- Background inside the frame is **7**.\n- Fixed stripes are: **top=4**, **left=1**, **divider=2**, **right=3** (kept unchanged).\n- There are **3 cyan objects** (connected components containing 8) and **4 free maroon marker clusters**:\n  - one **2\u00d72 block** of 9s (destination for the object that contains a 2\u00d72 9 block),\n  - three **single 9 markers** (destinations for objects whose 9s are singletons; one object has two separate single 9s).\n- Required orientations:\n  - The large right object is rotated **90\u00b0 counterclockwise** so its attached frame colors align (4 on top, 1 on left, 2 on the side toward the divider), then moved onto the 2\u00d72 marker block.\n  - The mid-left object is **horizontally flipped** so its 1 moves to the left side and its two single 9s match the two single markers, then moved onto those.\n  - The small top-left object is **transposed (main-diagonal mirror)** so 4 is on top and 3 is on the right side, then moved onto the remaining single 9 marker.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,1,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_G>\n<REASONING_MODEL_H model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the two solved examples)\n\n1. **Identify the fixed frame/dividers and keep them unchanged.**  \n   In these puzzles there are thick \u201cstripes\u201d that form a frame/divider (in the examples: colored borders and/or a central divider).

Each puzzle has a **frame** (thick colored borders/stripes) and a large **background color** inside it.\n2. Inside the background there are:\n   - **Movable multicolor objects** (made mostly of one color, plus some \u201cframe-colored\u201d pixels and at least one `9`).\n   - Separate **\u201cmarker\u201d clusters of color `9`** that are *not attached* to any other color (they\u2019re isolated from the objects).\n3. In the output:\n   - The original objects are **removed** from where they started.\n   - Each object is **moved** so that its internal `9` pixels **exactly overlap** one marker-cluster of `9`s.\n   - Each object is also **rotated/flipped** so that any pixels whose colors match the frame end up on the matching **side of the object**:\n     - top-frame color \u2192 top edge of the object,\n     - left-frame color \u2192 left edge,\n     - right-frame color \u2192 right edge,\n     - (and similarly for any internal divider stripe acting as a border for a compartment).\n\n### How to solve the test\n1. **Background** is `7`. The frame is: top rows `4`, left border `1`, middle divider `2`, right border `3`.\n2. Find **marker clusters**: the `9`s that are not connected to other colors (grouped with diagonal-touching too).  \n   Here they form 3 clusters: a **2\u00d72 block**, a **diagonal pair**, and a **single**.\n3. Find the **3 objects** (connected non-background components) and match each to a marker cluster by the **shape/number of `9` pixels inside the object** (4, 2, 1 respectively).\n4. For each object, choose the **unique rotation/flip** that puts its frame-colored pixels on the correct sides (e.g. `4` on top edge, `1` on left edge, `2` on right edge, `3` on right edge where applicable).\n5. **Translate** the oriented object so its `9` pixels land exactly on the marker-cluster coordinates.\n6. Output = frame + background + the relocated objects.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n```text\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,1,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_J>\n</CANDIDATE 3>\n<CANDIDATE 4>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 45x28\n4444444444444444444444444444\n4444444444444444444444444444\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722774788777733\n1177777777777722778988777733\n1177777777777722888888777733\n1177777777777722888988777733\n1171877877777722888333777733\n1177899887777722333377777733\n1177899887777722777777777733\n1177788887777722777747779833\n1177788882777722777794779833\n1177744442777722777788888833\n1177777772777722777788888833\n1177777777777722777717777733\n4444444444444444444444444444\n4444444444444444444444444444\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722774788777733\n1177777777777722778988777733\n1177777777777722888888777733\n1177777777777722888988777733\n1171877877777722888333777733\n1177899887777722333377777733\n1177899887777722777777777733\n1177788887777722777747779833\n1177788882777722777794779833\n1177744442777722777788888833\n1177777772777722777788888833\n1177777777777722777717777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_3\">\n**Algorithm Discovery and Analysis for an ARC Task**\n\nI'm tackling an ARC problem involving grids with colored regions and patterned \"pixel\" shapes. My initial focus is on understanding the fundamental grid structure: background colors and any regular patterns, especially vertical stripes. I\u2019m starting by closely analyzing the two provided examples and a test case, working row by row and noting dimensions, colors, and repeating elements.\n\nThe examples present a two-panel structure with object-like pixels inside. I notice that input and output grids share the same overall structure, but the content in the panels changes. The goal seems to be to transform pixels from one panel into another. My first hypothesis is that the task involves assembling shapes scattered across panels. A vertical \"Flip\" transformation appears frequently.\n\nExample 1 is key. The input appears to be the \"exploded\" or scattered components. The output forms a rotated-ish, compact shape in the destination panel. The question is how to transform the \"messy\" pixels into a target image. I need to understand this transformation process \u2013 how scattered parts become a coherent whole and how the pixels move around or interact.\n\nMy analysis reveals a panel swap and a Transpose operation where pixels change position according to the relationship `(r, c) -> (c + 1, r - 1)` relative to the top of the panel and a 7 at the very top. This operation handles the movement and structure change in the example. I need to figure out exactly how pixel coordinates map and how to apply the transposition, particularly regarding the bounding box and pixel placement.\n\nThe test input confirms the hypothesis of panel swap and object transformation. It will allow me to apply the findings from the examples to a new structure and check the generalization of the transformation. The key element is to figure out the exact Transpose and placement for all pixel locations.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid based on the patterns observed in the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Task:**\n1.  **Structure:** The grids are divided into two main panels by vertical dividers.\n    *   **Example 1:** Left Panel (Cols 2-11), Right Panel (Cols 14-23). Background color 5. Dividers `1,1` and `2,2`.\n    *   **Example 2:** A single large panel bounded by `4,4` and `7,7`, but containing two implicit regions.\n    *   **Test Input:** Left Panel (Cols 2-13, Width 12), Right Panel (Cols 16-25, Width 10). Background color 7. Dividers are `1,1` (Left), `2,2` (Middle), `3,3` (Right). Rows 0-1 are headers (`4,4...`). The panels effectively start from Row 2.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   The contents of the Left Panel and Right Panel are **swapped**.\n    *   During the swap, the objects undergo a **Transpose** transformation with a specific offset.\n    *   Based on Example 1, the mapping from a source pixel at `(row, col)` to a target pixel `(row', col')` is:\n        *   Determine row relative to the panel start (`r_rel`). In the Test Input, panels start at Row 2.\n        *   Determine column relative to the panel start (`c_rel`).\n        *   Apply the transformation:\n            *   `r'_rel = c_rel + 1`\n            *   `c'_rel = r_rel - 1`\n        *   Convert back to absolute coordinates in the **target** panel.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Left Panel (Source) -> Right Panel (Target):**\n        *   Source Objects:\n            *   **Object 1 (Top Left):** 8s, 9s, 4, 3s. Located at Rows 3-6.\n                *   Example pixel: `4` at Row 5, Col 2 (relative col 0).\n                *   `r_rel = 5-2 = 3`. `c_rel = 0`.\n                *   `r'_rel = 0 + 1 = 1`. `c'_rel = 3 - 1 = 2`.\n                *   Target: Right Panel (Start Col 16). Absolute Row `2+1=3`. Absolute Col `16+2=18`.\n            *   **Object 2 (Bottom Right):** 4, 9, 8, 1. Located at Rows 7-10.\n                *   Example pixel: `1` at Row 9, Col 12 (relative col 10).\n                *   `r_rel = 7`. `c_rel = 10`.\n                *   `r'_rel = 10 + 1 = 11`. `c'_rel = 7 - 1 = 6`.\n                *   Target: Right Panel. Absolute Row `13`. Absolute Col `16+6=22`.\n    *   **Right Panel (Source) -> Left Panel (Target):**\n        *   Source Object (Messy collection of 1, 8, 9, 4, 2): Located at Rows 4-12.\n        *   Example pixel: `1` at Row 4, Col 20 (relative col 4).\n        *   `r_rel = 2`. `c_rel = 4`.\n        *   `r'_rel = 4 + 1 = 5`. `c'_rel = 2 - 1 = 1`.\n        *   Target: Left Panel (Start Col 2). Absolute Row `7`. Absolute Col `2+1=3`.\n        *   Example pixel: `2` at Row 12, Col 24 (relative col 8).\n        *   `r_rel = 10`. `c_rel = 8`.\n        *   `r'_rel = 9`. `c'_rel = 9`.\n        *   Target: Left Panel. Absolute Row `11`. Absolute Col `11`.\n\n4.  **Verification:**\n    *   The transformed width of the Left Panel content (originally width 12, height ~10) fits into the Right Panel (Width 10). specifically, the max relative row index in source is 10, so `c'_rel` max is 9. Matches width 10.\n    *   The transformed width of the Right Panel content (originally width 10, height ~10) fits into the Left Panel (Width 12). specifically, the max relative row index in source is 12 (from row 14? No max row is 12 -> rel 10), so `c'_rel` max is 9. Matches width 12 easily.\n\n**Step-by-step Construction of Output:**\n*   Initialize output grid with 7s in the panels and copy static borders/dividers.\n*   **Process Left Panel Source:**\n    *   Pixels at (3,4) [8] -> T(1,2) -> R3, C18 (Right Panel C2).\n    *   Pixels at (5,2) [4] -> T(3,0) -> R5, C16? Wait.\n        *   (5,2): `r_rel=3`, `c_rel=0`. `r'=1`, `c'=2`. Target (3, 18).\n    *   Let's execute the logic systematically for the final grid.\n\nOutput Grid Generation:\n4,4,4...

The inputs and outputs are grids where each number represents a color. The task seems to be about figuring out the pattern of change from the input to the output.\n\nFirst, I looked at the grid structure. The examples show that the grids are fairly large and seem to have a recurring pattern. I broke down the grid into segments to pinpoint the important segments. There are clear borders and vertical dividers. The main action happens inside these vertical dividers.\n\nThe initial hunch was that the transformation might be a simple swap or some sort of rotation. But that's where things got tricky. I tested a bunch of theories. I looked at horizontal flips, vertical flips, and even 180-degree rotations. None of those worked directly. I started looking at the shapes within the panels and found patterns. The key was to look for the bounding box of non-background elements.\n\nEventually, it looked like a combination of transformations that was happening. It's like the shapes are being flipped AND moved. The movement seemed to relate to a vertical flipping of the elements. I kept trying to fit those observations into patterns. It's like \"reflection and position\" but there was a pattern on HOW the positions changed.\n\nAfter a bunch of back and forth, I saw the pattern. The panel content seems to be rotated 180 degrees. This rotation occurs relative to the panels, and the rotation is happening independently on each panel. I found a way to map the input position to output position using the equation: `Output = (H-1- row, W-1- col)`.\n\nThe final plan is:\n1.  Identify vertical dividers and grid borders.\n2.  The content is divided into panels defined by the dividers and borders.\n3.  Each panel gets its content flipped 180 degrees using a position translation defined by height and width as defined above.\n4.  Background pixels (like 7) are empty.\n5.  Border pixels are preserved.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we identify the transformation rule by observing the changes from the input grids to the output grids in the provided examples.\n\n**Analysis of Example 1:**\nThe grid is divided into two main panels by a vertical divider (columns 12-13, color 4).\n- **Left Panel:** Columns 2-11 (Width 10).\n- **Right Panel:** Columns 14-23 (Width 10).\n- The borders (columns 0-1 and 24-25) and the background (color 5) define the frame.\nComparing the Input to the Output:\n- The content of the Left Panel in the Output corresponds to the content of the Left Panel of the Input, but **rotated 180 degrees** (flipped vertically and horizontally).\n- Similarly, the content of the Right Panel in the Output corresponds to the content of the Right Panel of the Input, rotated 180 degrees.\n- Note: In Example 1, there was a potential swap of panels, but closer inspection of Example 2 suggests a simpler per-panel rotation.\n\n**Analysis of Example 2:**\nThe grid has a frame (rows 0-1, 24-25 and columns 0-1, 24-25).\n- The inner content (rows 2-23, columns 2-23) contains shapes on a background of color 1.\n- Top Object (rows 3-6) moves to the bottom (rows 11-14) and is flipped vertically and horizontally relative to the center of the available space.\n- Bottom Object (rows 10-15) moves to the top/bottom (rows 17-22) and is similarly inverted.\n- The transformation is consistent with rotating the active area of each panel 180 degrees.\n\n**Rule for Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Structure:**\n    -   **Global Frame:** Rows 0-1 are color 4.\n    -   **Left Border:** Columns 0-1 (color 1).\n    -   **Right Border:** Columns 26-27 (color 3).\n    -   **Vertical Divider:** Columns 14-15 (color 2).\n    -   This creates two panels within Rows 2-29:\n        -   **Left Panel:** Columns 2-13 (Width 12).\n        -   **Right Panel:** Columns 16-25 (Width 10).\n    -   **Background Color:** 7.\n\n2.  **Transformation:**\n    -   Preserve the global frame (Rows 0-1) and the vertical columns (Borders and Divider).\n    -   For each panel (Left and Right) within the vertical range [Row 2, Row 29]:\n        -   **Rotate the content 180 degrees.**\n        -   This is equivalent to mapping a pixel from Input `(r, c)` to Output `(r', c')` where:\n            -   `r' = 29 - (r - 2) + 2 = 31 - r`.\n            -   `c' = (Width - 1) - c` (relative to the panel start).\n\n3.  **Applying the Transformation:**\n    -   **Left Panel (Cols 2-13):**\n        -   Input Bottom shapes (`9`s at R18-R26) rotate to become Output Top shapes (R5-R13).\n        -   Input Top shapes (`8,9,3,4` etc. at R3-R10) rotate to become Output Bottom shapes (R21-R28).\n    -   **Right Panel (Cols 16-25):**\n        -   Input Top shapes (`9,8,4,2` etc. at R6-R12) rotate to become Output Bottom shapes (R19-R25).\n        -   Input Bottom is empty, so Output Top will be empty.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n-   **Rows 0-1:** `4`s.\n-   **Columns 0-1:** `1`s.\n-   **Columns 14-15:** `2`s.\n-   **Columns 26-27:** `3`s.\n-   **Panels:** Fill with background `7`, then place rotated objects.\n\n**Rotated Objects Coordinates:**\n-   **Left Panel Top (from Input R26 `9`):** Output R5, Col 2+(11-2)=11 (Rel 9).\n-   **Left Panel Bottom (from Input R3 `8`):** Output R28, Col 2+(11-4)=9 (Rel 7).\n-   **Right Panel Bottom (from Input R6 `9988`):** Output R25, Col 16+(9-1)=24 (Rel 8) -> `4` (Input x=1 -> Out x=8). `8899` (Input 5..8 -> Out 1..4).\n\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,2,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,8,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,2,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,2,7,7,8,7,7,7,8,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,2,7,7,8,7,7,7,8,3,3\n1,1,7,2,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,2,7,7,8,7,7,7,8,3,3\n1,1,7,2,3,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,9,9,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,7,7,3,7,2,2,7,8,8,9,9,7,7,7,4,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,4,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,8,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 5>\n<CANDIDATE 6>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x28\n4444444444444444444444444444\n4444444444444444444444444444\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177774444777722777777777733\n1177788888777722777777777733\n1117888888827722777747777733\n1117889988827722777888777733\n1117889988827722772888377733\n1117888888827722772898377733\n1177788888777722772888377733\n1177777777777722777888777733\n1177447777777722777777777733\n1118882777777722777777777733\n1118982777777722777777777733\n1118898277777722777777777733\n1117888277777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_3\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Grid Structure**: The grid has colored borders and a divider.

Find **movable objects**: connected non\u2011background components that include **9** plus other colors.\n5. **Match** each object to the marker with the same 9\u2011shape:\n   - single 9 \u2194 single\u20119 marker\n   - 2\u00d72 block of 9s \u2194 2\u00d72 marker\n   - diagonal pair of 9s \u2194 diagonal\u2011pair marker\n6. **Orient** (rotate/flip) each object so that any frame-colors it contains end up on the corresponding side in its destination region (this disambiguates symmetric 9\u2011patterns), then **translate** it so its 9s land exactly on the marker 9s.\n7. **Erase** the object from its original location (restore to background), leaving only the moved copies.\n\n**Applied to the test input:**\n- Object with **2\u00d72 block of 9s** (originally in the right area) is rotated **90\u00b0 CCW** so its internal **4** is on top, **1** on the left, **2** on the right, then moved so its 2\u00d72 9-block lands on the marker at rows 19\u201320, cols 8\u20139.\n- Object with a **single 9** (top-left cluster with 3s and a 4) is **transposed** (swap rows/cols) so **4** is on top and **3** on the right, then moved so its 9 lands on the marker at (21,21).\n- Object with a **diagonal pair of 9s** is **horizontally flipped** to match the marker\u2019s diagonal direction and put the internal **1** on the left, then moved onto the diagonal marker at (25,5) and (26,6).\n\nCompleted output grid:\n```text\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,1,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 7>\n<CANDIDATE 8>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x28\n4444444444444444444444444444\n4444444444444444444444444444\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777477777722777777777733\n117777787777722777777777733\n117777787777722777777747733\n117777799777722777777783733\n117777799777722777889887733\n117777788777722777887787733\n117777788777722777787783733\n117777788777722777777737733\n117777788777722777777777733\n117777788777722777777777733\n117798888777722777777777733\n111889888777722777777777733\n117788777777722777777777733\n117788777777722777777777733\n117777777777722777777777733\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_11_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n**ARC Task Summary - Expert Level**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. My job is to figure out the rules from two solved examples and apply it to a test input. Let\u2019s break down my thought process:\n\n**Initial Analysis and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nI need to understand what constitutes a \u201cmovable object,\u201d how they\u2019re identified, and how they\u2019re transformed and moved based on the given examples. I recognize the key concepts:\n\n1.  **Framework:** The grid boundaries and colored \"walls\" define the spatial context.\n2.  **Movable Objects:** The fundamental unit is not simply an \"8\" pixel, but rather a *composite*. This includes a cluster of \"8\"s (core) that are connected (using the basic 4-connectivity rule) plus any \"9\" pixels it's connected to, and any additional adjacent pixels of other colors (attachments).\n3.  **Anchors:** These are single \"9\" pixels or clusters of isolated \"9\" pixels *not* touching any \"8\" pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** Objects need to be rotated and/or flipped so that the attached pixels face the appropriate \u201cframework-color side\u201d in the target location, which is defined by the walls in the room the target \"9\" is in.\n5.  **Mapping:** Objects will be moved to the location of the anchor they match.\n\n**Example 1 Deep Dive:**\n\n*   In Example 1, there are two distinct rooms. The object in the left room had a core cluster of \"8\"s, a \"9\", and some additional \"2\" (bottom) and \"4\" (top) pixels. The right room's object has another set of \"8\"s and \"9\"s with an additional pixel attachment on top.\n*   The \"9\" that is attached to the 8s in the right room becomes important, as there is another, solitary \"9\" in the opposite room.\n*   The key is: Identify the movable object and the anchor points.\n*   Here, one object has a single 9; the other has a horizontal pair of 9s, and they swap places!\n*   The horizontal pixel becomes vertical: It's all about attaching pixels to the correct \"walls.\"\n*   Since the goal is matching the framework walls, I'm thinking 90-degree rotations.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   This time, there\u2019s a big room with different colored walls on each side, with a central divider.\n*   I look for the framework colors and the objects. There's a single 9 at one end and an object with two.\n*   The horizontal \"9\" is attached to the object on one side.\n*   I can see the framework is all about the wall attachments again.\n*   There's also some diagonal connectivity in Object 2. This suggests I need to be *very* careful with the pixel layout.\n*   So, a lot of connectivity questions come up. Are parts of one object?\n*   There's an isolated 9 (Anchor). There's also the 9s *within* the objects (which *cannot* be anchors since they are attached to \"8\"s).\n*   Since two clusters have the horizontal, 9 at the bottom and the other, single 9 (Anchor).  I'm thinking those should swap.\n*   I check connectivity: Is the cluster connected or not?\n*   In the second example, object 1 is moved to object 2 and gets vertically flipped to face north\n\n**General Rules and Pattern Recognition:**\n\n*   Based on my analysis, the transformation rules involve either rotations or flips to make the object's attached pixels match the destination wall colors and \"9\" positions.\n*   I recognize the critical element is the *pattern* of 9s. Single 9s are matched to single 9s, pairs to pairs, and so on.\n*   The attached colors act like a key to decide the exact transform.\n\n**Test Input Approach:**\n\n*   I start by finding the \"8\" clusters and the \"9\" clusters.\n*   I identify what pixels are attached and how these can be translated to match the framework, specifically the \u201cwalls\u201d.\n*   I see three objects (A, B, and C) which each have an isolated or 2x2 cluster of 9s attached to them.\n*   Object A is facing left and has a \"9\" attached.\n*   Object B has an object cluster with the \"9\" attached.\n*   Object C has a 2x2.\n*   Three separate rooms! Each contains a 9 and object. The goal is to move the objects to their destination.\n*   Object A\n\nThe transformation involves identifying composite \"movable objects\" (color 8 shapes with color 9 cores and various attachments) and \"destination anchors\" (isolated clusters of color 9).\n\n**Logic:**\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   **Object A:** Located in the left region (cols 2-13, rows 3-6). Core is a single 9 at (4,5). Attachments are color 4 (facing West) and color 3 (facing South).\n    *   **Object B:** Located in the left region (cols 2-13, rows 8-11). Core is a diagonal pair of 9s at (8,10) and (9,9). Attachment is color 1 (facing East).\n    *   **Object C:** Located in the right region (cols 16-25, rows 6-13). Core is a 2x2 square of 9s at (6,21) to (7,22). Attachments are color 4 (facing East) and color 2 (facing South).\n\n2.  **Identify Anchors:**\n    *   **Anchor 1 (Left Room):** 2x2 square of 9s at (18,7)-(19,8). Matches Object C's core.\n    *   **Anchor 2 (Left Room):** Diagonal pair of 9s at (25,4) and (26,5). Matches Object B's core.\n    *   **Anchor 3 (Right Room):** Single 9 at (20,20). Matches Object A's core.\n\n3.  **Determine Transformations:**\n    *   **Object A -> Anchor 3:** Destination room (Right) has walls 4 (North), 3 (East), 2 (West). Object A has attachments 4 and 3. We need 4 to face North and 3 to face East. Original 4 faced West, 3 faced South. The transformation `Transpose` (swap row/col) achieves this (West->North, South->East).\n    *   **Object B -> Anchor 2:** Destination room (Left) has walls 1 (West), 2 (East). Object B has attachment 1. We need 1 to face West. Original 1 faced East. The transformation `Horizontal Flip` achieves this and also matches the diagonal 9-pattern (\"/\" becomes \"\\\").\n    *   **Object C -> Anchor 1:** Destination room (Left) has walls 4 (North), 2 (East), 1 (West). Object C has attachments 4 and 2. We need 4 to face North and 2 to face East. Original 4 faced East, 2 faced South. The transformation `90\u00b0 Counter-Clockwise Rotation` achieves this (East->North, South->East).\n\n4.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   Erase original objects.\n    *   Draw transformed objects at anchor locations.\n\n**Output Grid Calculation:**\n*   **Object A (Transposed):** Center 9 at (20,20). 4 at (17,21). 3s at (18,22), (21,22), (22,22). 8s surrounding accordingly.\n*   **Object B (H-Flipped):** 9s at (25,4), (26,5). 1 at (26,2). 8s surrounding.\n*   **Object C (90\u00b0 CCW):** 9s at (18,7)-(19,8). 4 at (15,7). 2s at (16,13), (17,13), (20,13). 8s surrounding.\n\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,9,8,8,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,8,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,8,3,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,9,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,9,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 8>\n<CANDIDATE 9>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x28\n4444444444444444444444444444\n4444444444444444444444444444\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177747777777722777777777733\n1177788477778222777777777733\n1177788888778222777777777733\n1177488998778722777774777733\n1177789998877722777778377733\n1177718888888222777788877733\n1177777777777722777888877733\n1177777778887722777888377733\n1177777777777722777733377733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177477777777722777777777733\n1178977777777722777777977733\n1171889777777722777777797733\n1177887777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n**Detailed Process for Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this ARC problem: The goal is to move shapes within a grid based on some rules.

The description focuses on \"framework\" lines (which are 2-pixels wide), \"backgrounds\" of solid colors (separated by framework), and \"composite shapes\" which consist of a primary color 8 (teal-light blue), \"core\" color 9 (maroon/dark red) inclusions, plus optional \"attachments\" in other colors.\n\nThe heart of the transformation is to preserve the framework and background, treat connected composite shapes as movable objects, and find \"destination anchors.\" These anchors are clusters of 9s that *aren't* connected to any 8s. The composite shapes will then be moved to the anchor locations, but there's a catch: the color and orientation of the \"attachments\" must match the color of the adjacent framework. Basically, the colors of things have to line up.\n\nI'm starting my analysis with Example 1. I'm carefully reading the input grid and identifying the framework (the colored lines, in this case, blue, yellow, and red columns). I'm also looking at the color 5 background, and I notice that the compartments are separated by these colored grid lines. I'm focusing on \"source shapes\" and trying to find the 8 and 9 patterns, and looking for which shapes are moving, and which are stationary.\n\nI see shapes with the 8s and 9s. I see that the \"9s\" can be a key or \"anchor\" for translating objects. Looking at input and output, I'm trying to figure out which shape is moved to where. It's becoming clear that there are source shapes (composites with 8s and 9s) and destination spots (isolated 9s). I'm looking for these independent 9s.\n\nI'm carefully re-reading the transformations described in the description and realizing that I have to link the source \"9s\" to destination isolated \"9s\". And for each composite, I have to ensure the 9 pixels in the shape coincide with the anchor. I have to look for isolated \"9\" clusters.\n\nI'm noticing something crucial: the orientation of the shape matters. The description says that the attachments have to face the \"corresponding framework color.\" That implies rotations and/or reflections will be necessary. For Example 1, I see that the framework colors are Blue, Yellow, Red, from Left to Right.\n\nI'm analyzing the example grid, I'm noticing an interesting pattern of 9s in the source shapes: I'm seeing that the 9 in the input's Right compartment moves to the left side and in the output, it ends up rotated, with attachments facing the correct colored walls (the attachment's color has to match the boundary color it's next to). In this case, I deduce the source 9 is moved to be an anchor, or destination point.\n\nI'm working out the transformations. For example, the yellow attachment has to face the yellow framework. This tells me I might need to apply a 90-degree rotation.\nThe left shape must be rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise (CCW). This rotates the shape. I'm working through it to make the math correct.\n\nI'm developing a step-by-step logic:\n1.  **Identify Components:** I'm recognizing the framework walls (columns of solid color), shapes (connected regions of 8s, 9s, and attachments), and anchors (isolated clusters of 9s).\n2.  **Matching:** I'm finding and matching shapes to anchors based on the pattern of their 9-cores (single vs. double, etc.)\n3.  **Transformation:** I'm determining rotations or flips needed to align the attachments (colors) of the shape with the color of the \"framework\" they end up against.\n4.  **Execution:** Clear original shapes, and then draw the transformed shapes at their new location.\n\nFor the example:\n*   I'm looking for a way to use rotation to ensure the corresponding wall and attachment colors align.\n\nNow, I'm taking the \"test input\" the user has provided. I'm carefully going through the input grid, step by step. I'm identifying the framework (cols 0-1, 14-15, 26-27), the background (\n\nThe problem asks us to perform a grid transformation based on identified objects and rules.\n\n**1. Analysis of Objects and Framework**\n*   **Framework/Compartments:** The grid is divided into two main compartments by 2-pixel wide vertical lines.\n    *   **Left Compartment (Cols 2-13):** Bounded by Blue (1) on the left, Red (2) on the right, and Yellow (4) on top (Rows 0-1).\n    *   **Right Compartment (Cols 16-25):** Bounded by Red (2) on the left, Green (3) on the right, and Yellow (4) on top.\n    *   **Background:** Color 7 (Orange).\n*   **Shapes (Source):** Composite objects made of color 8 (teal) with \"cores\" of color 9 (maroon) and attachments of colors 1, 2, 3, 4.\n    1.  **L-Top Shape (Left Comp, Rows 3-6):**\n        *   Core: Single 9 at (4,5).\n        *   Attachments: `4` (Left side, at 5,2), `3` (Bottom side, at 6,3/6/7).\n    2.  **L-Mid Shape (Left Comp, Rows 8-11):**\n        *   Core: Diagonal 9s at (9,10) and (10,9) (Note: Input text analysis corrects coordinates to Row 9,10).\n        *   Attachments: `4` (Top side, at 8,10), `1` (Right side, at 10,12).\n    3.  **R-Shape (Right Comp, Rows 5-13):**\n        *   Core: 2x2 block of 9s at (7,21), (7,22), (8,21), (8,22).\n        *   Attachments: `1` (Top side, at 5,20), `4` (Right side, at 7,25), `2` (Bottom side, at 13,20/23/24).\n*   **Anchors (Destination):** Clusters of 9s in the background, not connected to 8s.\n    1.  **L-2x2 Anchor (Left Comp):** 2x2 block at (18,7)-(19,8).\n    2.  **L-Diag Anchor (Left Comp):** Diagonal pair at (26,4) and (27,5).\n    3.  **R-Single Anchor (Right Comp):** Single 9 at (20,20).\n    4.  **R-Diag Anchor (Right Comp):** Diagonal pair at (26,18) and (27,19).\n\n**2. Transformation Logic**\nWe match source shapes to destination anchors based on the 9-pattern (Core) and orient the shape so its attachments face the compartment walls of the corresponding color.\n\n*   **Move 1: L-Top Shape -> R-Single Anchor**\n    *   **Match:** Single 9 Core matches Single 9 Anchor.\n    *   **Orientation:** Source has `4` (Left), `3` (Bottom). Destination (Right Comp) has Walls: Top (4), Right (3).\n    *   **Transform:** We need `4` to face Top and `3` to face Right.\n    *   **Operation:** Flip Horizontal (Left->Right) then Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW (Right->Top). Or simply **Transpose** (swap row/col offsets).\n        *   `4` (Left) -> Top.\n        *   `3` (Bottom) -> Right.\n    *   **Execution:** Move shape centered at (4,5) to (20,20) with Transpose.\n\n*   **Move 2: L-Mid Shape -> L-Diag Anchor**\n    *   **Match:** Diagonal 9s match L-Diag Anchor.\n    *   **Orientation:** Source has `4` (Top), `1` (Right). Destination (Left Comp) has Walls: Top (4), Left (1).\n    *   **Transform:** We need `4` to stay Top and `1` to face Left.\n    *   **Operation:** **Flip Horizontal**.\n        *   `4` (Top) -> Top.\n        *   `1` (Right) -> Left.\n    *   **Execution:** Move shape centered at (9,10) to (26,4) with Horizontal Flip.\n\n*   **Move 3: R-Shape -> L-2x2 Anchor**\n    *   **Match:** 2x2 9s match L-2x2 Anchor.\n    *   **Orientation:** Source has `1` (Top), `4` (Right), `2` (Bottom). Destination (Left Comp) has Walls: Left (1), Top (4), Right (2).\n    *   **Transform:** We need `1` -> Left, `4` -> Top, `2` -> Right.\n    *   **Operation:** **Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW**.\n        *   `1` (Top) -> Left.\n        *   `4` (Right) -> Top.\n        *   `2` (Bottom) -> Right.\n    *   **Execution:** Move shape from (7,21) to (18,7) with 90\u00b0 CCW Rotation.\n\n*   **Erase:** All original shape pixels are replaced with background (7).\n\n**3. Output Generation**\nThe final grid is constructed by clearing the source shapes and drawing the transformed shapes at the destination coordinates. The R-Diag anchor remains empty as there is no corresponding source shape.\n\noutput:\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,8,8,4,7,7,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,8,8,9,9,8,7,7,8,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,8,9,9,9,8,8,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 9>\n<CANDIDATE 10>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x28\n4444444444444444444444444444\n4444444444444444444444444444\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777477777722777777777733\n1177777877778222777777777733\n1177777888888222777774777733\n1177777998777722777778377733\n1177778998777722777888377733\n1177718778888222777797777733\n1177777777887722777888377733\n1177777777887722777888377733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177477777777722777777777733\n1178977777777722777777777733\n1118897777777722777777777733\n1177887777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_6_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n\n1. **Identify framework elements**: Top border (rows 0-1, color 4), left border (cols 0-1, color 1), right border (cols 26-27, color 3), vertical divider (cols 14-15, color 2), background color 7.\n\n2. **Identify composite shapes** (8s connected to 9s with attached color pixels):\n   -

Let's break it down:\n\nI'm seeing a pattern where the grid is divided into regions by vertical \"dividers,\" and the content within these regions gets transformed. Ex 1 gave me a clue with a 90-degree clockwise rotation, which made sense given the specific divider color. But the test input has a \"Red\" divider.\n\nLooking closely at Ex 1 and Ex 2, and the structure of Test Input, I've noticed:\n\n1. **Divider Color Matters**: The divider color seems to dictate the transformation. In Ex 1 (yellow divider, color 4), the rule turned out to be a 90-degree Clockwise rotation (verified by mapping pixel coordinates between input and output). Ex 2, having no divider, saw a vertical flip, likely because of the single region structure, so no swapping.\n\n2. **Test Input's Red Divider**:  With the test input sporting a \"Red\" divider (color 2), I started with a vertical flip, given that Ex 2 was a single region and saw a vertical flip. Yet, the sizes of the region did not match with a straight flip. After some consideration, my intuition is telling me that the rule might be a **180-degree rotation** or point reflection, considering that it is 2 and 2 is half of 4.\n\n3. **Size Considerations**: To determine a transformation, I must account for the region sizes. The Test Input has two regions, but they aren't the same size as those in Ex 1. By a few attempts, it has been decided that the interior L region is in indices 3..12, and the R region is indices 16..25, both making a width of 10. Given the 10-wide regions, a rotation of 180 degrees can be handled properly.\n\nThe plan: First extract and isolate the meaningful region, defined by the \"7\" background. The content area, is made of pixels other than 7. Second, for each content pixel (r, c) within the effective L or R region, the rule `(r, c) -> (31 - r, 28 - c)` is applied to map pixels to the resulting output. The dividers, borders, and frame elements are preserved as is.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on patterns inferred from examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Structure:** The grids are divided into vertical panels (regions) separated by vertical bars (dividers) of specific colors.\n    *   **Example 1:** Two regions (Left, Right) separated by a yellow (color 4) divider. The transformation involves rotating the content of the Left region 90 degrees clockwise and moving it to the Right region, and vice versa.\n    *   **Example 2:** A single region (bounded by yellow and orange bars). The transformation is a Vertical Flip of the objects within the region.\n    *   **Test Input:** Two regions separated by a red (color 2) divider.\n        *   Left Region (L): Columns 2-13 (12 columns wide, but effectively 10 columns of content with padding).\n        *   Right Region (R): Columns 16-25 (10 columns wide).\n        *   Divider: Columns 14-15 (Color 2).\n\n2.  **Inferred Rule:** The transformation depends on the color of the vertical divider between regions.\n    *   **Yellow Divider (4) -> Rotate 90\u00b0 Clockwise + Swap Regions.** (From Example 1).\n    *   **No Central Divider (or Frame only) -> Vertical Flip.** (From Example 2).\n    *   **Red Divider (2) -> Rotate 180\u00b0 + Swap Regions.** (Hypothesis for Test Input).\n        *   Color 2 is half of 4, and 180\u00b0 is related to 90\u00b0. 180\u00b0 rotation is equivalent to a point reflection.\n        *   Checking geometry: Rotating the Left region content (10x28) by 180\u00b0 fits perfectly into the Right region (10x28), and vice versa. A 90\u00b0 rotation would not fit (width 25 vs 10).\n\n3.  **Applying the Rule (Point Reflection/180\u00b0 Rotation):**\n    *   We define the \"effective\" content areas for the Left and Right regions.\n        *   Left Content: Rows 2-29, Columns 3-12 (Col 2 and 13 are padding 7s).\n        *   Right Content: Rows 2-29, Columns 16-25.\n    *   The transformation maps every pixel `(r, c)` in the content areas to `(r', c')` such that:\n        *   `r' = 31 - r`\n        *   `c' = 28 - c`\n    *   This formula effectively rotates the combined content area 180 degrees around the center point of the grid (Row 15.5, Col 14).\n    *   Pixels from the Left region map to the Right region, and pixels from the Right region map to the Left region. Background pixels (7) map to background pixels.\n\n**Step-by-Step Construction of Output:**\n1.  Start with a copy of the Test Input to preserve the frame (Rows 0-1 are 4s) and dividers (Cols 0-1 are 1s, Cols 14-15 are 2s, Cols 26-27 are 3s).\n2.  Clear the interior regions (Cols 2-13 and 16-25, Rows 2-29) to the background color 7.\n3.  Iterate through the Test Input's interior regions. For every non-background pixel at `(r, c)`:\n    *   Calculate target position: `target_row = 31 - r`, `target_col = 28 - c`.\n    *   Place the pixel's color at `output[target_row][target_col]`.\n\n**Examples of Point Mapping:**\n*   Input `(4, 4)` is 8. Maps to `(31-4, 28-4) = (27, 24)` -> 8.\n*   Input `(3, 21)` is 9. Maps to `(31-3, 28-21) = (28, 7)` -> 9.\n\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,5,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,2,2,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,8,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,8,7,7,8,8,7,7,8,8,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,1,8,8,9,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,7,7,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,9,9,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,9,9,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,4,8,8,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,7,7,3,3,4,8,8,9,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,3,7,3,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,8,8,5,8,3,8,4,4,1,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,8,8,1,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,8,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,5,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,1,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 11>\n<CANDIDATE 12>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x28\n4444444444444444444444444444\n4444444444444444444444444444\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777717733\n1177777777777722777778877733\n1177777777777722777498877733\n1177288889977722777777987733\n1177777789977722777777777733\n1177777788877722788837777733\n1177288887877722788837777733\n1177287777477722779777777733\n1177777777777722788877777733\n1177777777777722777737777733\n1177777777777722774777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777997777722777777777733\n1177777997777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777797777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177977777777722777777777733\n1177797777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n**The Strategy**\n\nAlright, here's the plan I've cooked up after staring at these ARC grids for a while. It's all about how these rectangular playgrounds are divided and how the colorful shapes inside move around.\n\nFirst, I noticed the grids are big, with these distinct vertical strips separated by specific colors. The important stuff seems to happen in these \"fields\" within the strips. These fields have things in them (objects) that do all the action.\n\nThe key is figuring out the transformations. So, from looking at a few examples, here's what seems to happen:\n\n-   **Swapping and Rotating:** It looks like, in some cases, the content from one field (like a column) is swapped with another, but there's a rotation involved, like a 90-degree twist (either clockwise or counter-clockwise). This rotation direction could depend on the color of the border around the whole thing, or maybe the type of object. Also, in a few cases, it looked like a 180 flip was happening.\n\n-   **Objects and Color:** There seem to be special objects, defined by their shape and color. So, the output might be these objects moved, rotated, and changed a bit based on the color. Some colors might be the background, and some might act like a \"glue\" for these objects.\n\nWith the analysis, it seems that there are two main types of objects:\nThe ones with odd \"wings\" might lead to a counter-clockwise rotation when swapping fields.\nThe ones with even \"wings\" (or no wings) might lead to a clockwise rotation.\nIt seems that the border color affects the rotation direction.\n\nMy core hypothesis is: it's a combination of swapping field contents, or parts of it, plus rotating them (or other transformations like flipping). The border colors and internal colors might be hints for the precise rules (like the rotation direction).\n\n**To summarize, this is how I would approach the test input:**\n\n*   Identify the Left and Right fields\n*   Examine the objects in both fields\n*   Determine the transformation associated with the border colors (rotate CCW, CW, or flip).\n*   Perform the transformation. Place it in the correct target field.\n*   Draw the output!\n\nThe problem requires transforming the grid based on the properties of the vertical fields and their borders. We identified two main fields in the test input: a Left Field (Color 7, surrounded by Blue border 1) and a Right Field (Color 7, surrounded by Green border 3, with a Red separator 2).\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation rules are inferred as follows:\n1.  **Border Color Codes:**\n    *   **1 (Blue) & 2 (Red):** Rotate content 90\u00b0 Counter-Clockwise (CCW).\n    *   **4 (Yellow):** Rotate content 90\u00b0 Clockwise (CW).\n    *   **7 (Orange):** Vertical Flip.\n    *   **3 (Green):** Inferred to behave symmetrically to 4 (CW) or simply following the pattern that 1,2 are CCW and 3,4 are CW. Given the geometric relationships and the need for the wide Left object to fit into the narrower Right field (and vice versa), the rotations are necessary. We treat **Border 3 as CW**.\n\n2.  **Field Swap:**\n    *   The presence of a separator (Color 2 in Test, Color 4 in Example 1) implies that the contents of the Left and Right fields **swap**.\n    *   Left Content (Border 1 -> CCW) moves to the Right Field.\n    *   Right Content (Border 3 -> CW) moves to the Left Field.\n\n**Transformation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Extract Left Object:**\n    *   Source: Left Field (Cols 3-14), Rows 4-11 (ignoring outliers).\n    *   Operation: **Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW**.\n    *   Target: Right Field (Cols 17-26).\n    *   Position: Maintain vertical start (Row 4), center horizontally in the new field.\n\n2.  **Extract Right Object:**\n    *   Source: Right Field (Cols 17-26), Rows 7-13.\n    *   Operation: **Rotate 90\u00b0 CW**.\n    *   Target: Left Field (Cols 3-14).\n    *   Position: Maintain vertical start (Row 7), center horizontally in the new field.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Copy the input background and borders.\n    *   Clear the inner regions of the Left and Right fields (Color 7).\n    *   Render the transformed objects at their target locations.\n\n**Output Grid Details:**\n*   **Left Field (Cols 3-14):** Contains the Right Object rotated CW.\n    *   Top-Left at (Row 7, Col 5).\n    *   Rows:\n        *   Row 7: `2,8,8,8,8,9,9`\n        *   Row 8: `7,7,7,7,8,9,9` (Background 7 represented as spaces for clarity)\n        *   Row 9: `7,7,7,7,8,8,8`\n        *   Row 10: `2,8,8,8,8,7,8`\n        *   Row 11: `2,8,7,7,7,7,4`\n*   **Right Field (Cols 17-26):** Contains the Left Object rotated CCW.\n    *   Top-Left at (Row 4, Col 18).\n    *   Rows:\n        *   Row 4: `7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7`\n        *   Row 5: `7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7`\n        *   Row 6: `7,7,7,4,9,8,8,7`\n        *   Row 7: `7,7,7,7,7,7,9,8`\n        *   Row 8: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7` (Empty row in object)\n        *   Row 9: `8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7`\n        *   Row 10: `8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7`\n        *   Row 11: `7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n        *   Row 12: `8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7`\n        *   Row 13: `7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7`\n        *   Row 14: `7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7`\n\noutput:\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,4,9,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,2,8,8,8,8,9,9,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,8,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,2,2,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,2,8,8,8,8,7,8,7,7,7,2,2,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,2,8,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 12>\n<CANDIDATE 13>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x28\n4444444444444444444444444444\n4444444444444444444444444444\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177778788777722777777777733\n1177778998777722777777777733\n1177488998777722777887777733\n1177737733777722777798884733\n1177777777777722777788877733\n1177777777777722777888877733\n1177777777777722788877877733\n1177477777777722788877877733\n1178977777777722777877887733\n1118897777777722777277227733\n1177887777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. The grids have colored borders (edges and dividers) that define regions\n2. Within each region, there are patterns made of 8s with 9s at the center, plus colored \"markers\" (matching border colors) indicating directional extensions\n3. There are also \"isolated\" 9s (not connected to the 8-patterns)\n4. The transformation moves each 8-pattern to center on the isolated 9 locations in its region\n5. The pattern may be reflected/rotated as needed to align with the isolated 9 positions\n6. The markers update based on which borders are now closest in each direction\n\nFor the test input:\n- **Left region patterns:** One pattern (rows 3-6) moves to isolated 9s at rows 18-19, cols 7-8. Another pattern (rows 7-10) moves to isolated 9s at rows 25-26.\n- **Right region pattern:** The pattern (rows 5-12) moves to the isolated 9 at row 20, col 20.\n\nThe original pattern locations are cleared (replaced with background color 7), and the patterns are reconstructed at the new positions with appropriate marker colors.\n\n```\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,8,8,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,3,7,7,3,3,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,9,8,8,8,4,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,8,8,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,8,8,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,7,7,8,8,7,7,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n**Comprehensive Task Analysis and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The user wants me to solve an ARC problem. I'm seeing two example grids and a test grid. My approach will be to analyze the examples to understand the transformation rules, then apply them to the test input.\n\n**Example Dissection:**\n\nI'll start by looking at Example 1. The input appears to be vertically segmented into regions with specific colors. It seems a central shape is formed in a specific area.\n\nIn Example 1, the key is the Grey region, divided into vertical regions. The input data's structure seems straightforward: there is noise inside the vertical regions. My initial hypothesis is removing noise from the given data.\n\nThen, I'll move on to Example 2. It's a complete grid with frame colors defining each side, and a blue background inside. I am beginning to recognize objects with vertical symmetry. I will identify the patterns.\n\nThen, there's another clue. I am looking into \"hints\".\n\nHint 1 \"Remove isolated single pixels (noise)\", hint 2 is \"Keep main objects and their maroon parts\" , the last is \"colors from the border appears inside objects\".\n\nAfter going through those hints, I have a clear idea. First identify objects and transform them:\n-   remove single-pixel noise.\n-   use vertical symmetry for objects\n\n**Formulating the Solution:**\n\nThe problem is the edge and the positions of the objects. The examples suggest:\n\n1.  **Denoising:** I'll focus on removing pixels that aren't the primary shapes (teal or maroon). Anything that appears isolated and doesn't belong to a larger connected component of these colors is probably noise.\n2.  **Vertical Flip and Position:** The transformation appears to involve a vertical reflection of the main object components. The objects seem to be reflected, then potentially shifted down.\n3.  **Border Decoration:** Once an object is in its new location, the edge pixels get \"decorated\" with the border colors from its corresponding region. The Top border seems to take priority.\n\n**Test Input application:**\n\nThe test input grid is also divided into regions with color stripes.\nMy process will be:\n\n1.  Initialize output grid with frame colors.\n2.  Identify object locations by identifying connected groups of 8 and 9.\n3.  For each object:\n    *   Flip it vertically to the other side.\n    *   Decorate its edges with border colors from its new region.\n\nLet's do this!\n\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying the \"objects\" (connected components of teal `8`s and maroon `9`s), vertically reflecting their positions across the center of the grid (Row $r \\rightarrow H-1-r$), and then \"decorating\" their edges based on the colors of the surrounding region borders.\n\n**Logic:**\n1.  **Identify Regions:** The grid is divided by vertical stripes.\n    *   **Region 1 (Left):** Columns 2-13. Borders: Top=Yellow(4), Left=Blue(1), Right=Red(2).\n    *   **Region 2 (Right):** Columns 16-25. Borders: Top=Yellow(4), Left=Red(2), Right=Green(3).\n2.  **Filter & Reflect:** Extract the objects (ignoring noise like isolated pixels not belonging to the main shapes). Reflect the entire object configuration vertically (e.g., an object at the top moves to the bottom).\n3.  **Decorate:** Apply border colors to the pixels at the extremities of the reflected objects:\n    *   **Top Edge:** Becomes the Top Border color (Yellow `4`). This takes priority.\n    *   **Left Edge:** Becomes the Left Border color (Blue `1` for Region 1, Red `2` for Region 2).\n    *   **Right Edge:** Becomes the Right Border color (Red `2` for Region 1, Green `3` for Region 2).\n    *   **Internal Pixels:** Remain their original color (`8` or `9`), unless they are on an edge.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Region 1 Object 1 (Small, Top):** Originally at Rows 25-26. Reflects to Rows 3-4.\n    *   Row 3 (Top): Becomes `4`.\n    *   Row 4 (Bottom): Becomes `1` (Left border).\n*   **Region 1 Object 2 (Middle):** Originally at Rows 8-10. Reflects to Rows 19-21.\n    *   Row 19 (Top): `8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `4,4`.\n    *   Row 20: `9,8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `1,8,2` (Left=1, Right=2).\n    *   Row 21: `9,8` $\\rightarrow$ `1,2`.\n*   **Region 1 Object 3 (Bottom):** Originally at Rows 3-5. Reflects to Rows 24-26.\n    *   Row 24 (Top): `8,8,.,8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `4,4,7,4,4`.\n    *   Row 25: `8,9,8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `1,9,8,2`.\n    *   Row 26: `8,.,8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `1,7,8,2`.\n*   **Region 2 Object 1 (Small, Top):** Originally at Rows 18-19. Reflects to Rows 10-11.\n    *   Row 10 (Top): `9,9` $\\rightarrow$ `4,4`.\n    *   Row 11: `9,9` $\\rightarrow$ `2,3` (Left=2, Right=3).\n*   **Region 2 Object 2 (Large, Bottom):** Originally at Rows 6-12. Reflects to Rows 17-23.\n    *   Row 17 (Top): `2,7,7,2,2` $\\rightarrow$ `4,7,7,4,4`.\n    *   Row 18: `8,7,7,8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `2,7,7,8,3`.\n    *   Row 19: `8,8,8,7,7,8` $\\rightarrow$ `2,8,8,7,7,3`.\n    *   Row 20: Same as 19.\n    *   Row 21: `8,8,8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `2,8,8,3`.\n    *   Row 22: `9,9,8` $\\rightarrow$ `2,9,3`.\n    *   Row 23: `9,9,8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `2,9,8,3`.\n\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,4,4,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,4,4,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,8,3,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,8,8,7,7,3,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,2,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,8,8,7,7,3,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,8,8,3,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,9,3,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,9,8,3,7,3,3\n1,1,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,1,9,8,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,1,7,8,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 15>\n<CANDIDATE 16>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x28\n4444444444444444444444444444\n4444444444444444444444444444\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777779947733\n1177774744777722777779377733\n1177498277777722777748377733\n1177448712777722777723777733\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n**Algorithm Formulation and Optimization for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's my understanding of this ARC task.

The size of the grid is huge.\n\n**Analysis of the input:** I'm seeing rectangular grids with color-coded \"containers\" or panels. These are separated by vertical dividers. Within these, there are shapes made of different colors. I've noted that certain color values represent borders, background, objects, and internal details within objects.\n\n**My Hypotheses:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification and Movement:** I'll begin by detecting objects (clusters of pixels, especially light cyan teal-8 and maroon-9) by filtering the noise. There is a lot of noise. The objects seem to be moving to specific locations. It's likely a form of gravity, but I need to understand what defines the \"floor\" or destination. My working hypothesis is, that the objects fall to the bottom of the section.\n\n2.  **Border-Driven Decoration:** Once objects reach their destination, I'll need to apply transformations to their edges. The hint about \"border-driven edge-decoration\" is vital. Based on the border colors (left, right, top, bottom), specific pixels in the object will be replaced by the border colors. I will need to determine whether the horizontal borders, vertical borders or both, affect the objects.\n\n**Refinement of Hypotheses:**\n\n1.  **Defining the Gravity Destination**: It's not standard gravity. The position of an object might be shifted due to the starting positions and the divider. I'm discarding the possibility that noise pixels act as anchors, which were a hypothesis for a while, because that doesn't hold up consistently. I assume the objects need to fall to the \"bottom of their column\" or some fixed offset.\n\n2.  **Color Transformation and Pixel Coloring Priority**: The colors on the border are the most important. I've observed that specific pixels in the object (usually on the edges) are re-colored to match their surrounding borders. Pixels on horizontal sides are subject to the horizontal border and are colored appropriately. Pixels on the vertical sides are subject to vertical borders. So the top will be colored with the top border, the left will be colored with the left border, etc. There is an interaction between the borders and the pixels that determines the pixel's new value. If a pixel is exposed on more than one side, I need to understand priority. I'm assuming that **Top** overrides the other borders. If that doesn't work, I'll change it to the other order: the Left overrides the Top.\n\n**Test Input application:**\n\nGiven a new test input, I'll follow this plan:\n\n1.  **Reconstruct Background:** Reproduce the original grid background, including border and divider colors.\n\n2.  **Extract Objects:** Filter for the main object pixels. Ignore noise. Reset all colored pixels within the main objects to the base color (8) if they are not maroon (9).\n\n3.  **Placement of Objects:** Place the extracted objects at the bottom of their column.\n\n4.  **Border-Driven decoration:** Apply color changes based on border rules. Assign colors (1, 2, 3, or 4) to exposed edges. Top will be 4 in all the cases.\n\n5.  **Output Generation**: Compose the final output grid and write it as text in the specified format. The output has to be the full grid.\n\n6.  **Edge Priority**. Top is always the dominant color.\n\n7.  **Preservation of Inner Colors**: Do not touch the value of pixels 9.\n\nTo solve this task, we first analyze the transformation logic based on the provided examples.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Grid Structure:**\n- The grids consist of vertical \"panels\" defined by colored borders and dividers.\n- **Test Input Borders:**\n  - **Top:** Rows 0-1 are filled with Yellow (4).\n  - **Left:** Columns 0-1 are Blue (1).\n  - **Divider:** Columns 14-15 are Red (2), separating the grid into a Left Panel and a Right Panel.\n  - **Right:** Columns 26-27 are Green (3).\n  - **Background:** The empty space inside the panels is Orange (7).\n\n**2. Transformation Rules:**\n- **Object Identification:** We identify \"objects\" inside the panels. These are clusters of Teal (8) and Maroon (9) pixels. We ignore isolated \"noise\" pixels (like the scattered maroon dots at the bottom or isolated border-colored pixels) and focus on the main connected shapes.\n  - *Left Panel Object:* Located at rows 4-6.\n  - *Right Panel Object:* Located at rows 7-10.\n- **Gravity:** The objects fall to the bottom of the grid (or the bottom of their respective panels).\n  - In the test input, the grid has 30 rows. The objects will be moved so that their lowest pixels rest on Row 29.\n- **Decoration (Coloring):** Once the objects settle, their boundary pixels change color based on the panel borders they are \"exposed\" to.\n  - **Priority:** Top/Bottom borders seem to take precedence over Left/Right borders based on Example 2. Maroon (9) internal details are preserved and not overwritten.\n  - **Left Panel Logic:**\n    - Left Border: Blue (1).\n    - Right Border: Red (2).\n    - Top Border: Yellow (4).\n    - *Rule:* Exposed Top pixels -> 4. Exposed Left pixels -> 1. Exposed Right pixels -> 2.\n  - **Right Panel Logic:**\n    - Left Border: Red (2).\n    - Right Border: Green (3).\n    - Top Border: Yellow (4).\n    - *Rule:* Exposed Top pixels -> 4. Exposed Left pixels -> 2. Exposed Right pixels -> 3.\n\n**3. Applying the Transformation:**\n\n**Left Object:**\n- Original Shape (from rows 4-6, columns 2-13):\n  - Row 0 (top): Pixels at relative offsets corresponding to `..8.88`\n  - Row 1: `8988..`\n  - Row 2 (bottom): `888.88` (treating the yellow `4` noise as part of the teal `8` shape).\n- Destination: Rows 27-29.\n- **Decoration:**\n  - **Row 27 (Top of object):** All top-facing `8`s become Top Border Color (4).\n  - **Row 28:**\n    - Leftmost `8` is Top-exposed (due to shape gap) -> 4.\n    - `9` is preserved.\n    - Rightmost `8` is Right-exposed -> 2.\n  - **Row 29 (Bottom of object):**\n    - Leftmost `8` is Top-exposed -> 4.\n    - Next `8` is Top-exposed -> 4.\n    - `8` with gap on right -> 2.\n    - `8` with gap on left -> 1.\n    - Rightmost `8` is Right-exposed -> 2.\n\n**Right Object:**\n- Original Shape (from rows 7-10, columns 16-25):\n  - Row 0 (top): `.....998..`\n  - Row 1: `.....98...`\n  - Row 2: `....888...` (treating `1` noise as `8`).\n  - Row 3 (bottom): `....88....`\n- Destination: Rows 26-29.\n- **Decoration:**\n  - **Row 26:** Top `8`s -> 4. `9`s preserved. Right `8` -> 3 (Right Border).\n  - **Row 27:** Right `8` -> 3.\n  - **Row 28:** Left `8` is Top-exposed -> 4. Right `8` -> 3.\n  - **Row 29:** Left `8` -> 2 (Left Border). Right `8` -> 3.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\nThe background (7s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s) is reconstructed. The noise is removed. The processed objects are placed at the bottom.\n\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,4,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,4,7,4,4,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,9,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,9,8,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,4,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,4,8,7,1,2,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 16>\n<CANDIDATE 17>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x28\n4444444444444444444444444444\n4444444444444444444444444444\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177718877777722777777777733\n1177777998877722777777777733\n1177777998777722777777777733\n1177718888777722772878877733\n1171888778777722772898877733\n1171888778777722778878837733\n1177778778877722777777777733\n1118888877777722777777777733\n1118988877777722777777777733\n1118898877777722777777777733\n1118888877777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_5_step_5_generate_hint\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Border structure**: The grid has colored borders/dividers (left: 1, right: 3, divider: 2, top: 4) with a background of 7.\n\n2. **Main shapes**: There are cyan (8) objects with internal maroon (9) features.\n\n3. **Isolated 9s**: These act as markers indicating where shapes should be placed/moved to.\n\n4. **Transformation rule**: \n   -

The user wants me to crack an ARC puzzle. Two examples are provided, and then a test input. The task seems to involve reshaping objects within a grid.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe main focus is on how shapes move between two regions separated by wall-like dividers. The output grids demonstrate a change in object arrangement or position.\n\nLet's break down Example 1. There are rooms with scattered object parts that are re-assembled in the other room. Initially, I thought it was a 90 CCW rotation and room swap. However, after careful tracing and the \"image\" output provided, it is clearer that it's a 180-degree rotation. The rotation is what makes the components seem to be swapped/assembled.\nI confirmed it again on example two, and realized it's a 180 rotation combined with room swap and point reflection.\n\nExample 2 showed a full grid with objects across it. There is a top object, and a bottom object. The output shows a reflected-swap of those objects across a midpoint in the grid.\n\nThese examples make me think there's a principle, especially with walls and borders being intact. I think there is a 180 rotation and object-focused reflection at the grid-center.\n\nThis becomes my main strategy: Extract the core objects in each region. Filter out the single-pixel \"noise\" objects. Reflect and assemble the objects. Rebuild the walls and background.\n\n**Test Input application**\n\nThe Test Input is next. I am now applying the algorithm on it.\n\nI'm thinking that it may involve a 90 rotation because the object's width is wider than the region's width. But maybe 180 still?\n\nI believe the most reliable approach is to exclude the wall colors from the \"object\" and exclude single-pixel clusters.\n\nI'm betting I need a 90 rotation. Because a 180 might cause clipping. But I'll need the right rotation direction. Test input has object widths/lengths that won't fit into the space with 180.\nSo it's either 90 degrees or it has to fit exactly, by excluding some.\n\nI am re-analyzing the rotation. The user's input of an ARC task is important.\n\n**Final Plan**\n\nHere's the detailed plan I'm implementing:\n\n1.  Analyze the input grid. Determine backgrounds, walls, borders, and regions.\n2.  Identify core objects and remove noise objects with a count less than two pixels.\n3.  Perform a 90 CCW rotation.\n4.  Reflect the object positions across the center of each room to move between regions.\n5.  Position objects.\n6.  Draw the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid based on the pattern observed in the examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The grids are divided into two main \"rooms\" by vertical walls.\n    *   Example 1: Left Room (cols 2-11), Right Room (cols 14-23).\n    *   Example 2: A single large room, but the transformation swaps objects between top-left and bottom-right, behaving like two zones.\n    *   Test Input: Left Room (cols 2-13), Right Room (cols 16-25).\n2.  **Object Identification**: Inside these rooms, there are shapes made of non-background colors. We observe \"main\" multi-colored objects and some smaller single-pixel \"noise\" or disconnected fragments.\n    *   In the examples, the single-pixel disconnected fragments (noise) are removed in the output.\n    *   The main connected components are preserved and transformed.\n3.  **Transformation Logic**:\n    *   **Swap Rooms**: The object from the Left Room moves to the Right Room, and the object from the Right Room moves to the Left Room.\n    *   **Rotation**: The objects are rotated **180 degrees** (Point Reflection).\n        *   Example 1: The \"C\" shape opens Right $\\rightarrow$ Output opens Left. Yellow Top $\\rightarrow$ Yellow Bottom. (180 deg).\n        *   Example 2: The \"L\" shape has Yellow Left $\\rightarrow$ Output Red Left (Yellow Right). Wait, 180 deg means Yellow Left $\\rightarrow$ Yellow Right. Top $\\rightarrow$ Bottom.\n    *   **Vertical Positioning**:\n        *   In Example 2, an object at the Top moves to the Bottom. An object in the Middle/Bottom moves to the Top. This indicates a **Vertical Reflection** of the position relative to the room's height.\n        *   $Row_{new} = Height_{room} - Row_{old} + Offset$.\n        *   In Example 1, the vertical movement is less drastic but consistent with centering or reflecting within the active zone.\n        *   For the Test Input, which shares the \"Top Wall\" feature with Example 2, we will apply **Vertical Reflection** (Top $\\rightarrow$ Bottom).\n    *   **Horizontal Positioning**: The objects are **centered horizontally** within their new rooms.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Parse Input**:\n    *   **Background**: 7 (Orange).\n    *   **Left Room**: Cols 2-13 (Width 12). Contains a multicolored \"Lamp/Tree\" shape at the top (Rows 3-10).\n    *   **Right Room**: Cols 16-25 (Width 10). Contains a multicolored shape at the top (Rows 4-13).\n    *   **Walls**: Yellow (4) at top, Blue (1) left, Red (2) middle, Green (3) right.\n\n2.  **Process Left Object**:\n    *   **Source**: Rows 3-10, Cols 2-12. (Center roughly Row 6.5).\n    *   **Action**: Rotate 180 degrees.\n    *   **Target**: Right Room (Cols 16-25).\n    *   **Vertical Position**: Reflect across the room height (Rows 2-29).\n        *   Input is at Top. Output goes to **Bottom**.\n        *   New rows approx 21-28.\n    *   **Horizontal Position**: Center in Right Room.\n\n3.  **Process Right Object**:\n    *   **Source**: Rows 4-13. (Center roughly Row 8.5).\n    *   **Action**: Rotate 180 degrees.\n    *   **Target**: Left Room (Cols 2-13).\n    *   **Vertical Position**: Reflect to **Bottom**.\n        *   New rows approx 18-27.\n    *   **Horizontal Position**: Center in Left Room.\n\n4.  **Noise Removal**: Small isolated pixels (like the `9`s at row 19, 26) are treated as noise and removed.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   Start with the base grid (Walls and Background).\n*   Place the transformed Left Object into the Right Room (bottom).\n*   Place the transformed Right Object into the Left Room (bottom).\n\n**Output Grid**:\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,8,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,8,8,1,8,8,9,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,4,8,8,9,9,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,3,3,7,7,3,7,7,3,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,8,8,7,8,8,4,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,8,8,9,8,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 18>\n<CANDIDATE 19>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x28\n4444444444444444444444444444\n4444444444444444444444444444\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777727722722777377337733\n1177777787788722774887777733\n1177778887787722777789877733\n1177778887787722777787877733\n1177777788887722777777777733\n1177777779988422777777777733\n1177777777777722777788777733\n1177777777777722777988177733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n1177777777777722777777777733\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_8_step_5_image\">\n**The Task: A Deep Dive into ARC's Compartmental Swaps and Vertical Flips**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given a couple of examples and a test input, and my job is to solve it. I'm seeing patterns here. I think this involves colored grids that have regions, or \u201ccompartments.\u201d The transformation appears to be about reshuffling the contents.  I'm trying to figure out the underlying logic.\n\nMy mind immediately begins to break down the first example.  I spot a gray background and then vertical colored stripes.  Each compartment seems to contain objects, and, lo and behold, in the output, these objects have moved around!  I'm focusing in on the objects themselves\u2014are they swapped, copied, or reflected?  I need to determine what is the \"object\" and what is noise. I start meticulously tracing colors, reading grid data, and then re-reading the image.  I need to make sure I get this right.  One of the isolated pixels is gone!\n\nI form my first hypothesis: it's a swap! The object on the left, moves to the right and vice versa. However, I notice a lot of noise. This will complicate things. I trace the objects to see if my hypothesis is true.\n\nI meticulously trace pixel by pixel. Oh no, it\u2019s not just a simple swap. I start to analyze the data. Now, a key observation appears. Example 2 has no walls in the middle but the object is clearly \"left\" and \"right\". The pattern is clearly. I've realized noise pixels are irrelevant in these transformations.\n\nAfter analyzing example 2, I form a revised, and more comprehensive plan. I must think of these compartments or zones, then find the objects, then swap their positions. Simple enough, but what about the noise? I start to think.\n\nI discover that the objects are not merely swapping positions; there is a vertical flip involved too! It seems to be a combination of swapping and reflecting. I need to be careful with positioning, because I don\u2019t think objects swap around perfectly. There is a method to the madness!\n\nMy analysis is complete and I've created two rules. The final transformation: swap the objects between the compartments. Remove any noise, and vertically flip the final configuration.\n\nI need to confirm by applying my rules to Test Input. I see an arrangement similar to Example 1: two compartments separated by a vertical wall.  I trace the columns and rows, painstakingly documenting each color and its position. In the test input, I discover two objects on the left and one on the right.  Do I apply the vertical flip to individual components? I must think this through.\n\nI try to visualize the outcome, based on my analysis of the first two examples. My plan begins to take shape.  I need to transform the test input.\n\nI create the output, by creating a new grid with compartments, then populate the flipped and moved objects in the new locations. I realize that I have to apply several transformations: extracting the objects from their original compartments, removing the noise pixels (because those are usually just artifacts), swap the two compartments, and vertically flip. I am ready to implement the final output. The key is in accurately tracking all the transformations, so that the object colors end up in the right place.\n\n\nThe transformation involves identifying the two main compartments separated by vertical walls, identifying the objects within them, and then swapping the contents of the compartments while applying a vertical flip to the objects. \"Noise\" (small isolated clusters or single pixels not part of the main structures) is removed.\n\n**Step-by-Step Logic:**\n\n1.  **Identify Compartments:**\n    *   **Left Compartment:** Columns 2-13 (Width 12).\n    *   **Right Compartment:** Columns 16-25 (Width 10).\n    *   Walls are at Columns 0-1 (Blue), 14-15 (Red), 26-27 (Green), and Rows 0-1 (Yellow).\n\n2.  **Identify Objects (and filter noise):**\n    *   **Left Compartment:**\n        *   **Object A:** Located at Rows 3-6. Spans Columns 2-7. Colors involved: 8 (Teal), 9 (Maroon), 4 (Yellow), 3 (Green).\n        *   **Object B:** Located at Rows 9-10. Spans Columns 9-12. Colors: 9, 8, 1 (Blue).\n        *   Other pixels (e.g., `9`s at Row 19, 26, 27) are treated as noise and removed.\n    *   **Right Compartment:**\n        *   **Object C:** Located at Rows 6-11. Spans Columns 18-25 (roughly). Colors: 9, 8, 4, 2 (Red).\n        *   Other pixels (e.g., `9`s at Row 20, 26) are treated as noise.\n\n3.  **Transformation (Swap & Flip):**\n    *   **Move Right Content to Left:** Object C moves to the Left Compartment.\n    *   **Move Left Content to Right:** Objects A and B move to the Right Compartment.\n    *   **Vertical Flip:** All objects are vertically flipped (top row becomes bottom row, etc.).\n    *   **Vertical Alignment:** Objects are placed starting from the top of the available space (Row 3).\n        *   Object C (flipped) is placed at Row 3 in the Left Compartment.\n        *   Object A (flipped) is placed at Row 3 in the Right Compartment.\n        *   Object B (flipped) is placed below Object A, maintaining the original gap of 2 rows. Since A ends at Row 6 (height 4), B starts at Row 9.\n    *   **Horizontal Alignment:** Objects are horizontally centered within their new compartments.\n        *   **Object C:** Width 8 (Cols 18-25).

There are also isolated 9 pixels scattered in the grid that don't belong to any shape.\n\n3. **Transformation Rule**: \n   - Identify shapes (clusters of 8s with embedded 9s and color markers)\n   - Identify isolated 9 pixels (not connected to 8-shapes)\n   - Move each shape so its internal 9s align with the isolated 9 positions\n   - The isolated 9s serve as \"target locations\" for the shapes\n   - Shapes may need to be mirrored to match the 9 pattern orientation\n\n**Applying to test input:**\n\n- **Shape 1** (upper-left, single 9 at row 4, col 5) \u2192 moves to isolated 9 at (20, 20)\n- **Shape 2** (middle-left, diagonal 9s) \u2192 moves to isolated diagonal 9s at (25,4) and (26,5), mirrored horizontally\n- **Shape 3** (right side, 2\u00d72 block of 9s) \u2192 moves to isolated 2\u00d72 block at rows 18-19, cols 7-8\n\nThe original shapes and isolated 9s are removed, and shapes are placed at their new target positions with their markers preserved.\n\n```\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,8,4,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,7,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,9,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,4,8,8,7,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,3,7,3,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 20>\n</INPUT_DATA>\n\n<AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\nExecute this pipeline sequentially for every Candidate. You must output your thinking process inside <AUDIT_LOG> tags.\n\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\n- **Selection:** If a Candidate contains multiple <REASONING> blocks, read them all and select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation to audit.\n- **Crystallization:** Convert that text into a strict \"IF-THEN\" algorithm.\n  - *Bad:* \"The pattern involves moving blue pixels.\" (Too vague to audit)\n  - *Good:* \"IF a pixel is Blue, THEN move it 1 step Right. Else, preserve color.\"\n- *Constraint:* If the reasoning is incoherent or vague, mark the Candidate as \"INVALID - VAGUE\".\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT (CRITICAL)\n- You must \"Back-Test\" the Crystallized Rule against the {{SOLVED_EXAMPLES}}.\n- For **EACH** Solved Example pair (Input -> Output), you must strictly perform this 3-step check:\n  1. **Hypothesis:** \"If I apply the Candidate's Rule to this Input, exactly what *should* happen?\"\n  2. **Observation:** \"Look at the actual Official Output. What *actually* happened?\"\n  3. **Verdict:** \"Do they match?\"\n- **Fatal Contradictions to Watch For:**\n  * **Scope Error:** Rule applies to specific colors (e.g., \"Blue\"), but the example changes \"Red\" pixels.\n  * **Geometry Error:** Rule says \"rotate 90,\" but example shows a flip.\n  * **Object Error:** Rule treats pixels individually, but example shows objects moving as blocks.\n- *Constraint:* Record exactly how many Solved Examples the candidate PASSED vs FAILED. **Do not stop at the first failure**; check all examples to determine the severity of the failure (e.g., \"Passed 2/3 Examples\").\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n- For Candidates that survived Phase 2 (or passed at least one example):\n- Look at the {{TEST_INPUT}} and the Candidate's <PROPOSED_SOLUTION> grid.\n- Does the proposed output actually follow the Crystallized Rule?\n- *Common Hallucination:* The text says \"Move Blue,\" but the grid shows Blue staying still. Mark this as **INTERNAL_CONTRADICTION**.\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING & TIE-BREAKING\n- Rank ALL candidates from Best to Worst based on this hierarchy:\n  1. **GOLD (Tier 1):** Passed ALL Solved Examples + Consistent Execution on Test Input.\n  2. **SILVER (Tier 2):** Passed ALL Solved Examples + Minor Execution Error on Test Input.\n  3. **BRONZE (Tier 3):** Passed MOST Solved Examples (Partial Logic).\n  4. **INVALID (Tier 4):** Failed ALL/MOST Solved Examples, Vague Reasoning, or Severe Internal Contradictions.\n\n- **Tie-Breaking:** If two candidates are in the same Tier, rank the one with the **Simplest Rule** (Occam's Razor) higher.\n</AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\n\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfit\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",

ARC task:**\n\nI'm presented with two solved examples and a test input, and I need to figure out the rule. My first step is to carefully analyze the solved examples, focusing on the changes between the input and output grids. I'm looking for patterns, transformations, and relationships between the elements.\n\nInitially, I identified some basic features like the grid dimensions, the background structure (mostly striped), and border colors. Then, I dug deeper, examining specific rows and columns within the examples, calculating relative indices, and trying to understand how the object shapes are formed. I created a list of all non-background pixels in order to see if a simple transformation was at play.\n\nThe \"vertical flip\" was the first pattern I explored, which seemed promising, but it got complicated when dealing with how borders and shapes interact. I began to form some hypotheses: I thought that shape transformations may occur inside a panel or that the rule for transformation might be \"Swap panels and Flip Vertically\". This seemed reasonable in example 1, but it didn't hold when I went deeper.\n\nThe core of my insight revolves around these \"panels\" and the colors within them. I realized that the transformation might be dependent on both the background and border colors in a panel and, after several adjustments, started to form the rule: 1) Vertically flip the panel content. 2) Elements with a certain color (matching border colors in other panels) move to those respective other panels after the flip.\n\nWhen I applied my algorithm, I encountered some edge cases and had to make decisions about how to resolve overlapping pixels. I hypothesized that if the algorithm produces overlapping pixels, the \"moving object\" covers the pixels of the \"staying object\".\n\nOnce I had this firm rule I could now construct and apply the transformation to the test case, producing the correct solution.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the patterns observed in the solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The grid is divided into panels separated by vertical colored bars. There is also a top/bottom border in some cases.\n    *   **Test Input:**\n        *   **Top Border:** Rows 0-1 are filled with `4` (Yellow).\n        *   **Left Border:** Cols 0-1 are `1` (Blue).\n        *   **Left Panel (P1):** Cols 2-13 (Background `7` - Orange).\n        *   **Divider:** Cols 14-15 are `2` (Red).\n        *   **Right Panel (P2):** Cols 16-25 (Background `7` - Orange).\n        *   **Right Border:** Cols 26-27 are `3` (Green).\n    *   The background within the panels is `7`. There are various objects (shapes) made of other colors inside these panels.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   **Vertical Flip:** The content of each panel is flipped vertically. If the panel has height $H$ and rows are indexed $0$ to $H-1$, the content at row $y$ moves to row $H - 1 - y$. Note that the row index is relative to the panel (or grid), effectively flipping the entire grid vertically while maintaining the panel boundaries.\n    *   **Color-Based Migration:** Objects with specific colors move between panels.\n        *   Colors that match the **outermost border** of a panel move to that panel.\n        *   In the Test Input:\n            *   **Blue (`1`)** matches the Left Border. Objects of color `1` in the Right Panel (P2) move to the Left Panel (P1). Objects of color `1` already in P1 stay there.\n            *   **Green (`3`)** matches the Right Border. Objects of color `3` in the Left Panel (P1) move to the Right Panel (P2).\n            *   **Red (`2`)** acts as the divider. In Example 1, Red objects moved. Here, the Red objects are in P2 (adjacent to the Red divider) and stay there (similar to how divider-colored objects behaved in examples).\n            *   Other colors (like `8`, `9`, `4`) stay in their respective panels.\n    *   **Collision Resolution:** When an object moves into a position occupied by another object, the moving object overlays the existing one.\n\n**Step-by-Step Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Dimensions:** 30 rows, 28 columns.\n*   **Flip Axis:** Row $y$ flips to $29 - y$.\n\n**Left Panel (P1) Processing (Cols 2-13):**\n*   **Row 3:** `8` at col 4; `8,8` at cols 6,7. -> Flip to Row 26.

Stay.\n*   **Row 10:** `9,8,8,1` at cols 9-12. -> Flip to Row 19. Stay.\n*   **Row 11:** `8,8` at cols 9,10. -> Flip to Row 18.

Moves to 4th column in P1 (2+4 = 6).\n    *   Wait, relative mapping: Col 20 is relative index 4 in P2. Moves to relative index 4 in P1. Col 2 + 4 = 6.\n*   **Row 5:** `8,8` at cols 20,21. -> Flip to Row 24. Stay.\n*   **Row 6:** `9,9,8,8,4` at cols 21-25. -> Flip to Row 23.

The goal is to figure out the rule that transforms a given input grid into its corresponding output. The task involves analyzing two provided examples and a test input to identify the underlying pattern.\n\n**Initial Observations and Example Breakdown**\n\nMy initial steps involve examining the examples. I note the dimensions of the input and output grids, as these can provide vital clues about the transformation. It's crucial to identify the number of rows and columns and any structural features, such as dividers or borders. I'm looking for comma-separated value sequences to find patterns.\n\n**Example 1: Vertical Division and Horizontal Duplication**\nExample 1 presents a grid with a vertical divider. It seems the output is a vertical concatenation of the input and something related to it. The input grid seems to be the top half of a larger structure. The output shows rows 1 to 13 of the input replicated as rows 1 to 13, and rows 14 to 26 look to be related to the input grid. I see that the grid has a background color and uses distinct colors for objects, dividers, and borders. These colors will likely play a significant role in the transformation.\n\n**Example 2: Size Preservation and Object Movement**\nExample 2 presents another challenge, this time with the input and output having the same dimensions. This suggests a transformation where the size remains constant. I observe distinct objects in the grid, which seem to shift or transform, but the number of objects stays constant.\n\n**Test Input:  A Mix of Features**\n\nI then investigate the test input. It's larger than Example 1 (30 rows). It contains horizontal dividers and objects.  I am trying to see the relationship between Example 1 and Example 2. I need to understand what this test input has to show.\n\n**Hypotheses Development**\n\nBased on the examples and the test input, I generate several hypotheses:\n\n1. **Object Movement and Gravity:** Objects might \"fall\" or move under some force or rule.\n2. **Reflection and Rotation:** There might be some form of reflection (across a vertical or horizontal axis) or rotation involved in the transformation.\n3. **Panel Interactions:**  The grids can be split into panels, and the transformation involves operations between those panels.\n4. **\"Markers\" and Template Matching:** Certain locations in the grid might act as markers or target locations for objects, acting as template targets.\n\nI initially consider simple point reflection, but that's quickly dismissed. I note the colors and shapes of objects and how they change. In this particular test, the 9s seem to matter.\n\n**Focusing on Symmetry and Panel-Based Transformations**\n\nI focus on the concept of symmetry, especially concerning how borders might be acting as \"mirrors.\" The color of the borders may be indicating the transformation rules. My new hypotheses combine symmetry and panel-based transformations:\n\n*   **Mirror/Reflection Lines:** The colored borders act as mirror lines, creating transformations through reflections and shifts.\n*   **Interactions based on panel positions**: The left panel and right panel relate with each other, meaning objects in one panel might translate to an equivalent in another panel in some capacity.\n*   **Move & Reflect Objects, guided by Markers:** objects are moved or flipped, with '9' being used as an anchor point.\n\n**The Solution: Panel Swapping and Movement**\nThe key insight becomes clear.  The transformation follows this logic:\n\n1.  **Object Mapping:** Objects within the grid move to align with specific target markers ('9s') located in the grid.\n2.  **Color Defines transformation:**\n    *   Horizontal Flips.\n3.  **Cross Panel Copying:**\n    *   Top Panel -> Target (In this case, copying Right Panel to fill Left Panel Bottom).\n\n**Test Input application:**\nBased on the observations, this is the final implementation:\n\n1.  Objects in a panel are duplicated.\n2.  One objects moves to Right Bottom with an alignment using the \"9\" marker.\n3. The opposite is then applied.\n4. I need to manage overlaps (I decide to overwrite or leave be, depending on the colors).\n\nThis involves copying objects from a source region to a target region based on panel structure. It also involves adjusting the objects. This process results in a complete pattern formation.\n\n**Verification**\n\nI carefully check that the rules fit. I create a plan and test it against various grid sections.  This helps ensure that the generated output is consistent and follows the discovered logic.\n\nI have found the solution to the task!\n\n\nTo solve this task, I identified the transformation rule by analyzing the provided examples and the structure of the test input.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Structure Identification:** The grids are divided into panels by vertical border lines.\n    *   **Example 1:** Vertical dividers (1, 4, 2) separate two panels. The output is generated by copying the input to the top half and creating a \"crossed\" reflection in the bottom half: The Left Panel content moves to the Right Panel (shifted down), and the Right Panel content moves to the Left Panel (shifted down).\n    *   **Test Input:** Contains a Top Border (4), Left Border (1), Right Border (3), and a Middle Vertical Border (2). It defines a **Left Panel** (Cols 3-14) and a **Right Panel** (Cols 17-26).\n    *   The Input contains objects in the top half (Rows 3-14) and markers (`9`s) in the bottom half of the Left Panel.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule (Cross-Panel Translation):**\n    *   The task is to complete the grid by copying the objects from the top half to the bottom half, swapping panels.\n    *   **Right Panel Source (Rows 3-14)** $\\rightarrow$ **Left Panel Target (Rows 15-26)**.\n        *   Vertical Shift: +12 rows.\n        *   Horizontal Shift: -14 columns (aligns Right Panel start Col 17 to Left Panel start Col 3).\n        *   Verification: The markers `9,9` in the Left Panel Bottom (Rows 19-20) align perfectly with the `9,9` pattern in the Right Panel Source object (Rows 7-8) after this translation.\n    *   **Left Panel Source (Rows 3-14)** $\\rightarrow$ **Right Panel Target (Rows 15-26)**.\n        *   Vertical Shift: +12 rows.\n        *   Horizontal Shift: +14 columns (aligns Left Panel start Col 3 to Right Panel start Col 17).\n        *   Clipping: The Left Panel is wider (12 cols) than the Right Panel (10 cols).

pictures**: larger multi\u2011color connected components that also contain some **9** cells.\n\n3. **Each movable picture is cut out as its full bounding rectangle** (including any background cells inside that rectangle), then:\n   - **rotated/flipped** so that any colors matching the frame\u2019s special colors end up on the corresponding side (top-frame color on the top edge, left-frame color on the left edge, right-frame color on the right edge, etc.),\n   - then **translated so that its 9-pattern lands exactly on the marker 9-pattern**.\n   - The original locations are cleared back to the base background/frame.\n\n---\n\n### Applying that to the test input\n\n**Base template (kept everywhere except where pasted):**\n- Rows 1\u20132 are all **4**.\n- For rows 3\u201330: columns 1\u20132 are **1**, columns 15\u201316 are **2**, columns 27\u201328 are **3**, everything else is **7**.\n\n**Markers (isolated 9s) in the test input:**\n- A **2\u00d72 block of 9s** at rows 19\u201320, cols 8\u20139.\n- A **single 9** at (row 21, col 21).\n- A **diagonal pair of 9s** at (26,5) and (27,6).\n\n**Movable pictures (bounding rectangles) and how they\u2019re moved:**\n- The left-top object (rows 4\u20137, cols 3\u20138) has a single 9 \u2192 orient it so frame-colors line up; this becomes a **transpose** (equivalently: rotate CW then flip left-right), then place it so its 9 lands on (21,21).\n- The right object (rows 5\u201313, cols 19\u201326) has a 2\u00d72 9-square \u2192 **rotate 90\u00b0 CCW**, then place it so that 2\u00d72 9-square lands on rows 19\u201320, cols 8\u20139.\n- The middle object (rows 8\u201311, cols 10\u201313) has a diagonal 9-pair \u2192 **flip horizontally**, then place it so the diagonal 9s land on (26,5) and (27,6).\n\nPasting these onto the base template gives the output below.\n\n---\n\n### Output

from the examples:\n\n1. **Identify the background and the fixed frame.**  \n   The grids have a large \u201cbackground\u201d color (most frequent) plus a fixed border/divider that stays unchanged.  \n   In the test: background = **7**, top border = **4**, left border = **1**, right border = **3**, vertical divider = **2** (at columns 14\u201315).\n\n2. **Color 9 marks \u201cregistration points\u201d.**  \n   - **Targets** are the isolated 9-patterns sitting in empty background (they are not attached to other colors).  \n   - **Sources** are the blocks of non-background pixels that contain 9s *connected (through other colors)* to a larger figure.\n\n3. **Match each source to a target by the 9-pattern shape.**\n   - A **2\u00d72 block of 9s** in the source maps to the **2\u00d72 isolated 9 block** target.\n   - A **single 9** in the source maps to the **isolated single 9** target.\n   - A **diagonal pair of 9s** in the source maps to the **diagonal pair** target.\n\n4. **Orient each source block using the frame-colors embedded on its edges.**  \n   Rotate/flip so those frame-colors land on the correct side for the destination panel (top should face the top border color 4; left/right should face the panel\u2019s border/divider colors).  \n   In the test this yields:\n   - 2\u00d72-9 source block: **rotate 90\u00b0 counterclockwise**.\n   - single-9 source block: **transpose (reflect across the main diagonal)**.\n   - diagonal-9 source block: **flip horizontally**.\n\n5. **Translate** each transformed block so its 9s land exactly on the target 9 positions, and **erase** the original source blocks to background.\n\n---\n\nCompleted output

transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Keep the 2-thick framework lines unchanged** (they form the \u201crooms/compartments\u201d) and keep the uniform background of each compartment.\n2. **Find every composite object**: each is one connected group containing color **8**, plus any **9** pixels connected to it (the \u201ccore\u201d), plus any attached pixels of framework-colors (here: 1/2/3/4) that touch the 8-shape.\n3. **Find all clusters of color 9 that are *not* connected to any 8**. These are **destination anchors**.\n4. **Match each composite to an anchor** by matching the *shape/pattern* of its 9-core pixels (single 9, diagonal pair of 9s, 2\u00d72 block of 9s, etc.).\n5. For each matched composite, apply a **rigid transform** (rotate/reflect) so that:\n   - its **9-core pattern matches the anchor\u2019s 9 pattern**, and\n   - its attached framework-colored pixels **face the corresponding framework side** (e.g., color 4 toward the top frame, color 1 toward the left frame, color 2 toward the middle divider, color 3 toward the right frame).\n6. **Translate** the transformed composite so its 9 pixels **exactly coincide** with the anchor 9 pixels.\n7. **Paste** the composite at the destination and **erase** its original location back to the compartment background (here, 7).\n\nFor the test grid, there are **three composites** (with 9-cores: single 9; diagonal 2-pixel 9; and a 2\u00d72 block of 9), and exactly **three matching free 9 anchors** of those same patterns. They are moved and oriented accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Output

the examples show\n\n1. **There is a fixed \u201cframe/divider\u201d** made of thick stripes (different colors on different sides). Those stripes stay unchanged in the output.\n2. Inside the frame are **one or more multi\u2011color objects whose core is cyan (8)**, usually containing **maroon (9) pixels inside**.\n3. There are also **maroon (9) pixels/clusters that are *not connected* to any cyan object**. These act as **destination markers**.\n4. The task is to:\n   - **Remove all stray/isolated noise** (especially maroon dots not used as markers).\n   - For each cyan object, **rotate/flip it so that any frame-colors attached to it end up on the corresponding side**:\n     - top-frame color \u2192 top edge of the object\n     - left-frame color \u2192 left edge\n     - right-frame color \u2192 right edge\n     - (if there\u2019s a divider stripe color, it goes on the side facing the divider)\n   - Then **translate the oriented object** so that its internal maroon (9) pixels **land exactly on the free-standing maroon marker clusters** of the same shape.\n   - The original object locations are cleared back to background.\n\n### Applying to the test\n\n- Background inside the frame is **7**.\n- Fixed stripes are: **top=4**, **left=1**, **divider=2**, **right=3** (kept unchanged).\n- There are **3 cyan objects** (connected components containing 8) and **4 free maroon marker clusters**:\n  - one **2\u00d72 block** of 9s (destination for the object that contains a 2\u00d72 9 block),\n  - three **single 9 markers** (destinations for objects whose 9s are singletons; one object has two separate single 9s).\n- Required orientations:\n  - The large right object is rotated **90\u00b0 counterclockwise** so its attached frame colors align (4 on top, 1 on left, 2 on the side toward the divider), then moved onto the 2\u00d72 marker block.\n  - The mid-left object is **horizontally flipped** so its 1 moves to the left side and its two single 9s match the two single markers, then moved onto those.\n  - The small top-left object is **transposed (main-diagonal mirror)** so 4 is on top and 3 is on the right side, then moved onto the remaining single 9 marker.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,1,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3  \n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,1,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"H\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the two solved examples)\n\n1. **Identify the fixed frame/dividers and keep them unchanged.**  \n   In these puzzles there are thick \u201cstripes\u201d that form a frame/divider (in the examples: colored borders and/or a central divider). They stay exactly where they are in the output.\n\n2. **Find the movable objects: the main light-cyan shapes.**  \n   Each movable object is a **4-connected component containing color 8**, and it also includes any other non-background pixels attached to it (notably color 9 \u201cmaroon\u201d pixels and small \u201ctab\u201d pixels in border colors).\n\n3. **Find the destination markers: maroon (9) pixels that are NOT connected to any cyan object.**  \n   These detached 9-pixels (sometimes forming a small pattern like a block or a diagonal pair) are **targets** that indicate where objects must end up.\n\n4. **Match each cyan object to exactly one maroon target by the pattern of its internal maroon pixels (up to rotation/reflection).**  \n   The arrangement of 9-pixels inside an object (single, pair, 2\u00d72 block, diagonal pair, etc.) is matched to a target 9-pattern.\n\n5. **Orient (rotate/reflect) the whole object so its \u201ctab\u201d colors match the side-colors of the frame at the destination.**  \n   Border colors act like \u201cdirection labels\u201d: after transformation, any attached border-color pixels end up on the corresponding side (top/left/right, and the divider-side if present). This selects a unique symmetry (rotation/flip).\n\n6. **Translate the oriented object so its maroon pixels land exactly on the target maroon pixels.**  \n   Then **erase the object from its original location** (replace with background), leaving only the relocated objects.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n- **Background inside the play area** is 7.  \n- **Fixed stripes**: top two rows are 4; left border is 1; right border is 3; central divider columns are 2.

Top 2 rows of color **4**\n   - Left border (first 2 columns) of color **1**\n   - Middle divider (columns 15\u201316) of color **2**\n   - Right border (last 2 columns) of color **3**\n\n2. **Background vs. objects**\n   - The dominant interior color is the **background** (here: **7**).\n   - Everything else inside the compartments (not part of the fixed frame) forms **movable objects**.\n\n3. **Sockets (targets) are the detached color-9 patterns**\n   - Find all color **9** pixels that are **not connected to the main objects** (they sit alone elsewhere).  \n   - Group them by their pattern (in this task, diagonal-touching 9\u2019s act like one \u201csocket pattern\u201d).\n   - Each socket pattern tells where an object\u2019s **own internal 9-pattern (\u201cplug\u201d)** must end up.\n\n4. **Match each object to the socket with the same 9-pattern**\n   - Extract each object\u2019s set of 9-cells (its \u201cplug\u201d pattern).\n   - Pair it with the socket having the same shape (up to rotation/flip).\n\n5. **Orient each object before placing**\n   Rotate/flip the object so that any colors that match the destination compartment borders lie on the corresponding **edge of the object\u2019s bounding box**:\n   - Color **4** \u2192 top edge (because the frame has a top stripe of 4)\n   - Color **1** \u2192 left edge if placed in the left compartment\n   - Color **2** \u2192 right edge if placed against the divider in the left compartment\n   - Color **3** \u2192 right edge if placed in the right compartment\n   (This is exactly what the examples show: objects are rotated/flipped so their \u201cborder-colored tabs\u201d point to the matching borders.)\n\n6. **Translate the oriented object so its 9-cells exactly overlap the socket 9-cells**\n   Then erase the original object positions (replace by background).\n\n---\n\n### Completed output grid\n\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,1,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,1,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"J\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_7_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Observations (from the solved examples)\n1. Each puzzle has a **frame** (thick colored borders/stripes) and a large **background color** inside it.\n2. Inside the background there are:\n   - **Movable multicolor objects** (made mostly of one color, plus some \u201cframe-colored\u201d pixels and at least one `9`).\n   - Separate **\u201cmarker\u201d clusters of color `9`** that are *not attached* to any other color (they\u2019re isolated from the objects).\n3. In the output:\n   - The original objects are **removed** from where they started.\n   - Each object is **moved** so that its internal `9` pixels **exactly overlap** one marker-cluster of `9`s.\n   - Each object is also **rotated/flipped** so that any pixels whose colors match the frame end up on the matching **side of the object**:\n     - top-frame color \u2192 top edge of the object,\n     - left-frame color \u2192 left edge,\n     - right-frame color \u2192 right edge,\n     - (and similarly for any internal divider stripe acting as a border for a compartment).\n\n### How to solve the test\n1. **Background** is `7`. The frame is: top rows `4`, left border `1`, middle divider `2`, right border `3`.\n2. Find **marker clusters**: the `9`s that are not connected to other colors (grouped with diagonal-touching too).  \n   Here they form 3 clusters: a **2\u00d72 block**, a **diagonal pair**, and a **single**.\n3. Find the **3 objects** (connected non-background components) and match each to a marker cluster by the **shape/number of `9` pixels inside the object** (4, 2, 1 respectively).\n4. For each object, choose the **unique rotation/flip** that puts its frame-colored pixels on the correct sides (e.g. `4` on top edge, `1` on left edge, `2` on right edge, `3` on right edge where applicable).\n5. **Translate** the oriented object so its `9` pixels land exactly on the marker-cluster coordinates.\n6. Output = frame + background + the relocated objects.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n```text\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,1,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,1,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"4\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Algorithm Discovery and Analysis for an ARC Task**\n\nI'm tackling an ARC problem involving grids with colored regions and patterned \"pixel\" shapes. My initial focus is on understanding the fundamental grid structure: background colors and any regular patterns, especially vertical stripes. I\u2019m starting by closely analyzing the two provided examples and a test case, working row by row and noting dimensions, colors, and repeating elements.\n\nThe examples present a two-panel structure with object-like pixels inside. I notice that input and output grids share the same overall structure, but the content in the panels changes. The goal seems to be to transform pixels from one panel into another. My first hypothesis is that the task involves assembling shapes scattered across panels. A vertical \"Flip\" transformation appears frequently.\n\nExample 1 is key. The input appears to be the \"exploded\" or scattered components. The output forms a rotated-ish, compact shape in the destination panel. The question is how to transform the \"messy\" pixels into a target image. I need to understand this transformation process \u2013 how scattered parts become a coherent whole and how the pixels move around or interact.\n\nMy analysis reveals a panel swap and a Transpose operation where pixels change position according to the relationship `(r, c) -> (c + 1, r - 1)` relative to the top of the panel and a 7 at the very top. This operation handles the movement and structure change in the example. I need to figure out exactly how pixel coordinates map and how to apply the transposition, particularly regarding the bounding box and pixel placement.\n\nThe test input confirms the hypothesis of panel swap and object transformation. It will allow me to apply the findings from the examples to a new structure and check the generalization of the transformation. The key element is to figure out the exact Transpose and placement for all pixel locations.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid based on the patterns observed in the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Task:**\n1.  **Structure:** The grids are divided into two main panels by vertical dividers.\n    *   **Example 1:** Left Panel (Cols 2-11), Right Panel (Cols 14-23). Background color 5. Dividers `1,1` and `2,2`.\n    *   **Example 2:** A single large panel bounded by `4,4` and `7,7`, but containing two implicit regions.\n    *   **Test Input:** Left Panel (Cols 2-13, Width 12), Right Panel (Cols 16-25, Width 10). Background color 7. Dividers are `1,1` (Left), `2,2` (Middle), `3,3` (Right). Rows 0-1 are headers (`4,4...`). The panels effectively start from Row 2.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   The contents of the Left Panel and Right Panel are **swapped**.\n    *   During the swap, the objects undergo a **Transpose** transformation with a specific offset.\n    *   Based on Example 1, the mapping from a source pixel at `(row, col)` to a target pixel `(row', col')` is:\n        *   Determine row relative to the panel start (`r_rel`). In the Test Input, panels start at Row 2.\n        *   Determine column relative to the panel start (`c_rel`).\n        *   Apply the transformation:\n            *   `r'_rel = c_rel + 1`\n            *   `c'_rel = r_rel - 1`\n        *   Convert back to absolute coordinates in the **target** panel.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Left Panel (Source) -> Right Panel (Target):**\n        *   Source Objects:\n            *   **Object 1 (Top Left):** 8s, 9s, 4, 3s. Located at Rows 3-6.\n                *   Example pixel: `4` at Row 5, Col 2 (relative col 0).\n                *   `r_rel = 5-2 = 3`. `c_rel = 0`.\n                *   `r'_rel = 0 + 1 = 1`. `c'_rel = 3 - 1 = 2`.\n                *   Target: Right Panel (Start Col 16). Absolute Row `2+1=3`. Absolute Col `16+2=18`.\n            *   **Object 2 (Bottom Right):** 4, 9, 8, 1. Located at Rows 7-10.\n                *   Example pixel: `1` at Row 9, Col 12 (relative col 10).\n                *   `r_rel = 7`. `c_rel = 10`.\n                *   `r'_rel = 10 + 1 = 11`. `c'_rel = 7 - 1 = 6`.\n                *   Target: Right Panel. Absolute Row `13`. Absolute Col `16+6=22`.\n    *   **Right Panel (Source) -> Left Panel (Target):**\n        *   Source Object (Messy collection of 1, 8, 9, 4, 2): Located at Rows 4-12.\n        *   Example pixel: `1` at Row 4, Col 20 (relative col 4).\n        *   `r_rel = 2`. `c_rel = 4`.\n        *   `r'_rel = 4 + 1 = 5`. `c'_rel = 2 - 1 = 1`.\n        *   Target: Left Panel (Start Col 2). Absolute Row `7`. Absolute Col `2+1=3`.\n        *   Example pixel: `2` at Row 12, Col 24 (relative col 8).\n        *   `r_rel = 10`. `c_rel = 8`.\n        *   `r'_rel = 9`. `c'_rel = 9`.\n        *   Target: Left Panel. Absolute Row `11`. Absolute Col `11`.\n\n4.  **Verification:**\n    *   The transformed width of the Left Panel content (originally width 12, height ~10) fits into the Right Panel (Width 10). specifically, the max relative row index in source is 10, so `c'_rel` max is 9. Matches width 10.\n    *   The transformed width of the Right Panel content (originally width 10, height ~10) fits into the Left Panel (Width 12). specifically, the max relative row index in source is 12 (from row 14? No max row is 12 -> rel 10), so `c'_rel` max is 9. Matches width 12 easily.\n\n**Step-by-step Construction of Output:**\n*   Initialize output grid with 7s in the panels and copy static borders/dividers.\n*   **Process Left Panel Source:**\n    *   Pixels at (3,4) [8] -> T(1,2) -> R3, C18 (Right Panel C2).\n    *   Pixels at (5,2) [4] -> T(3,0) -> R5, C16? Wait.\n        *   (5,2): `r_rel=3`, `c_rel=0`. `r'=1`, `c'=2`. Target (3, 18).\n    *   Let's execute the logic systematically for the final grid.\n\nOutput Grid Generation:\n4,4,4...

The inputs and outputs are grids where each number represents a color. The task seems to be about figuring out the pattern of change from the input to the output.\n\nFirst, I looked at the grid structure. The examples show that the grids are fairly large and seem to have a recurring pattern. I broke down the grid into segments to pinpoint the important segments. There are clear borders and vertical dividers. The main action happens inside these vertical dividers.\n\nThe initial hunch was that the transformation might be a simple swap or some sort of rotation. But that's where things got tricky. I tested a bunch of theories. I looked at horizontal flips, vertical flips, and even 180-degree rotations. None of those worked directly. I started looking at the shapes within the panels and found patterns. The key was to look for the bounding box of non-background elements.\n\nEventually, it looked like a combination of transformations that was happening. It's like the shapes are being flipped AND moved. The movement seemed to relate to a vertical flipping of the elements. I kept trying to fit those observations into patterns. It's like \"reflection and position\" but there was a pattern on HOW the positions changed.\n\nAfter a bunch of back and forth, I saw the pattern. The panel content seems to be rotated 180 degrees. This rotation occurs relative to the panels, and the rotation is happening independently on each panel. I found a way to map the input position to output position using the equation: `Output = (H-1- row, W-1- col)`.\n\nThe final plan is:\n1.  Identify vertical dividers and grid borders.\n2.  The content is divided into panels defined by the dividers and borders.\n3.  Each panel gets its content flipped 180 degrees using a position translation defined by height and width as defined above.\n4.  Background pixels (like 7) are empty.\n5.  Border pixels are preserved.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we identify the transformation rule by observing the changes from the input grids to the output grids in the provided examples.\n\n**Analysis of Example 1:**\nThe grid is divided into two main panels by a vertical divider (columns 12-13, color 4).\n- **Left Panel:** Columns 2-11 (Width 10).\n- **Right Panel:** Columns 14-23 (Width 10).\n- The borders (columns 0-1 and 24-25) and the background (color 5) define the frame.\nComparing the Input to the Output:\n- The content of the Left Panel in the Output corresponds to the content of the Left Panel of the Input, but **rotated 180 degrees** (flipped vertically and horizontally).\n- Similarly, the content of the Right Panel in the Output corresponds to the content of the Right Panel of the Input, rotated 180 degrees.\n- Note: In Example 1, there was a potential swap of panels, but closer inspection of Example 2 suggests a simpler per-panel rotation.\n\n**Analysis of Example 2:**\nThe grid has a frame (rows 0-1, 24-25 and columns 0-1, 24-25).\n- The inner content (rows 2-23, columns 2-23) contains shapes on a background of color 1.\n- Top Object (rows 3-6) moves to the bottom (rows 11-14) and is flipped vertically and horizontally relative to the center of the available space.\n- Bottom Object (rows 10-15) moves to the top/bottom (rows 17-22) and is similarly inverted.\n- The transformation is consistent with rotating the active area of each panel 180 degrees.\n\n**Rule for Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Structure:**\n    -   **Global Frame:** Rows 0-1 are color 4.\n    -   **Left Border:** Columns 0-1 (color 1).\n    -   **Right Border:** Columns 26-27 (color 3).\n    -   **Vertical Divider:** Columns 14-15 (color 2).\n    -   This creates two panels within Rows 2-29:\n        -   **Left Panel:** Columns 2-13 (Width 12).\n        -   **Right Panel:** Columns 16-25 (Width 10).\n    -   **Background Color:** 7.\n\n2.  **Transformation:**\n    -   Preserve the global frame (Rows 0-1) and the vertical columns (Borders and Divider).\n    -   For each panel (Left and Right) within the vertical range [Row 2, Row 29]:\n        -   **Rotate the content 180 degrees.**\n        -   This is equivalent to mapping a pixel from Input `(r, c)` to Output `(r', c')` where:\n            -   `r' = 29 - (r - 2) + 2 = 31 - r`.\n            -   `c' = (Width - 1) - c` (relative to the panel start).\n\n3.  **Applying the Transformation:**\n    -   **Left Panel (Cols 2-13):**\n        -   Input Bottom shapes (`9`s at R18-R26) rotate to become Output Top shapes (R5-R13).\n        -   Input Top shapes (`8,9,3,4` etc. at R3-R10) rotate to become Output Bottom shapes (R21-R28).\n    -

Inside the background are a few multi\u2011colored objects that each contain one or more **9** pixels, and elsewhere there are small **9\u2011only marker patterns**.  \nThe task is to **move each object onto the marker that matches the object\u2019s 9\u2011pattern**, while keeping the frame unchanged and erasing the objects from their original locations.\n\n**How to do it (inferred from the examples):**\n1. **Background** is the most common interior color (here it is **7**).\n2. The constant bars/stripes (here: top rows of **4**, left border **1**, middle divider **2**, right border **3**) are **fixed**.\n3. Find **marker patterns**: groups of **9**s that are isolated from other colors (here we also treat diagonally-touching 9s as one marker shape, matching how the 9-patterns are used).\n4. Find **movable objects**: connected non\u2011background components that include **9** plus other colors.\n5. **Match** each object to the marker with the same 9\u2011shape:\n   - single 9 \u2194 single\u20119 marker\n   - 2\u00d72 block of 9s \u2194 2\u00d72 marker\n   - diagonal pair of 9s \u2194 diagonal\u2011pair marker\n6. **Orient** (rotate/flip) each object so that any frame-colors it contains end up on the corresponding side in its destination region (this disambiguates symmetric 9\u2011patterns), then **translate** it so its 9s land exactly on the marker 9s.\n7. **Erase** the object from its original location (restore to background), leaving only the moved copies.\n\n**Applied to the test input:**\n- Object with **2\u00d72 block of 9s** (originally in the right area) is rotated **90\u00b0 CCW** so its internal **4** is on top, **1** on the left, **2** on the right, then moved so its 2\u00d72 9-block lands on the marker at rows 19\u201320, cols 8\u20139.\n- Object with a **single 9** (top-left cluster with 3s and a 4) is **transposed** (swap rows/cols) so **4** is on top and **3** on the right, then moved so its 9 lands on the marker at (21,21).\n- Object with a **diagonal pair of 9s** is **horizontally flipped** to match the marker\u2019s diagonal direction and put the internal **1** on the left, then moved onto the diagonal marker at (25,5) and (26,6).\n\nCompleted output

My job is to figure out the rules from two solved examples and apply it to a test input. Let\u2019s break down my thought process:\n\n**Initial Analysis and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nI need to understand what constitutes a \u201cmovable object,\u201d how they\u2019re identified, and how they\u2019re transformed and moved based on the given examples. I recognize the key concepts:\n\n1.  **Framework:** The grid boundaries and colored \"walls\" define the spatial context.\n2.  **Movable Objects:** The fundamental unit is not simply an \"8\" pixel, but rather a *composite*. This includes a cluster of \"8\"s (core) that are connected (using the basic 4-connectivity rule) plus any \"9\" pixels it's connected to, and any additional adjacent pixels of other colors (attachments).\n3.  **Anchors:** These are single \"9\" pixels or clusters of isolated \"9\" pixels *not* touching any \"8\" pixels.\n4.  **Transformation:** Objects need to be rotated and/or flipped so that the attached pixels face the appropriate \u201cframework-color side\u201d in the target location, which is defined by the walls in the room the target \"9\" is in.\n5.  **Mapping:** Objects will be moved to the location of the anchor they match.\n\n**Example 1 Deep Dive:**\n\n*   In Example 1, there are two distinct rooms. The object in the left room had a core cluster of \"8\"s, a \"9\", and some additional \"2\" (bottom) and \"4\" (top) pixels. The right room's object has another set of \"8\"s and \"9\"s with an additional pixel attachment on top.\n*   The \"9\" that is attached to the 8s in the right room becomes important, as there is another, solitary \"9\" in the opposite room.\n*   The key is: Identify the movable object and the anchor points.\n*   Here, one object has a single 9; the other has a horizontal pair of 9s, and they swap places!\n*   The horizontal pixel becomes vertical: It's all about attaching pixels to the correct \"walls.\"\n*   Since the goal is matching the framework walls, I'm thinking 90-degree rotations.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   This time, there\u2019s a big room with different colored walls on each side, with a central divider.\n*   I look for the framework colors and the objects. There's a single 9 at one end and an object with two.\n*   The horizontal \"9\" is attached to the object on one side.\n*   I can see the framework is all about the wall attachments again.\n*   There's also some diagonal connectivity in Object 2. This suggests I need to be *very* careful with the pixel layout.\n*   So, a lot of connectivity questions come up. Are parts of one object?\n*   There's an isolated 9 (Anchor). There's also the 9s *within* the objects (which *cannot* be anchors since they are attached to \"8\"s).\n*   Since two clusters have the horizontal, 9 at the bottom and the other, single 9 (Anchor).  I'm thinking those should swap.\n*   I check connectivity: Is the cluster connected or not?\n*   In the second example, object 1 is moved to object 2 and gets vertically flipped to face north\n\n**General Rules and Pattern Recognition:**\n\n*   Based on my analysis, the transformation rules involve either rotations or flips to make the object's attached pixels match the destination wall colors and \"9\" positions.\n*   I recognize the critical element is the *pattern* of 9s. Single 9s are matched to single 9s, pairs to pairs, and so on.\n*   The attached colors act like a key to decide the exact transform.\n\n**Test Input Approach:**\n\n*   I start by finding the \"8\" clusters and the \"9\" clusters.\n*   I identify what pixels are attached and how these can be translated to match the framework, specifically the \u201cwalls\u201d.\n*   I see three objects (A, B, and C) which each have an isolated or 2x2 cluster of 9s attached to them.\n*   Object A is facing left and has a \"9\" attached.\n*   Object B has an object cluster with the \"9\" attached.\n*   Object C has a 2x2.\n*   Three separate rooms! Each contains a 9 and object. The goal is to move the objects to their destination.\n*   Object A\n\nThe transformation involves identifying composite \"movable objects\" (color 8 shapes with color 9 cores and various attachments) and \"destination anchors\" (isolated clusters of color 9).\n\n**Logic:**\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   **Object A:** Located in the left region (cols 2-13, rows 3-6). Core is a single 9 at (4,5). Attachments are color 4 (facing West) and color 3 (facing South).\n    *   **Object B:** Located in the left region (cols 2-13, rows 8-11). Core is a diagonal pair of 9s at (8,10) and (9,9). Attachment is color 1 (facing East).\n    *   **Object C:** Located in the right region (cols 16-25, rows 6-13). Core is a 2x2 square of 9s at (6,21) to (7,22). Attachments are color 4 (facing East) and color 2 (facing South).\n\n2.  **Identify Anchors:**\n    *   **Anchor 1 (Left Room):** 2x2 square of 9s at (18,7)-(19,8). Matches Object C's core.\n    *   **Anchor 2 (Left Room):** Diagonal pair of 9s at (25,4) and (26,5). Matches Object B's core.\n    *   **Anchor 3 (Right Room):** Single 9 at (20,20). Matches Object A's core.\n\n3.  **Determine Transformations:**\n    *   **Object A -> Anchor 3:** Destination room (Right) has walls 4 (North), 3 (East), 2 (West). Object A has attachments 4 and 3. We need 4 to face North and 3 to face East. Original 4 faced West, 3 faced South. The transformation `Transpose` (swap row/col) achieves this (West->North, South->East).\n    *   **Object B -> Anchor 2:** Destination room (Left) has walls 1 (West), 2 (East). Object B has attachment 1. We need 1 to face West. Original 1 faced East. The transformation `Horizontal Flip` achieves this and also matches the diagonal 9-pattern (\"/\" becomes \"\\\").\n    *   **Object C -> Anchor 1:** Destination room (Left) has walls 4 (North), 2 (East), 1 (West). Object C has attachments 4 and 2. We need 4 to face North and 2 to face East. Original 4 faced East, 2 faced South. The transformation `90\u00b0 Counter-Clockwise Rotation` achieves this (East->North, South->East).\n\n4.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   Erase original objects.\n    *   Draw transformed objects at anchor locations.\n\n**Output Grid Calculation:**\n*   **Object A (Transposed):** Center 9 at (20,20). 4 at (17,21). 3s at (18,22), (21,22), (22,22). 8s surrounding accordingly.\n*   **Object B (H-Flipped):** 9s at (25,4), (26,5). 1 at (26,2). 8s surrounding.\n*   **Object C (90\u00b0 CCW):** 9s at (18,7)-(19,8). 4 at (15,7). 2s at (16,13), (17,13), (20,13). 8s surrounding.\n\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,9,8,8,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,8,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,8,3,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,9,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,9,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,9,8,8,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,8,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,8,3,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,9,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,9,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"9\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Detailed Process for Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this ARC problem: The goal is to move shapes within a grid based on some rules. I need to figure out what those rules are by looking at the provided examples and description.\n\nFirst, I'm breaking down the description into key elements. I'm noting that the input is a 2D grid with numbers from 0 to 9, representing different colors or elements. The examples are crucial; they show me how the transformation works. The description focuses on \"framework\" lines (which are 2-pixels wide), \"backgrounds\" of solid colors (separated by framework), and \"composite shapes\" which consist of a primary color 8 (teal-light blue), \"core\" color 9 (maroon/dark red) inclusions, plus optional \"attachments\" in other colors.\n\nThe heart of the transformation is to preserve the framework and background, treat connected composite shapes as movable objects, and find \"destination anchors.\" These anchors are clusters of 9s that *aren't* connected to any 8s. The composite shapes will then be moved to the anchor locations, but there's a catch: the color and orientation of the \"attachments\" must match the color of the adjacent framework. Basically, the colors of things have to line up.\n\nI'm starting my analysis with Example 1. I'm carefully reading the input grid and identifying the framework (the colored lines, in this case, blue, yellow, and red columns). I'm also looking at the color 5 background, and I notice that the compartments are separated by these colored grid lines. I'm focusing on \"source shapes\" and trying to find the 8 and 9 patterns, and looking for which shapes are moving, and which are stationary.\n\nI see shapes with the 8s and 9s. I see that the \"9s\" can be a key or \"anchor\" for translating objects. Looking at input and output, I'm trying to figure out which shape is moved to where. It's becoming clear that there are source shapes (composites with 8s and 9s) and destination spots (isolated 9s). I'm looking for these independent 9s.\n\nI'm carefully re-reading the transformations described in the description and realizing that I have to link the source \"9s\" to destination isolated \"9s\". And for each composite, I have to ensure the 9 pixels in the shape coincide with the anchor. I have to look for isolated \"9\" clusters.\n\nI'm noticing something crucial: the orientation of the shape matters. The description says that the attachments have to face the \"corresponding framework color.\" That implies rotations and/or reflections will be necessary. For Example 1, I see that the framework colors are Blue, Yellow, Red, from Left to Right.\n\nI'm analyzing the example grid, I'm noticing an interesting pattern of 9s in the source shapes: I'm seeing that the 9 in the input's Right compartment moves to the left side and in the output, it ends up rotated, with attachments facing the correct colored walls (the attachment's color has to match the boundary color it's next to). In this case, I deduce the source 9 is moved to be an anchor, or destination point.\n\nI'm working out the transformations. For example, the yellow attachment has to face the yellow framework. This tells me I might need to apply a 90-degree rotation.\nThe left shape must be rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise (CCW). This rotates the shape. I'm working through it to make the math correct.\n\nI'm developing a step-by-step logic:\n1.  **Identify Components:** I'm recognizing the framework walls (columns of solid color), shapes (connected regions of 8s, 9s, and attachments), and anchors (isolated clusters of 9s).\n2.  **Matching:** I'm finding and matching shapes to anchors based on the pattern of their 9-cores (single vs. double, etc.)\n3.  **Transformation:** I'm determining rotations or flips needed to align the attachments (colors) of the shape with the color of the \"framework\" they end up against.\n4.  **Execution:** Clear original shapes, and then draw the transformed shapes at their new location.\n\nFor the example:\n*   I'm looking for a way to use rotation to ensure the corresponding wall and attachment colors align.\n\nNow, I'm taking the \"test input\" the user has provided. I'm carefully going through the input grid, step by step. I'm identifying the framework (cols 0-1, 14-15, 26-27), the background (\n\nThe problem asks us to perform a grid transformation based on identified objects and rules.\n\n**1. Analysis of Objects and Framework**\n*   **Framework/Compartments:** The grid is divided into two main compartments by 2-pixel wide vertical lines.\n    *   **Left Compartment (Cols 2-13):** Bounded by Blue (1) on the left, Red (2) on the right, and Yellow (4) on top (Rows 0-1).\n    *   **Right Compartment (Cols 16-25):** Bounded by Red (2) on the left, Green (3) on the right, and Yellow (4) on top.\n    *   **Background:** Color 7 (Orange).\n*   **Shapes (Source):** Composite objects made of color 8 (teal) with \"cores\" of color 9 (maroon) and attachments of colors 1, 2, 3, 4.\n    1.  **L-Top Shape (Left Comp, Rows 3-6):**\n        *   Core: Single 9 at (4,5).\n        *   Attachments: `4` (Left side, at 5,2), `3` (Bottom side, at 6,3/6/7).\n    2.  **L-Mid Shape (Left Comp, Rows 8-11):**\n        *   Core: Diagonal 9s at (9,10) and (10,9) (Note: Input text analysis corrects coordinates to Row 9,10).\n        *   Attachments: `4` (Top side, at 8,10), `1` (Right side, at 10,12).\n    3.  **R-Shape (Right Comp, Rows 5-13):**\n        *   Core: 2x2 block of 9s at (7,21), (7,22), (8,21), (8,22).\n        *   Attachments: `1` (Top side, at 5,20), `4` (Right side, at 7,25), `2` (Bottom side, at 13,20/23/24).\n*   **Anchors (Destination):** Clusters of 9s in the background, not connected to 8s.\n    1.  **L-2x2 Anchor (Left Comp):** 2x2 block at (18,7)-(19,8).\n    2.  **L-Diag Anchor (Left Comp):** Diagonal pair at (26,4) and (27,5).\n    3.  **R-Single Anchor (Right Comp):** Single 9 at (20,20).\n    4.  **R-Diag Anchor (Right Comp):** Diagonal pair at (26,18) and (27,19).\n\n**2. Transformation Logic**\nWe match source shapes to destination anchors based on the 9-pattern (Core) and orient the shape so its attachments face the compartment walls of the corresponding color.\n\n*   **Move 1: L-Top Shape -> R-Single Anchor**\n    *   **Match:** Single 9 Core matches Single 9 Anchor.\n    *   **Orientation:** Source has `4` (Left), `3` (Bottom). Destination (Right Comp) has Walls: Top (4), Right (3).\n    *   **Transform:** We need `4` to face Top and `3` to face Right.\n    *   **Operation:** Flip Horizontal (Left->Right) then Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW (Right->Top). Or simply **Transpose** (swap row/col offsets).\n        *   `4` (Left) -> Top.\n        *   `3` (Bottom) -> Right.\n    *   **Execution:** Move shape centered at (4,5) to (20,20) with Transpose.\n\n*   **Move 2: L-Mid Shape -> L-Diag Anchor**\n    *   **Match:** Diagonal 9s match L-Diag Anchor.\n    *   **Orientation:** Source has `4` (Top), `1` (Right). Destination (Left Comp) has Walls: Top (4), Left (1).\n    *   **Transform:** We need `4` to stay Top and `1` to face Left.\n    *   **Operation:** **Flip Horizontal**.\n        *   `4` (Top) -> Top.\n        *   `1` (Right) -> Left.\n    *   **Execution:** Move shape centered at (9,10) to (26,4) with Horizontal Flip.\n\n*   **Move 3: R-Shape -> L-2x2 Anchor**\n    *   **Match:** 2x2 9s match L-2x2 Anchor.\n    *   **Orientation:** Source has `1` (Top), `4` (Right), `2` (Bottom). Destination (Left Comp) has Walls: Left (1), Top (4), Right (2).\n    *   **Transform:** We need `1` -> Left, `4` -> Top, `2` -> Right.\n    *   **Operation:** **Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW**.\n        *   `1` (Top) -> Left.\n        *   `4` (Right) -> Top.\n        *   `2` (Bottom) -> Right.\n    *   **Execution:** Move shape from (7,21) to (18,7) with 90\u00b0 CCW Rotation.\n\n*   **Erase:** All original shape pixels are replaced with background (7).\n\n**3. Output Generation**\nThe final grid is constructed by clearing the source shapes and drawing the transformed shapes at the destination coordinates. The R-Diag anchor remains empty as there is no corresponding source shape.\n\noutput:\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,8,8,4,7,7,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,8,8,9,9,8,7,7,8,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,8,9,9,9,8,8,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,8,8,4,7,7,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,4,8,8,9,9,8,7,7,8,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,8,9,9,9,8,8,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"10\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_6_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n\n1. **Identify framework elements**: Top border (rows 0-1, color 4), left border (cols 0-1, color 1), right border (cols 26-27, color 3), vertical divider (cols 14-15, color 2), background color 7.\n\n2. **Identify composite shapes** (8s connected to 9s with attached color pixels):\n   -

Let's break it down:\n\nI'm seeing a pattern where the grid is divided into regions by vertical \"dividers,\" and the content within these regions gets transformed. Ex 1 gave me a clue with a 90-degree clockwise rotation, which made sense given the specific divider color. But the test input has a \"Red\" divider.\n\nLooking closely at Ex 1 and Ex 2, and the structure of Test Input, I've noticed:\n\n1. **Divider Color Matters**: The divider color seems to dictate the transformation. In Ex 1 (yellow divider, color 4), the rule turned out to be a 90-degree Clockwise rotation (verified by mapping pixel coordinates between input and output). Ex 2, having no divider, saw a vertical flip, likely because of the single region structure, so no swapping.\n\n2. **Test Input's Red Divider**:  With the test input sporting a \"Red\" divider (color 2), I started with a vertical flip, given that Ex 2 was a single region and saw a vertical flip. Yet, the sizes of the region did not match with a straight flip. After some consideration, my intuition is telling me that the rule might be a **180-degree rotation** or point reflection, considering that it is 2 and 2 is half of 4.\n\n3. **Size Considerations**: To determine a transformation, I must account for the region sizes. The Test Input has two regions, but they aren't the same size as those in Ex 1. By a few attempts, it has been decided that the interior L region is in indices 3..12, and the R region is indices 16..25, both making a width of 10. Given the 10-wide regions, a rotation of 180 degrees can be handled properly.\n\nThe plan: First extract and isolate the meaningful region, defined by the \"7\" background. The content area, is made of pixels other than 7. Second, for each content pixel (r, c) within the effective L or R region, the rule `(r, c) -> (31 - r, 28 - c)` is applied to map pixels to the resulting output. The dividers, borders, and frame elements are preserved as is.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on patterns inferred from examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Structure:** The grids are divided into vertical panels (regions) separated by vertical bars (dividers) of specific colors.\n    *   **Example 1:** Two regions (Left, Right) separated by a yellow (color 4) divider. The transformation involves rotating the content of the Left region 90 degrees clockwise and moving it to the Right region, and vice versa.\n    *   **Example 2:** A single region (bounded by yellow and orange bars). The transformation is a Vertical Flip of the objects within the region.\n    *   **Test Input:** Two regions separated by a red (color 2) divider.\n        *   Left Region (L): Columns 2-13 (12 columns wide, but effectively 10 columns of content with padding).\n        *   Right Region (R): Columns 16-25 (10 columns wide).\n        *   Divider: Columns 14-15 (Color 2).\n\n2.  **Inferred Rule:** The transformation depends on the color of the vertical divider between regions.\n    *   **Yellow Divider (4) -> Rotate 90\u00b0 Clockwise + Swap Regions.** (From Example 1).\n    *   **No Central Divider (or Frame only) -> Vertical Flip.** (From Example 2).\n    *   **Red Divider (2) -> Rotate 180\u00b0 + Swap Regions.** (Hypothesis for Test Input).\n        *   Color 2 is half of 4, and 180\u00b0 is related to 90\u00b0. 180\u00b0 rotation is equivalent to a point reflection.\n        *   Checking geometry: Rotating the Left region content (10x28) by 180\u00b0 fits perfectly into the Right region (10x28), and vice versa. A 90\u00b0 rotation would not fit (width 25 vs 10).\n\n3.  **Applying the Rule (Point Reflection/180\u00b0 Rotation):**\n    *   We define the \"effective\" content areas for the Left and Right regions.\n        *   Left Content: Rows 2-29, Columns 3-12 (Col 2 and 13 are padding 7s).\n        *   Right Content: Rows 2-29, Columns 16-25.\n    *   The transformation maps every pixel `(r, c)` in the content areas to `(r', c')` such that:\n        *   `r' = 31 - r`\n        *   `c' = 28 - c`\n    *   This formula effectively rotates the combined content area 180 degrees around the center point of the grid (Row 15.5, Col 14).\n    *   Pixels from the Left region map to the Right region, and pixels from the Right region map to the Left region. Background pixels (7) map to background pixels.\n\n**Step-by-Step Construction of Output:**\n1.  Start with a copy of the Test Input to preserve the frame (Rows 0-1 are 4s) and dividers (Cols 0-1 are 1s, Cols 14-15 are 2s, Cols 26-27 are 3s).\n2.  Clear the interior regions (Cols 2-13 and 16-25, Rows 2-29) to the background color 7.\n3.  Iterate through the Test Input's interior regions.

It's all about how these rectangular playgrounds are divided and how the colorful shapes inside move around.\n\nFirst, I noticed the grids are big, with these distinct vertical strips separated by specific colors. The important stuff seems to happen in these \"fields\" within the strips. These fields have things in them (objects) that do all the action.\n\nThe key is figuring out the transformations. So, from looking at a few examples, here's what seems to happen:\n\n-   **Swapping and Rotating:** It looks like, in some cases, the content from one field (like a column) is swapped with another, but there's a rotation involved, like a 90-degree twist (either clockwise or counter-clockwise). This rotation direction could depend on the color of the border around the whole thing, or maybe the type of object. Also, in a few cases, it looked like a 180 flip was happening.\n\n-   **Objects and Color:** There seem to be special objects, defined by their shape and color. So, the output might be these objects moved, rotated, and changed a bit based on the color. Some colors might be the background, and some might act like a \"glue\" for these objects.\n\nWith the analysis, it seems that there are two main types of objects:\nThe ones with odd \"wings\" might lead to a counter-clockwise rotation when swapping fields.\nThe ones with even \"wings\" (or no wings) might lead to a clockwise rotation.\nIt seems that the border color affects the rotation direction.\n\nMy core hypothesis is: it's a combination of swapping field contents, or parts of it, plus rotating them (or other transformations like flipping). The border colors and internal colors might be hints for the precise rules (like the rotation direction).\n\n**To summarize, this is how I would approach the test input:**\n\n*   Identify the Left and Right fields\n*   Examine the objects in both fields\n*   Determine the transformation associated with the border colors (rotate CCW, CW, or flip).\n*   Perform the transformation. Place it in the correct target field.\n*   Draw the output!\n\nThe problem requires transforming the grid based on the properties of the vertical fields and their borders. We identified two main fields in the test input: a Left Field (Color 7, surrounded by Blue border 1) and a Right Field (Color 7, surrounded by Green border 3, with a Red separator 2).\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation rules are inferred as follows:\n1.  **Border Color Codes:**\n    *   **1 (Blue) & 2 (Red):** Rotate content 90\u00b0 Counter-Clockwise (CCW).\n    *   **4 (Yellow):** Rotate content 90\u00b0 Clockwise (CW).\n    *   **7 (Orange):** Vertical Flip.\n    *   **3 (Green):** Inferred to behave symmetrically to 4 (CW) or simply following the pattern that 1,2 are CCW and 3,4 are CW. Given the geometric relationships and the need for the wide Left object to fit into the narrower Right field (and vice versa), the rotations are necessary. We treat **Border 3 as CW**.\n\n2.  **Field Swap:**\n    *   The presence of a separator (Color 2 in Test, Color 4 in Example 1) implies that the contents of the Left and Right fields **swap**.\n    *   Left Content (Border 1 -> CCW) moves to the Right Field.\n    *   Right Content (Border 3 -> CW) moves to the Left Field.\n\n**Transformation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Extract Left Object:**\n    *   Source: Left Field (Cols 3-14), Rows 4-11 (ignoring outliers).\n    *   Operation: **Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW**.\n    *   Target: Right Field (Cols 17-26).\n    *   Position: Maintain vertical start (Row 4), center horizontally in the new field.\n\n2.  **Extract Right Object:**\n    *   Source: Right Field (Cols 17-26), Rows 7-13.\n    *   Operation: **Rotate 90\u00b0 CW**.\n    *   Target: Left Field (Cols 3-14).\n    *   Position: Maintain vertical start (Row 7), center horizontally in the new field.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Copy the input background and borders.\n    *   Clear the inner regions of the Left and Right fields (Color 7).\n    *   Render the transformed objects at their target locations.\n\n**Output Grid Details:**\n*   **Left Field (Cols 3-14):** Contains the Right Object rotated CW.\n    *   Top-Left at (Row 7, Col 5).\n    *   Rows:\n        *   Row 7: `2,8,8,8,8,9,9`\n        *   Row 8: `7,7,7,7,8,9,9` (Background 7 represented as spaces for clarity)\n        *   Row 9: `7,7,7,7,8,8,8`\n        *   Row 10: `2,8,8,8,8,7,8`\n        *   Row 11: `2,8,7,7,7,7,4`\n*   **Right Field (Cols 17-26):** Contains the Left Object rotated CCW.\n    *   Top-Left at (Row 4, Col 18).\n    *   Rows:\n        *   Row 4: `7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7`\n        *   Row 5: `7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7`\n        *   Row 6: `7,7,7,4,9,8,8,7`\n        *   Row 7: `7,7,7,7,7,7,9,8`\n        *   Row 8:

model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. The grids have colored borders (edges and dividers) that define regions\n2. Within each region, there are patterns made of 8s with 9s at the center, plus colored \"markers\" (matching border colors) indicating directional extensions\n3. There are also \"isolated\" 9s (not connected to the 8-patterns)\n4. The transformation moves each 8-pattern to center on the isolated 9 locations in its region\n5. The pattern may be reflected/rotated as needed to align with the isolated 9 positions\n6. The markers update based on which borders are now closest in each direction\n\nFor the test input:\n- **Left region patterns:** One pattern (rows 3-6) moves to isolated 9s at rows 18-19, cols 7-8. Another pattern (rows 7-10) moves to isolated 9s at rows 25-26.\n- **Right region pattern:** The pattern (rows 5-12) moves to the isolated 9 at row 20, col 20.\n\nThe original pattern locations are cleared (replaced with background color 7), and the patterns are reconstructed at the new positions with appropriate marker colors.\n\n```\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,8,8,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,3,7,7,3,3,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,9,8,8,8,4,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,8,8,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,8,8,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,7,7,8,8,7,7,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n```\n

The user wants me to solve an ARC problem. I'm seeing two example grids and a test grid. My approach will be to analyze the examples to understand the transformation rules, then apply them to the test input.\n\n**Example Dissection:**\n\nI'll start by looking at Example 1. The input appears to be vertically segmented into regions with specific colors. It seems a central shape is formed in a specific area.\n\nIn Example 1, the key is the Grey region, divided into vertical regions. The input data's structure seems straightforward: there is noise inside the vertical regions. My initial hypothesis is removing noise from the given data.\n\nThen, I'll move on to Example 2. It's a complete grid with frame colors defining each side, and a blue background inside. I am beginning to recognize objects with vertical symmetry. I will identify the patterns.\n\nThen, there's another clue. I am looking into \"hints\".\n\nHint 1 \"Remove isolated single pixels (noise)\", hint 2 is \"Keep main objects and their maroon parts\" , the last is \"colors from the border appears inside objects\".\n\nAfter going through those hints, I have a clear idea. First identify objects and transform them:\n-   remove single-pixel noise.\n-   use vertical symmetry for objects\n\n**Formulating the Solution:**\n\nThe problem is the edge and the positions of the objects. The examples suggest:\n\n1.  **Denoising:** I'll focus on removing pixels that aren't the primary shapes (teal or maroon). Anything that appears isolated and doesn't belong to a larger connected component of these colors is probably noise.\n2.  **Vertical Flip and Position:** The transformation appears to involve a vertical reflection of the main object components. The objects seem to be reflected, then potentially shifted down.\n3.  **Border Decoration:** Once an object is in its new location, the edge pixels get \"decorated\" with the border colors from its corresponding region. The Top border seems to take priority.\n\n**Test Input application:**\n\nThe test input grid is also divided into regions with color stripes.\nMy process will be:\n\n1.  Initialize output grid with frame colors.\n2.  Identify object locations by identifying connected groups of 8 and 9.\n3.  For each object:\n    *   Flip it vertically to the other side.\n    *   Decorate its edges with border colors from its new region.\n\nLet's do this!\n\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying the \"objects\" (connected components of teal `8`s and maroon `9`s), vertically reflecting their positions across the center of the grid (Row $r \\rightarrow H-1-r$), and then \"decorating\" their edges based on the colors of the surrounding region borders.\n\n**Logic:**\n1.  **Identify Regions:** The grid is divided by vertical stripes.\n    *   **Region 1 (Left):** Columns 2-13. Borders: Top=Yellow(4), Left=Blue(1), Right=Red(2).\n    *   **Region 2 (Right):** Columns 16-25. Borders: Top=Yellow(4), Left=Red(2), Right=Green(3).\n2.  **Filter & Reflect:** Extract the objects (ignoring noise like isolated pixels not belonging to the main shapes). Reflect the entire object configuration vertically (e.g., an object at the top moves to the bottom).\n3.  **Decorate:** Apply border colors to the pixels at the extremities of the reflected objects:\n    *   **Top Edge:** Becomes the Top Border color (Yellow `4`). This takes priority.\n    *   **Left Edge:** Becomes the Left Border color (Blue `1` for Region 1, Red `2` for Region 2).\n    *   **Right Edge:** Becomes the Right Border color (Red `2` for Region 1, Green `3` for Region 2).\n    *   **Internal Pixels:** Remain their original color (`8` or `9`), unless they are on an edge.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Region 1 Object 1 (Small, Top):** Originally at Rows 25-26. Reflects to Rows 3-4.\n    *   Row 3 (Top): Becomes `4`.\n    *   Row 4 (Bottom): Becomes `1` (Left border).\n*   **Region 1 Object 2 (Middle):** Originally at Rows 8-10. Reflects to Rows 19-21.\n    *   Row 19 (Top): `8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `4,4`.\n    *   Row 20: `9,8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `1,8,2` (Left=1, Right=2).\n    *   Row 21: `9,8` $\\rightarrow$ `1,2`.\n*   **Region 1 Object 3 (Bottom):** Originally at Rows 3-5. Reflects to Rows 24-26.\n    *   Row 24 (Top): `8,8,.,8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `4,4,7,4,4`.\n    *   Row 25: `8,9,8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `1,9,8,2`.\n    *   Row 26: `8,.,8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `1,7,8,2`.\n*   **Region 2 Object 1 (Small, Top):** Originally at Rows 18-19. Reflects to Rows 10-11.\n    *   Row 10 (Top): `9,9` $\\rightarrow$ `4,4`.\n    *   Row 11: `9,9` $\\rightarrow$ `2,3` (Left=2, Right=3).\n*   **Region 2 Object 2 (Large, Bottom):** Originally at Rows 6-12. Reflects to Rows 17-23.\n    *   Row 17 (Top): `2,7,7,2,2` $\\rightarrow$ `4,7,7,4,4`.\n    *   Row 18: `8,7,7,8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `2,7,7,8,3`.\n    *   Row 19: `8,8,8,7,7,8` $\\rightarrow$ `2,8,8,7,7,3`.\n    *   Row 20: Same as 19.\n    *   Row 21: `8,8,8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `2,8,8,3`.\n    *   Row 22: `9,9,8` $\\rightarrow$ `2,9,3`.\n    *   Row 23: `9,9,8,8` $\\rightarrow$ `2,9,8,3`.\n\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,4,4,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,4,4,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,8,3,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,8,8,7,7,3,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,2,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,8,8,7,7,3,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,8,8,3,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,9,3,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,9,8,3,7,3,3\n1,1,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,1,9,8,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,1,7,8,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,4,4,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,4,7,7,4,4,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,8,3,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,8,8,7,7,3,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,8,2,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,8,8,7,7,3,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,2,8,8,3,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,9,3,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,2,9,8,3,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,4,4,7,4,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,1,9,8,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,1,7,8,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"16\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Algorithm Formulation and Optimization for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's my understanding of this ARC task.  The goal is to transform grids, and I need to figure out the rules. I'm focusing on two examples and a test case. The core is an object manipulation/transformation. The key seems to be the relationship between object shapes, their colors, and surrounding borders/dividers. The size of the grid is huge.\n\n**Analysis of the input:** I'm seeing rectangular grids with color-coded \"containers\" or panels. These are separated by vertical dividers. Within these, there are shapes made of different colors. I've noted that certain color values represent borders, background, objects, and internal details within objects.\n\n**My Hypotheses:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification and Movement:** I'll begin by detecting objects (clusters of pixels, especially light cyan teal-8 and maroon-9) by filtering the noise. There is a lot of noise. The objects seem to be moving to specific locations. It's likely a form of gravity, but I need to understand what defines the \"floor\" or destination. My working hypothesis is, that the objects fall to the bottom of the section.\n\n2.  **Border-Driven Decoration:** Once objects reach their destination, I'll need to apply transformations to their edges. The hint about \"border-driven edge-decoration\" is vital. Based on the border colors (left, right, top, bottom), specific pixels in the object will be replaced by the border colors. I will need to determine whether the horizontal borders, vertical borders or both, affect the objects.\n\n**Refinement of Hypotheses:**\n\n1.  **Defining the Gravity Destination**: It's not standard gravity. The position of an object might be shifted due to the starting positions and the divider. I'm discarding the possibility that noise pixels act as anchors, which were a hypothesis for a while, because that doesn't hold up consistently. I assume the objects need to fall to the \"bottom of their column\" or some fixed offset.\n\n2.  **Color Transformation and Pixel Coloring Priority**: The colors on the border are the most important. I've observed that specific pixels in the object (usually on the edges) are re-colored to match their surrounding borders. Pixels on horizontal sides are subject to the horizontal border and are colored appropriately. Pixels on the vertical sides are subject to vertical borders. So the top will be colored with the top border, the left will be colored with the left border, etc. There is an interaction between the borders and the pixels that determines the pixel's new value. If a pixel is exposed on more than one side, I need to understand priority. I'm assuming that **Top** overrides the other borders. If that doesn't work, I'll change it to the other order: the Left overrides the Top.\n\n**Test Input application:**\n\nGiven a new test input, I'll follow this plan:\n\n1.  **Reconstruct Background:** Reproduce the original grid background, including border and divider colors.\n\n2.  **Extract Objects:** Filter for the main object pixels. Ignore noise. Reset all colored pixels within the main objects to the base color (8) if they are not maroon (9).\n\n3.  **Placement of Objects:** Place the extracted objects at the bottom of their column.\n\n4.  **Border-Driven decoration:** Apply color changes based on border rules. Assign colors (1, 2, 3, or 4) to exposed edges. Top will be 4 in all the cases.\n\n5.  **Output Generation**: Compose the final output grid and write it as text in the specified format. The output has to be the full grid.\n\n6.  **Edge Priority**. Top is always the dominant color.\n\n7.  **Preservation of Inner Colors**: Do not touch the value of pixels 9.\n\nTo solve this task, we first analyze the transformation logic based on the provided examples.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Grid Structure:**\n- The grids consist of vertical \"panels\" defined by colored borders and dividers.\n- **Test Input Borders:**\n  - **Top:** Rows 0-1 are filled with Yellow (4).\n  - **Left:** Columns 0-1 are Blue (1).\n  - **Divider:** Columns 14-15 are Red (2), separating the grid into a Left Panel and a Right Panel.\n  - **Right:** Columns 26-27 are Green (3).\n  - **Background:** The empty space inside the panels is Orange (7).\n\n**2. Transformation Rules:**\n- **Object Identification:** We identify \"objects\" inside the panels. These are clusters of Teal (8) and Maroon (9) pixels. We ignore isolated \"noise\" pixels (like the scattered maroon dots at the bottom or isolated border-colored pixels) and focus on the main connected shapes.\n  - *Left Panel Object:* Located at rows 4-6.\n  - *Right Panel Object:* Located at rows 7-10.\n- **Gravity:** The objects fall to the bottom of the grid (or the bottom of their respective panels).\n  - In the test input, the grid has 30 rows. The objects will be moved so that their lowest pixels rest on Row 29.\n- **Decoration (Coloring):** Once the objects settle, their boundary pixels change color based on the panel borders they are \"exposed\" to.\n  - **Priority:** Top/Bottom borders seem to take precedence over Left/Right borders based on Example 2. Maroon (9) internal details are preserved and not overwritten.\n  - **Left Panel Logic:**\n    - Left Border: Blue (1).\n    - Right Border: Red (2).\n    - Top Border: Yellow (4).\n    - *Rule:* Exposed Top pixels -> 4. Exposed Left pixels -> 1. Exposed Right pixels -> 2.\n  - **Right Panel Logic:**\n    - Left Border: Red (2).\n    - Right Border: Green (3).\n    - Top Border: Yellow (4).\n    - *Rule:* Exposed Top pixels -> 4. Exposed Left pixels -> 2. Exposed Right pixels -> 3.\n\n**3. Applying the Transformation:**\n\n**Left Object:**\n- Original Shape (from rows 4-6, columns 2-13):\n  - Row 0 (top): Pixels at relative offsets corresponding to `..8.88`\n  - Row 1: `8988..`\n  - Row 2 (bottom): `888.88` (treating the yellow `4` noise as part of the teal `8` shape).\n- Destination: Rows 27-29.\n- **Decoration:**\n  - **Row 27 (Top of object):** All top-facing `8`s become Top Border Color (4).\n  - **Row 28:**\n    - Leftmost `8` is Top-exposed (due to shape gap) -> 4.\n    - `9` is preserved.\n    - Rightmost `8` is Right-exposed -> 2.\n  - **Row 29 (Bottom of object):**\n    - Leftmost `8` is Top-exposed -> 4.\n    - Next `8` is Top-exposed -> 4.\n    - `8` with gap on right -> 2.\n    - `8` with gap on left -> 1.\n    - Rightmost `8` is Right-exposed -> 2.\n\n**Right Object:**\n- Original Shape (from rows 7-10, columns 16-25):\n  - Row 0 (top): `.....998..`\n  - Row 1: `.....98...`\n  - Row 2: `....888...` (treating `1` noise as `8`).\n  - Row 3 (bottom): `....88....`\n- Destination: Rows 26-29.\n- **Decoration:**\n  - **Row 26:** Top `8`s -> 4. `9`s preserved. Right `8` -> 3 (Right Border).\n  - **Row 27:** Right `8` -> 3.\n  - **Row 28:** Left `8` is Top-exposed -> 4. Right `8` -> 3.\n  - **Row 29:** Left `8` -> 2 (Left Border).

The user wants me to crack an ARC puzzle. Two examples are provided, and then a test input. The task seems to involve reshaping objects within a grid.\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe main focus is on how shapes move between two regions separated by wall-like dividers. The output grids demonstrate a change in object arrangement or position.\n\nLet's break down Example 1. There are rooms with scattered object parts that are re-assembled in the other room. Initially, I thought it was a 90 CCW rotation and room swap. However, after careful tracing and the \"image\" output provided, it is clearer that it's a 180-degree rotation. The rotation is what makes the components seem to be swapped/assembled.\nI confirmed it again on example two, and realized it's a 180 rotation combined with room swap and point reflection.\n\nExample 2 showed a full grid with objects across it. There is a top object, and a bottom object. The output shows a reflected-swap of those objects across a midpoint in the grid.\n\nThese examples make me think there's a principle, especially with walls and borders being intact. I think there is a 180 rotation and object-focused reflection at the grid-center.\n\nThis becomes my main strategy: Extract the core objects in each region. Filter out the single-pixel \"noise\" objects. Reflect and assemble the objects. Rebuild the walls and background.\n\n**Test Input application**\n\nThe Test Input is next. I am now applying the algorithm on it.\n\nI'm thinking that it may involve a 90 rotation because the object's width is wider than the region's width. But maybe 180 still?\n\nI believe the most reliable approach is to exclude the wall colors from the \"object\" and exclude single-pixel clusters.\n\nI'm betting I need a 90 rotation. Because a 180 might cause clipping. But I'll need the right rotation direction. Test input has object widths/lengths that won't fit into the space with 180.\nSo it's either 90 degrees or it has to fit exactly, by excluding some.\n\nI am re-analyzing the rotation. The user's input of an ARC task is important.\n\n**Final Plan**\n\nHere's the detailed plan I'm implementing:\n\n1.  Analyze the input grid. Determine backgrounds, walls, borders, and regions.\n2.  Identify core objects and remove noise objects with a count less than two pixels.\n3.  Perform a 90 CCW rotation.\n4.  Reflect the object positions across the center of each room to move between regions.\n5.  Position objects.\n6.  Draw the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid based on the pattern observed in the examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The grids are divided into two main \"rooms\" by vertical walls.\n    *   Example 1: Left Room (cols 2-11), Right Room (cols 14-23).\n    *   Example 2: A single large room, but the transformation swaps objects between top-left and bottom-right, behaving like two zones.\n    *   Test Input: Left Room (cols 2-13), Right Room (cols 16-25).\n2.  **Object Identification**: Inside these rooms, there are shapes made of non-background colors. We observe \"main\" multi-colored objects and some smaller single-pixel \"noise\" or disconnected fragments.\n    *   In the examples, the single-pixel disconnected fragments (noise) are removed in the output.\n    *   The main connected components are preserved and transformed.\n3.  **Transformation Logic**:\n    *   **Swap Rooms**: The object from the Left Room moves to the Right Room, and the object from the Right Room moves to the Left Room.\n    *   **Rotation**: The objects are rotated **180 degrees** (Point Reflection).\n        *   Example 1: The \"C\" shape opens Right $\\rightarrow$ Output opens Left. Yellow Top $\\rightarrow$ Yellow Bottom. (180 deg).\n        *   Example 2: The \"L\" shape has Yellow Left $\\rightarrow$ Output Red Left (Yellow Right). Wait, 180 deg means Yellow Left $\\rightarrow$ Yellow Right. Top $\\rightarrow$ Bottom.\n    *   **Vertical Positioning**:\n        *   In Example 2, an object at the Top moves to the Bottom. An object in the Middle/Bottom moves to the Top. This indicates a **Vertical Reflection** of the position relative to the room's height.\n        *   $Row_{new} = Height_{room} - Row_{old} + Offset$.\n        *   In Example 1, the vertical movement is less drastic but consistent with centering or reflecting within the active zone.\n        *   For the Test Input, which shares the \"Top Wall\" feature with Example 2, we will apply **Vertical Reflection** (Top $\\rightarrow$ Bottom).\n    *   **Horizontal Positioning**: The objects are **centered horizontally** within their new rooms.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Parse Input**:\n    *   **Background**: 7 (Orange).\n    *   **Left Room**: Cols 2-13 (Width 12). Contains a multicolored \"Lamp/Tree\" shape at the top (Rows 3-10).\n    *   **Right Room**: Cols 16-25 (Width 10). Contains a multicolored shape at the top (Rows 4-13).\n    *   **Walls**: Yellow (4) at top, Blue (1) left, Red (2) middle, Green (3) right.\n\n2.  **Process Left Object**:\n    *   **Source**: Rows 3-10, Cols 2-12. (Center roughly Row 6.5).\n    *   **Action**: Rotate 180 degrees.\n    *   **Target**: Right Room (Cols 16-25).\n    *   **Vertical Position**: Reflect across the room height (Rows 2-29).\n        *   Input is at Top. Output goes to **Bottom**.\n        *   New rows approx 21-28.\n    *   **Horizontal Position**: Center in Right Room.\n\n3.  **Process Right Object**:\n    *   **Source**: Rows 4-13. (Center roughly Row 8.5).\n    *   **Action**: Rotate 180 degrees.\n    *   **Target**: Left Room (Cols 2-13).\n    *   **Vertical Position**: Reflect to **Bottom**.\n        *   New rows approx 18-27.\n    *   **Horizontal Position**: Center in Left Room.\n\n4.  **Noise Removal**: Small isolated pixels (like the `9`s at row 19, 26) are treated as noise and removed.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   Start with the base grid (Walls and Background).\n*   Place the transformed Left Object into the Right Room (bottom).\n*   Place the transformed Right Object into the Left Room (bottom).\n\n**Output Grid**:\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,8,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,8,8,1,8,8,9,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,4,8,8,9,9,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,3,3,7,7,3,7,7,3,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,8,8,7,8,8,4,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,8,8,9,8,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,8,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,8,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,8,8,1,8,8,9,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,4,8,8,9,9,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,3,3,7,7,3,7,7,3,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,8,8,7,8,8,4,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,8,8,9,8,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"19\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_8_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**The Task: A Deep Dive into ARC's Compartmental Swaps and Vertical Flips**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given a couple of examples and a test input, and my job is to solve it. I'm seeing patterns here. I think this involves colored grids that have regions, or \u201ccompartments.\u201d The transformation appears to be about reshuffling the contents.  I'm trying to figure out the underlying logic.\n\nMy mind immediately begins to break down the first example.  I spot a gray background and then vertical colored stripes.  Each compartment seems to contain objects, and, lo and behold, in the output, these objects have moved around!  I'm focusing in on the objects themselves\u2014are they swapped, copied, or reflected?  I need to determine what is the \"object\" and what is noise. I start meticulously tracing colors, reading grid data, and then re-reading the image.  I need to make sure I get this right.  One of the isolated pixels is gone!\n\nI form my first hypothesis: it's a swap! The object on the left, moves to the right and vice versa. However, I notice a lot of noise. This will complicate things. I trace the objects to see if my hypothesis is true.\n\nI meticulously trace pixel by pixel. Oh no, it\u2019s not just a simple swap. I start to analyze the data. Now, a key observation appears. Example 2 has no walls in the middle but the object is clearly \"left\" and \"right\". The pattern is clearly. I've realized noise pixels are irrelevant in these transformations.\n\nAfter analyzing example 2, I form a revised, and more comprehensive plan. I must think of these compartments or zones, then find the objects, then swap their positions. Simple enough, but what about the noise? I start to think.\n\nI discover that the objects are not merely swapping positions; there is a vertical flip involved too! It seems to be a combination of swapping and reflecting. I need to be careful with positioning, because I don\u2019t think objects swap around perfectly. There is a method to the madness!\n\nMy analysis is complete and I've created two rules. The final transformation: swap the objects between the compartments. Remove any noise, and vertically flip the final configuration.\n\nI need to confirm by applying my rules to Test Input. I see an arrangement similar to Example 1: two compartments separated by a vertical wall.  I trace the columns and rows, painstakingly documenting each color and its position. In the test input, I discover two objects on the left and one on the right.  Do I apply the vertical flip to individual components? I must think this through.\n\nI try to visualize the outcome, based on my analysis of the first two examples. My plan begins to take shape.  I need to transform the test input.\n\nI create the output, by creating a new grid with compartments, then populate the flipped and moved objects in the new locations. I realize that I have to apply several transformations: extracting the objects from their original compartments, removing the noise pixels (because those are usually just artifacts), swap the two compartments, and vertically flip. I am ready to implement the final output. The key is in accurately tracking all the transformations, so that the object colors end up in the right place.\n\n\nThe transformation involves identifying the two main compartments separated by vertical walls, identifying the objects within them, and then swapping the contents of the compartments while applying a vertical flip to the objects. \"Noise\" (small isolated clusters or single pixels not part of the main structures) is removed.\n\n**Step-by-Step Logic:**\n\n1.  **Identify Compartments:**\n    *   **Left Compartment:** Columns 2-13 (Width 12).\n    *   **Right Compartment:** Columns 16-25 (Width 10).\n    *   Walls are at Columns 0-1 (Blue), 14-15 (Red), 26-27 (Green), and Rows 0-1 (Yellow).\n\n2.  **Identify Objects (and filter noise):**\n    *   **Left Compartment:**\n        *   **Object A:** Located at Rows 3-6. Spans Columns 2-7. Colors involved: 8 (Teal), 9 (Maroon), 4 (Yellow), 3 (Green).\n        *   **Object B:** Located at Rows 9-10. Spans Columns 9-12. Colors: 9, 8, 1 (Blue).\n        *   Other pixels (e.g., `9`s at Row 19, 26, 27) are treated as noise and removed.\n    *   **Right Compartment:**\n        *   **Object C:** Located at Rows 6-11. Spans Columns 18-25 (roughly). Colors: 9, 8, 4, 2 (Red).\n        *   Other pixels (e.g., `9`s at Row 20, 26) are treated as noise.\n\n3.  **Transformation (Swap & Flip):**\n    *   **Move Right Content to Left:** Object C moves to the Left Compartment.\n    *   **Move Left Content to Right:** Objects A and B move to the Right Compartment.\n    *   **Vertical Flip:** All objects are vertically flipped (top row becomes bottom row, etc.).\n    *   **Vertical Alignment:** Objects are placed starting from the top of the available space (Row 3).\n        *   Object C (flipped) is placed at Row 3 in the Left Compartment.\n        *   Object A (flipped) is placed at Row 3 in the Right Compartment.\n        *   Object B (flipped) is placed below Object A, maintaining the original gap of 2 rows. Since A ends at Row 6 (height 4), B starts at Row 9.\n    *   **Horizontal Alignment:** Objects are horizontally centered within their new compartments.\n        *   **Object C:** Width 8 (Cols 18-25). Centered in Left Compartment (Width 12) starts at relative index 2 (Col 4).\n        *   **Object A:** Width 6 (Cols 2-7).

The main area has a background color with shapes made of 8s.\n\n2. **Key Pattern**: Each shape made of 8s contains internal 9 pixels and has \"marker\" pixels (matching border colors) attached to it. There are also isolated 9 pixels scattered in the grid that don't belong to any shape.\n\n3. **Transformation Rule**: \n   - Identify shapes (clusters of 8s with embedded 9s and color markers)\n   - Identify isolated 9 pixels (not connected to 8-shapes)\n   - Move each shape so its internal 9s align with the isolated 9 positions\n   - The isolated 9s serve as \"target locations\" for the shapes\n   - Shapes may need to be mirrored to match the 9 pattern orientation\n\n**Applying to test input:**\n\n- **Shape 1** (upper-left, single 9 at row 4, col 5) \u2192 moves to isolated 9 at (20, 20)\n- **Shape 2** (middle-left, diagonal 9s) \u2192 moves to isolated diagonal 9s at (25,4) and (26,5), mirrored horizontally\n- **Shape 3** (right side, 2\u00d72 block of 9s) \u2192 moves to isolated 2\u00d72 block at rows 18-19, cols 7-8\n\nThe original shapes and isolated 9s are removed, and shapes are placed at their new target positions with their markers preserved.\n\n```\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,8,4,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,7,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,9,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,4,8,8,7,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,3,7,3,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,4,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,8,4,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,7,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,8,9,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,4,8,8,7,8,8,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,8,8,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,3,7,3,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,8,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,4,7,2,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,1,8,8,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- SELECT THE BEST RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1. It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
