Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Task Understanding and Strategy**\n\nMy primary goal is to decipher and reproduce the pattern observed in a series of solved ARC tasks involving grids of integers (0-9). The core seems to be that small shapes/objects (often colored, denoted by the integers within the grid) generate \"trails\" that extend beyond the shape itself, and I need to figure out how these trails are generated, and in a way that handles edge cases and scale variations.\n\n**Early Observations and Hypotheses**\n\n*   **Background and Objects:** The background is typically 8 (teal). The grids have distinct shapes, objects, which are made of a border and a fill. I'm noting the numbers' structure within the objects.\n*   **Initial Trail Direction:** Initial examination hints at diagonal trails (likely North-West) emanating from the shapes. The output also contains the original shapes as a given.\n*   **Edge Wrapping/Boundary Behavior:** It seems that the trails \"wrap\" or reflect when they reach the edges of the grid. But, this has the nuance that the behavior could be based on a grid composed of smaller subgrids, rather than a whole.\n*   **The notion of vertical columns**: The test example hint to vertical segments. The rule may need to be composed of two separate diagonal and vertical parts.\n\n**Refinement and Algorithm**\n\n*   **Panel/Strip Structure:** The grid is divided into vertical \"strips\" of equal width, determined by the grid size and the number and positioning of objects. The trail behavior changes depending on the strip they are in.\n*   **Diagonal Trails:**\n    *   Trails are created at each corner of the inner box.\n    *   They emanate diagonally (Up-Right/Up-Left/Down-Right/Down-Left)\n    *   Each object has an assigned \"Target Column\". When a ray hits an edge of the Panel in which the shape lives, the ray \"jumps\" to a column within another panel:\n        *   Vertical lines are created at an assigned target column which is computed from the object index and position in the Grid.\n\n**Key Components of the Solution**\n\n1.  **Strip Width and Structure:** Determine the width of the repeating panels.\n2.  **Object-Specific Target Columns**:\n    *   Each object \"projects\" to a unique target column, a vertical line in another Panel. The rule for deriving the exact column needs to be made.\n3.  **Ray Tracing (Diagonal and Vertical):**\n    *   Generate rays from each corner of the inner portion of the object.\n    *   Track the ray as they interact with panel boundaries:\n    *   Draw the initial diagonal line; also compute the vertical segment to draw in the assigned target.\n4.  **Edge Wrapping/Panel Transfer**: Identify that a panel end is a boundary to the current panel, and draw the line in the \"target\" column.\n5.  **Output Generation:** The output is constructed by a combination of the input and the generated trails of color.\n\n\nThe task requires inferring a transformation that extends patterns from \"source objects\" (colored shapes) into \"trails\" (lines of the same color). Based on the solved examples, the transformation involves projecting diagonal rays from the corners of the shapes, which then form vertical lines at specific columns.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The 30x30 grid is treated as three vertical \"panels\" or \"strips\" of width 10 (Columns 0-9, 10-19, 20-29).\n2.  **Object Identification:** There are five objects in the test input. We identify them by their unique fill colors and positions:\n    *   **Maroon (9):** Bottom-left, Panel 0 (Center X $\\approx$ 2).\n    *   **Red (2):** Top-left, Panel 0 (Center X $\\approx$ 4).\n    *   **Yellow (4):** Top-middle, Panel 1 (Center X $\\approx$ 15).\n    *   **Orange (7):** Bottom-right, Panel 2 (Center X $\\approx$ 22).\n    *   **Magenta (6):** Middle-right, Panel 2 (Center X $\\approx$ 23).\n3.  **Target Columns:** Each object projects its color to a specific \"Target Column\" where a vertical line forms. The Target Column is determined by the formula:\n    `Target = (Panel_Index + 1) * 10 + Object_Index_In_Panel`\n    *   **Maroon (9):** Panel 0, Index 0 $\\rightarrow$ Target **10**.\n    *   **Red (2):** Panel 0, Index 1 $\\rightarrow$ Target **11**.\n    *   **Yellow (4):** Panel 1, Index 0 $\\rightarrow$ Target **20**.\n    *   **Orange (7):** Panel 2, Index 0 $\\rightarrow$ Target **0** (Wrap $30 \\to 0$).\n    *   **Magenta (6):** Panel 2, Index 1 $\\rightarrow$ Target **1**.\n4.  **Ray Tracing & Vertical Lines:**\n    *   Diagonal rays extend from the four corners of each object's fill area (UL, UR, DL, DR).\n    *   These rays travel until they intersect the object's **Target Column**. The grid wraps horizontally (Column 29 connects to 0).\n    *   From the intersection point:\n        *   **Upward rays (UL, UR):** Create a vertical line from the intersection row **up to the top** (Row 0) in the Target Column.\n        *   **Downward rays (DL, DR):** Create a vertical line from the intersection row **down to the bottom** (Row 29) in the Target Column.\n    *   The diagonal rays themselves are also drawn on the grid until they hit the grid boundary or target.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Col 10 (Maroon 9):** UR ray from (25,3) hits col 10 at row 18. Vertical 0-18. UL ray hits via wrap at row 3. Vertical 0-3. **Result: 9s at 0-18.**\n*   **Col 11 (Red 2):** DR ray from (6,5) hits col 11 at row 12. Vertical 12-29. DL ray hits via wrap at 29. **Result: 2s at 12-29.**\n*   **Col 20 (Yellow 4):** UR ray from (5,16) hits col 20 at row 1. Vertical 0-1. DR ray from (6,16) hits col 20 at row 10. Vertical 10-29. **Result: 4s at 0-1 and 10-29.**\n*   **Col 0 (Orange 7):** UR ray from (20,23) hits col 0 at row 13. Vertical 0-13. DR ray from (21,23) hits col 0 at row 28. Vertical 28-29. **Result: 7s at 0-13 and 28-29.**\n*   **Col 1 (Magenta 6):** UR ray from (14,24) hits col 1 at row 7. Vertical 0-7. DR ray from (15,24) hits col 1 at row 22. Vertical 22-29. **Result: 6s at 0-7 and 22-29.**\n\nDiagonal lines are added connecting the shapes to these verticals.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,6,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,6,8,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,6,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,6,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8\n7,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n7,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n7,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,7,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,7,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,4,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,4,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,7,7,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment & Strategy**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to figure out the rules for these ARC tasks. I've got four examples, and the general gist seems to be about identifying \"objects\" within a grid and then transforming them. The key seems to be these \"objects\" enclosed by a border and then figuring out how to re-create or extend them in the output. I'll need to look at each example carefully, comparing input and output, identifying patterns, and formulating hypotheses. I suspect it involves shapes, colors, and possibly diagonal extensions or patterns. I'll need to carefully analyze the coordinates and numbers. Let's start with Example 1.\n\n**Example 1: Object & Diagonal Beam Identification**\n\nIn Example 1, I see what looks like a teal background, and some objects. There is green and another inside the borders. The inner ones seem to be maroon, blue, yellow, and magenta. The initial impression is that the inner color shapes are re-created in the output, maybe with some kind of modification. The first object has a 2x2 maroon block. In the output, it looks like diagonals of the same color extend from the corners. It looks like it is an \"X\" shape. The X shape appears to have been added to the corners and sides. In example 1, it appears that the corners and sometimes sides are missing in the Input. The beams seem to be in the \"open\" directions. I'll carefully check this.\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation**\n\nIt's looking like the rule is:\n\n1.  **Identify the \"inner color\" block**: It's the enclosed portion within the border.\n2.  **Check for border holes**: Look for missing border pixels on all sides and corners.\n3.  **Create \"beams\"**: Extend lines of the inner color from the border holes.\n\n**Example 2: Further Analysis**\n\nOkay, let's test it in Example 2. It has an intact border. The rule seems to hold. The corners are NOT missing.\n\n**Example 3: Intersection and Refinement**\n\nHere I have a new situation in Example 3. There is an intersection of colors. My initial strategy is to draw the beams but let them overwrite.\nExample 3, there's a red shape and a yellow shape in the middle. Beams were generated and intersected. These created additional beams. It seems like the collision rule is more complex. Beams are generated and may create new shapes. Looking closer at the example, it looks like, in addition to vertical and horizontal beams, a new diagonal beam is generated at intersection points.\nFor the new diagonal beams, it seems to have two orthogonal (horizontal + vertical) beams meeting and creating a diagonal line.\n\n**Example 4: Rule Refinement and Generalization**\n\nExample 4 doesn't have horizontal and vertical parts, but only diagonal. All the corners are not-present (broken). Therefore, if a border is broken, diagonals are generated.\n\n**Final Algorithm and Implementation**\n\n1.  **Detect Objects:** Identify inner color and border, then the 8-connected component to see inner shape\n2.  **For each object**, Check all 8 neighbors (orthogonals and diagonals). Identify shell pixels from inner pixel.\n3.  **Missing border (value != border color) generates beams** :\n    -   Shoot beam of \"inner color\" extending in the empty direction, from the empty shell pixel.\n    -   A missing corner creates a beam at 45 degrees.\n4.  **At Beams and intersections**, no occlusion occurs, just drawing. If beams overlap, the rule is to simply plot all.\n\n**Test Input Analysis and Construction**\nI will create the output for the test grid. This is just applying the rules. I will be very careful to generate beams. I'll start with the base, and then plot the coordinates. I'll finish this carefully and then produce the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify objects defined by a border color (usually 3, green) enclosing an inner color. The transformation involves projecting \"beams\" of the inner color outwards from the object. The direction of these beams is determined by gaps or \"missing pieces\" in the border of the object in the input grid.\n\n**Rules derived from examples:**\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find rectangular blocks of an inner color surrounded by a border (typically color 3).\n2.  **Check Neighbors:** For each cell of the inner block, check its neighbors in the \"border shell\" (Up, Down, Left, Right, and the 4 Diagonals).\n3.  **Project Beams:**\n    *   If an orthogonal neighbor (Up, Down, Left, Right) in the border shell is **missing** (i.e., it is the background color 8 instead of the border color), project a beam of the inner color in that direction (Vertical or Horizontal).\n    *   If a diagonal neighbor (Corner) in the border shell is **missing**, project a diagonal beam of the inner color outwards from that corner.\n4.  **Beam Propagation:** Beams travel in a straight line until the edge of the grid, overwriting the background.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n**Object 1 (Red/2):** Inner block at Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5.\n*   **Missing Top** at (4,4): Beam **UP** (Color 2) at Col 4.\n*   **Missing Top-Right Corner** at (4,6): Beam **UP-RIGHT** (Color 2) starting at (4,6).\n*   **Missing Left** at (5,3): Beam **LEFT** (Color 2) at Row 5.\n*   **Missing Bottom-Right Corner** at (7,6): Beam **DOWN-RIGHT** (Color 2) starting at (7,6).\n\n**Object 2 (Yellow/4):** Inner block at Rows 5-6, Cols 15-16.\n*   **Missing Top-Right Corner** at (4,17): Beam **UP-RIGHT** (Color 4) starting at (4,17).\n*   **Missing Right** at (5,17): Beam **RIGHT** (Color 4) at Row 5.\n*   **Missing Bottom** at (7,15): Beam **DOWN** (Color 4) at Col 15.\n\n**Object 3 (Magenta/6):** Inner block at Rows 14-15, Cols 23-24.\n*   **Missing Top** at (13,23): Beam **UP** (Color 6) at Col 23.\n*   **Missing Top-Right Corner** at (13,25): Beam **UP-RIGHT** (Color 6) starting at (13,25).\n*   **Missing Bottom-Right Corner** at (16,25): Beam **DOWN-RIGHT** (Color 6) starting at (16,25).\n\n**Object 4 (Orange/7):** Inner block at Rows 20-21, Cols 22-23.\n*   **Missing Right** at (20,24): Beam **RIGHT** (Color 7) at Row 20.\n*   **Missing Bottom-Right Corner** at (22,24): Beam **DOWN-RIGHT** (Color 7) starting at (22,24).\n\n**Object 5 (Maroon/9):** Inner block at Rows 25-26, Cols 1-2.\n*   **Missing Top** at (24,2): Beam **UP** (Color 9) at Col 2.\n*   **Missing Bottom-Right Corner** at (27,3): Beam **DOWN-RIGHT** (Color 9) starting at (27,3).\n\nI will now generate the output grid by applying these beams to the input grid.\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,2,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

The borders have \"gaps\" where 8 appears instead of 3\n3. From each gap, a line extends outward:\n   - Edge gaps: lines extend perpendicular to the edge (horizontal or vertical)\n   - Corner gaps: lines extend diagonally\n4. When lines from different shapes would collide, they run parallel instead of crossing\n\nFor the test input, I identified these shapes and their gaps:\n- Shape 1 (2s): gaps at (4,4)-up, (5,3)-left, (7,6)-diagonal down-right\n- Shape 2 (4s): gaps at (4,14)-diagonal up-left, (5,17)-right, (7,15)-down\n- Shape 3 (6s): gaps at (13,23)-up, (13,25)-diagonal up-right, (16,25)-diagonal down-right\n- Shape 4 (7s): gaps at (20,24)-right, (22,24)-diagonal down-right\n- Shape 5 (9s): gaps at (24,2)-up, (27,3)-diagonal down-right\n\nThe lines extend from these gaps, with shape 1's diagonal becoming parallel to shape 2's vertical when they meet.\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

Look at the **perimeter cells** of that bounding box. Any perimeter cell that is still **background (8)** is an **opening (a \u201cgap\u201d)** in the frame.\n3. Each gap emits a **ray** of the interior color:\n   - If the gap is on the **top edge**, the ray goes **up**.\n   - **Bottom edge** \u2192 **down**.\n   - **Left edge** \u2192 **left**.\n   - **Right edge** \u2192 **right**.\n   - If the gap is at a **corner**, the ray goes **diagonally outward** from that corner.\n4. The ray **colors the gap cell itself** and then continues cell-by-cell in its direction, **coloring only background (8)** cells, stopping when it would leave the grid or hit a cell that was **already non-background in the original input** (frames/interiors act as blockers).\n5. If two rays claim the same background cell, the cell takes the color of the ray whose **gap is closest (fewest steps along that ray)**; ties are broken by the gap that appears first in reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n\nApplying that to the test input yields the following output grid.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

When two rays would paint the same background cell, the practical way to match the behavior is:\n   - **Never overwrite a non-8 already painted cell** (so earlier rays keep their color).  \n   (This only matters when rays overlap; most training examples don\u2019t overlap, but the test does.)\n\nThis exactly explains the added straight lines/diagonals in the examples: rays only emerge where a core pixel has a neighboring 8 (a \u201cgap\u201d in the 3-frame), and they travel in that direction until blocked.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid for the test input\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,9,8,8,8  \n8,2,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,9,8,8,8,8  \n2,8,2,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,2,9,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,9,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,4,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,9,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,7  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,7,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,7,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6  \n8,4,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n4,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",
