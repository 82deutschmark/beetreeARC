The task is to take a set of shapes in an input grid, and somehow translate that into a new, differently sized, grid. It's not a straightforward scaling or copying, there's some kind of logic at play. I've analyzed two example cases to uncover the pattern. It seems there is a core algorithm that involves the following steps:\n1.  **Identify 4 Main Shapes** In a complex grid, there's usually a central region containing a code. Identify this region's shape and assign it as Shape A. Find the other three distinct shapes. These are your shape pool, A, B, C, and D.\n2.  **Locate the Hidden Code** Inside that central region, there is a coded structure of pixels. This code has important details. The inner pixels within this primary shape serve as a mapping key.\n3.  **Determine Output Grid Structure** Analyze input/output size ratios in given examples.\n4.  **Map Shapes to Output Quadrants** Arrange your Shapes A, B, C and D across your new grid. The arrangement has rules, discovered in Ex 1 and Ex 2. The code in the primary shape maps to relative positions on the new grid. Specifically, it seems to encode a \"quadrant\" mapping.\n5.  **Assign Colors** Assign the colors, from each shapes to locations in your new output. The code's colors specify the color mapping between regions on the input and output grids.\n6.  **Shape Assembly** In the output grid, the new shapes are tiled together. The shapes are assembled and adjusted to create the new overall output.\n7.  **Shape Z-Indexing** Resolve conflicts when shapes overlap in certain locations.\n\nIn the Test input, the key challenge lies in the overlap. It seems shapes are cropped, merged, or z-indexed to make the resulting shape. I will assume a Z-index on code values such that, in an overlap, the shape with higher code gets priority. So, let's assemble the test based on these points.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we transform a 26x26 input grid into an output grid based on patterns inferred from two examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid contains four distinct colored shapes (connected components of non-zero integers).\n    *   In the Test Input, these are:\n        *   **Maroon (9)**: A large shape in the Top-Left.\n        *   **Grey (5)**: A large shape in the Top-Right.\n        *   **Orange (7)**: A smaller shape in the Bottom-Left.\n        *   **Red (2)**: A smaller shape in the Bottom-Right.\n\n2.  **The \"Code\":** One of the shapes contains a 2x2 pattern of \"intruder\" pixels (colors different from the shape's main color). This 2x2 pattern acts as a key for the output.\n    *   In Example 1, the Top-Left Red shape contained: `1 5` on the top row and `8 9` on the bottom row.\n    *   In Example 2, the Top-Left (relative) Magenta shape contained: `2 4` / `8 3`.\n    *   In the **Test Input**, the Maroon (9) shape contains the code. Looking at rows 5-6 (global) and cols 4-5 (relative to the shape's interior):\n        *   Row 5: `... 9, 3, 6, 9 ...` -> Top row of code is **3, 6**.\n        *   Row 6: `... 9, 4, 8, 9 ...` -> Bottom row of code is **4, 8**.\n    *   The Code is:\n        ```\n        3 6\n        4 8\n        ```\n    *   This Code defines the color and relative position of the four shapes in the output grid:\n        *   **Top-Left (TL): Color 3 (Green)**\n        *   **Top-Right (TR): Color 6 (Magenta)**\n        *   **Bottom-Left (BL): Color 4 (Yellow)**\n        *   **Bottom-Right (BR): Color 8 (Teal)**\n\n3.  **Mapping Shapes to Quadrants:** We need to determine which input shape maps to which output quadrant.\n    *   In Example 1:\n        *   Input TL (Red) -> Output TL (Color 1).\n        *   Input TR (Orange) -> Output TR (Color 5).\n        *   Input BR (Green) -> Output BL (Color 8).\n        *   Input BL (Yellow) -> Output BR (Color 9).\n    *   In Example 2:\n        *   Input TL (Magenta) -> Output TL (Color 2).\n        *   Input TR (Grey) -> Output BL (Color 8).\n        *   Input BL (Maroon) -> Output BR (Color 3).\n        *   Input BR (Blue) -> Output TR (Color 4).\n    *   Comparing the Test Input to the examples, we follow the pattern of assembling the puzzle. The shapes are tessellated to form a complete rectangle.\n    *   Based on shape sizes and dimensions in the Test Input (Maroon ~10x8, Grey ~10x12, Red ~6x4, Orange ~3x6), and assuming a **13x13** output grid (fitting the width 10+3=13 and height 8+? or 12+?), we map:\n        *   **Output TL (Color 3)** corresponds to the **Maroon (TL)** input shape.\n        *   **Output TR (Color 6)** corresponds to the **Red (BR)** input shape.\n        *   **Output BL (Color 4)** corresponds to the **Grey (TR)** input shape.\n        *   **Output BR (Color 8)** corresponds to the **Orange (BL)** input shape.\n    *   This involves moving the input shapes to their respective corners in the output grid:\n        *   Maroon (Color 9 in input) becomes **Color 3** at (0,0).\n        *   Red (Color 2 in input) becomes **Color 6** at Top-Right.\n        *   Grey (Color 5 in input) becomes **Color 4** at Bottom-Left.\n        *   Orange (Color 7 in input) becomes **Color 8** at Bottom-Right.\n\n4.  **Construction:**\n    *   The output grid size is determined to be **13x13** to accommodate the shapes.\n    *   **Layer 1 (TL, Color 3):** The Maroon shape is placed at (0,0).\n    *   **Layer 2 (TR, Color 6):** The Red shape is placed at the top-right corner.\n    *   **Layer 3 (BL, Color 4):** The Grey shape is placed at the bottom-left corner.\n    *   **Layer 4 (BR, Color 8):** The Orange shape is placed at the bottom-right corner.\n    *   Overlaps are resolved by priority (Later shapes overwrite earlier ones, or strictly tessellated). Given the tight fit, the shapes essentially tile the grid.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n\n*   **TL (Maroon -> 3):** A large block occupying the top-left.\n*   **TR (Red -> 6):** A triangle wedge in the top-right.\n*   **BL (Grey -> 4):** A large block occupying the bottom-left.\n*   **BR (Orange -> 8):** A strip in the bottom-right.\n\n**Step-by-step Grid Fill (13x13):**\n*   **Row 0:** Maroon (width 10) `3333333333` + Red (width 3, top of triangle) `666`. Total `3333333333666`.\n*   **Row 1:** Maroon (width 10) `3333333333` + Red (width 4) `6666`. Overlap at col 9? Assuming Red is Top-Right aligned, it occupies cols 9-12. Maroon occupies 0-9. `3333333336666`.\n*   ... (Continuing for all rows, handling the specific shape geometries).\n    *   Maroon shape is 10 wide, 8 high.\n    *   Red shape is 6 wide, 4 high.\n    *   Grey shape is 10 wide, 12 high.\n    *   Orange shape is 3 wide, 6 high.\n\nWait, Grey (height 12) at BL + Maroon (height 8) at TL = 20 height? This implies significant overlap or a larger grid. However, checking widths: Maroon (10) + Orange (3) = 13. Grey (10) + Red (6) = 16 (too wide).\nActually, the Grey shape maps to **TR** in Ex 2's logic? No, Grey was TR in Input, mapped to BL in Output.\nLet's stick to the visual puzzle assembly.\n*   Top Left: Maroon (3).\n*   Top Right: Red (6).\n*   Bottom Left: Grey (4).\n*   Bottom Right: Orange (8).\n\nFinal check on pixel values for row 0 of output:\nMaroon (row 0): `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3`.\nRed (row 0): `2,2,2` -> `6,6,6`.\nCombined: `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6`.\n\nCompleted Output Grid:\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 0>\n<CANDIDATE 1>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 32x22\n3333333333000000066666\n3333333000000000666666\n3300000033000000666666\n3333000033000006666666\n3333333333000006666666\n3333333333000066666666\n3333333333000666666666\n3333333333000666666666\n0000000000000666600000\n0000000000000666000000\n4444000000888888000000\n4444400000888888000000\n4444440000888888000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n3333333333000000066666\n3333333000000000666666\n3300000033000000666666\n3333000033000006666666\n3333333333000006666666\n3333333333000066666666\n3333333333000666666666\n3333333333000666666666\n0000000000000666600000\n0000000000000666000000\n4444000000888888000000\n4444400000888888000000\n4444440000888888000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_2_step_1\">\nOkay, let's see. The task is to analyze these ARC problem examples and then figure out a solution. I see two examples and a test input. The goal is to produce an output grid from an input grid, based on some rules.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Hypotheses:**\n\nIt looks like the output is derived from some smaller pieces of the input grid. I'm seeing shapes and colors. My initial hypothesis is that there are 4 main regions to consider: Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, and Bottom-Right, both in the input and output. The output grid seems to be formed by combining or modifying the information in those regions, based on a key element.\n\nThe key seems to be located in the top-left section of the input, in a container of one color, and containing a small grid of *noise* of another four colors. The colors of the other three shapes and the *noise* in the container are the source of the information. The output grid looks to have those four noise colors in their respective quadrants, so I'm thinking the noise dictates the final colors.\n\n**Shape Analysis and Mapping:**\n\nI'm now looking at the shape and trying to identify if the output is just a scaled/transformed version of an input shape. Not quite! Shapes appear to be transformed, but pixel counts often don't match. Rotations are important, and it seems like the key is related to the transformations. The sizes of the output blocks are the key. If the shape is too large, the output is larger, but if it is smaller, it's also a part of the output.\n\nIn the first example, the color of the output is determined by the \"noise\", and the color arrangement is determined by position in the output: The colors are arranged similarly in quadrants, following the arrangement of the \"noise\" inside the key. This is a very interesting concept.\n\nSo I'm thinking, in each quadrant, the input region determines the shape of that region in the output. But the color of that region is determined by the \"noise\", specifically from the small grid within the frame. The rotation, resizing, and layering of the pieces are crucial. And it looks like the 9 is also a color from a corner.\n\n**Identifying the Transformation Logic:**\n\nWhat does the mapping/transformation look like? Maybe a 90-degree clockwise rotation, since the shapes seem to be arranged in quadrants? Okay, so all the shapes should be rotated 90 deg clockwise. The pixel counts help me narrow it down. The small triangle shape seems to be unchanged. In Example 2, something similar happens. One shape does a 180 and swaps.\n\nAfter closer look, it's a mix of a rotation and a swap. In Example 2, some shapes are rotated by 180 degrees and swapped. In Example 1, something similar happened, a swap by swapping positions in the output. The shapes don't rotate to match, but rather the color of the shape matches.\n\n**Test Input Approach:**\n\nSo for the test input, I will:\n\n1.  Isolate the 4 shapes\n2.  Extract the Key (noise pixels) and their position.\n3.  Perform rotations, and apply these.\n4.  Fit the rotated (or un-rotated) shapes into the correct quadrants.\n\nThe key has a frame like structure. If it follows the Ex 1 logic, one quadrant is kept unchanged, with others rotated. Let's start building up the grid now. It looks like the S_TL (the Key shape in the upper left corner) is defining my new output size. I think that's it. Let's do this!\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the test input grid based on the rules inferred from two examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid always contains four distinct clusters of colored pixels (shapes) located roughly in the four quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n2.  **The Key:** One of the shapes (always the Top-Left one in the examples and test input) acts as a \"container\" for a 2x2 key. This key consists of four pixels of different colors near the center of the container shape.\n    *   The 2x2 key layout corresponds to the four quadrants of the output grid.\n    *   Key(0,0) -> Color for Output Top-Left.\n    *   Key(0,1) -> Color for Output Top-Right.\n    *   Key(1,0) -> Color for Output Bottom-Left.\n    *   Key(1,1) -> Color for Output Bottom-Right.\n3.  **Mapping Rules:**\n    *   **Colors:** The output quadrants take the colors specified by the key.\n    *   **Shapes:** The shapes from the input quadrants are mapped to the output quadrants.\n        *   **Top-Left (TL):** The input TL shape is mapped to the output TL quadrant. It is **not rotated**.\n        *   **Top-Right (TR):** The input TR shape is mapped to the output TR quadrant. It is **rotated 90 degrees clockwise**.\n        *   **Bottom-Left (BL) and Bottom-Right (BR):** These two swap positions.\n            *   The input **Bottom-Right** shape is mapped to the output **Bottom-Left** quadrant. It is **rotated 90 degrees clockwise**.\n            *   The input **Bottom-Left** shape is mapped to the output **Bottom-Right** quadrant. It is **rotated 90 degrees clockwise**.\n4.  **Grid Construction:** The output grid is assembled by placing these transformed shapes into their respective corners. The total width is the sum of the widths of the left and right components. The total height is the sum of the heights of the top and bottom components.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key and Colors:**\n    *   The TL container (Color 9) has the key:\n        ```\n        3 6\n        4 8\n        ```\n    *   **Output TL Color:** 3\n    *   **Output TR Color:** 6\n    *   **Output BL Color:** 4\n    *   **Output BR Color:** 8\n\n2.  **Extract and Measure Input Shapes:**\n    *   **S_TL (Top-Left, Color 9):**\n        *   Shape includes the frame of 9s.\n        *   Dimensions: 10 pixels wide x 8 pixels high.\n    *   **S_TR (Top-Right, Color 5):**\n        *   Dimensions: 10 pixels wide x 12 pixels high.\n    *   **S_BL (Bottom-Left, Color 7):**\n        *   Dimensions: 3 pixels wide x 6 pixels high.\n    *   **S_BR (Bottom-Right, Color 2):**\n        *   Dimensions: 6 pixels wide x 4 pixels high.\n\n3.  **Transform Shapes:**\n    *   **T_TL (Output TL):** Source S_TL (9). **No Rotation**. Color becomes 3.\n        *   Size: 10x8.\n    *   **T_TR (Output TR):** Source S_TR (5). **Rotate 90 CW**. Color becomes 6.\n        *   Original 10x12 -> Rotated 12x10.\n        *   Size: 12x10.\n    *   **T_BL (Output BL):** Source S_BR (2). **Rotate 90 CW**. Color becomes 4.\n        *   Original 6x4 -> Rotated 4x6.\n        *   Size: 4x6.\n    *   **T_BR (Output BR):** Source S_BL (7). **Rotate 90 CW**. Color becomes 8.\n        *   Original 3x6 -> Rotated 6x3.\n        *   Size: 6x3.\n\n4.  **Assemble Output Grid:**\n    *   **Width:** Max(Width(T_TL), Width(T_BL)) + Max(Width(T_TR), Width(T_BR))\n        *   Left Column Width: Max(10, 4) = 10.\n        *   Right Column Width: Max(12, 6) = 12.\n        *   Total Width: 10 + 12 = 22.\n    *   **Height:** Max(Height(T_TL), Height(T_TR)) + Max(Height(T_BL), Height(T_BR))\n        *   Top Row Height: Max(8, 10) = 10.\n        *   Bottom Row Height: Max(6, 3) = 6.\n        *   Total Height: 10 + 6 = 16.\n    *   **Placement:**\n        *   T_TL placed at (0, 0).\n        *   T_TR placed at (0, 10) [Row 0, Col 10].\n        *   T_BL placed at (10, 0) [Row 10, Col 0].\n        *   T_BR placed at (10, 10) [Row 10, Col 10].\n\n**Constructing the Grid:**\n*   **T_TL (3s):** Copy the shape of 9s from input, replace with 3.\n*   **T_TR (6s):** Rotate the shape of 5s from input 90\u00b0 CW, replace with 6.\n*   **T_BL (4s):** Rotate the shape of 2s from input 90\u00b0 CW, replace with 4.\n*   **T_BR (8s):** Rotate the shape of 7s from input 90\u00b0 CW, replace with 8.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 1>\n<CANDIDATE 2>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 12x12\n333333333366\n333333333366\n333388883366\n333388883366\n338888888866\n338888888866\n333333388888\n333333388888\n444444444888\n444444444888\n444444444488\n444444444448\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\nLooking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation from the examples:\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.

The user wants me to translate an input grid into an output grid based on a few examples, and I think I've cracked it.**\n\nEssentially, it's about identifying \"anchor\" shapes and using a \"key\" inside one of them to map their relative positions to colors in the output. The input is a 20x20 grid, and the key is a 2x2 colored region contained within one of the larger shapes. The spatial arrangement of four distinct shapes (excluding the black background) is the key; a Top-Left shape might house this region, and others follow.\n\nThe \"key\" is critical because the values it contains determine the colors in the output grid. The algorithm determines the positions of the Shapes relative to each other. For example: if Top-Left of key is color 1 and that key is inside a red shape, any shape positioned Top-Left in the input gets the \"1\" color in the output.\n\nAnalyzing the examples, the outputs represent a downsampled and colored version of the spatial layout of shapes. The output size (8x8 or 10x10) appears related to the input size somehow. It seems to be a 2x2 sample of the input and the colors of the resulting downsampled shapes are assigned based on the key.\n\nThe specific examples show that there are four colored regions, and the output is colored based on the colors found in the hole of the larger shape.\n\nIn the first example, the inner part of a red frame contains the colors 1,5,8,9, and the frame is Top-Left in the input grid. This becomes the basis for the colors of large sections in the 8x8 output. The shapes act as territories or anchors. The position is critical.\n\nThe second example confirms the same logic: The relative spatial positions of other shapes is mapped to the inner-color-values of a selected key shape.\n\nTherefore the logic:\n\n1.  Identify the 4 distinct non-black shapes and their relative position. These are your spatial anchors (Top-Left, Top-Right, etc.).\n2.  Find the \"Key\". Locate a 2x2 block of colors within *one* of the larger shapes and record their TL, TR, BL, BR values.\n3.  Based on Key values, determine mapping. The values inside the Key are your target output colors. Each position within the key maps to a corresponding spatial region.\n\nThe crucial detail: Output size seems a downsampled version of the input, possibly by a factor of 2 (or based on active grid size + Padding / 2). The background (black) is replaced with the color of the \"nearest\" shape. A Voronoi diagram of the input's layout.\nI think the output size is the input's active grid dimensions divided by 2.\n\nIn the given test case, I'll generate the output based on this. Let's see how it goes.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we need to understand the relationship between the shapes in the input grid and the colored regions in the output grid.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the \"Key\" and Shape Mapping\nIn both solved examples, there are four large colored shapes positioned roughly in the four quadrants of the grid (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). One of these shapes contains a \"Key\" \u2014 a 2x2 block of distinct colors inside its hollow interior.\n\n*   **Example 1**:\n    *   **Input Shapes**: Red (Top-Left), Orange (Top-Right), Yellow (Bottom-Left), Green (Bottom-Right).\n    *   **Key**: Found inside the Red shape. The 2x2 pixels are:\n        *   Top-Left: 1 (Blue)\n        *   Top-Right: 5 (Grey)\n        *   Bottom-Left: 8 (Teal)\n        *   Bottom-Right: 9 (Maroon)\n    *   **Output**: The grid is divided into regions corresponding to the input shapes.\n        *   The Red shape (Top-Left) area becomes Color 1.\n        *   The Orange shape (Top-Right) area becomes Color 5.\n        *   The Yellow shape (Bottom-Left) area becomes Color 8.\n        *   The Green shape (Bottom-Right) area becomes Color 9.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The Key maps the spatial position of the shapes to the target colors. Specifically, $Key_{Position} \\rightarrow Color_{Target}$.\n\n*   **Example 2**:\n    *   **Input Shapes**: Magenta (Top-Left region), Grey (Top-Right region), Maroon (Bottom-Left region), Blue (Bottom-Right region).\n    *   **Key**: Found inside the Magenta shape.\n        *   Top-Left: 2 (Red)\n        *   Top-Right: 4 (Yellow)\n        *   Bottom-Left: 8 (Teal)\n        *   Bottom-Right: 3 (Green)\n    *   **Output**:\n        *   Top-Left region (Magenta area) -> 2.\n        *   Top-Right region (Grey area) -> 4.\n        *   Bottom-Left region (Maroon area) -> 8.\n        *   Bottom-Right region (Blue area) -> 3.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Output Dimensions and Geometry\nThe output grid appears to be a downsampled \"map\" of the input grid.\n*   **Example 1**: Input 20x20 $\\rightarrow$ Output 8x8. (Scale factor 2.5).\n*   **Example 2**: Input 20x20 $\\rightarrow$ Output 10x10. (Scale factor 2).\n*   **Test Input**: Input 26x26.\n    *   Using a scale factor of 2 (consistent with Example 2 and integer division), the output should be **13x13**.\n\nThe filling logic resembles a Voronoi diagram or Nearest Neighbor scaling: each pixel in the output grid corresponds to a coordinate in the input grid. The color is determined by the closest input \"Shape\" centroid, using the mapping derived from the Key.\n\n### Step 3: Apply to Test Input\n1.  **Identify Shapes**:\n    *   **Top-Left**: Maroon (9) shape.\n    *   **Top-Right**: Grey (5) shape.\n    *   **Bottom-Left**: Orange (7) shape.\n    *   **Bottom-Right**: Red (2) shape.\n\n2.  **Read the Key**:\n    *   The Key is inside the Maroon (9) shape (rows 5-6, cols 4-5 roughly).\n    *   Row 5 inside hole: `3, 6`\n    *   Row 6 inside hole: `4, 8`\n    *   **Mapping**:\n        *   **TL** (Maroon region) $\\rightarrow$ **3** (Green)\n        *   **TR** (Grey region) $\\rightarrow$ **6** (Magenta)\n        *   **BL** (Orange region) $\\rightarrow$ **4** (Yellow)\n        *   **BR** (Red region) $\\rightarrow$ **8** (Teal)\n\n3.  **Estimate Centroids**:\n    Based on the input grid provided:\n    *   **TL (Maroon)**: Center approx (7.5, 7.5).\n    *   **TR (Grey)**: Center approx (13, 21).\n    *   **BL (Orange)**: Center approx (21, 5).\n    *   **BR (Red)**: Center approx (21.5, 20).\n\n4.  **Construct Output Grid (13x13)**:\n    We sample the input space. For an output cell $(r, c)$, the corresponding input coordinate is roughly $(2r+1, 2c+1)$. We assign the color of the nearest centroid.\n\n    *   **Row 0** (Input $y \\approx 1$):\n        *   Closer to TL(3) on the left, TR(6) on the right.\n        *   Boundary calc: $x \\approx 18$ (Input col). Output col $c \\approx 8.5$.\n        *   Result: 9 cells of **3**, 4 cells of **6**.\n    *   **Row 12** (Input $y \\approx 25$):\n        *   Closer to BL(4) on the left, BR(8) on the right.\n        *   Boundary calc: $x \\approx 12.5$ (Input col). Output col $c \\approx 5.75$.\n        *   Result: 6 cells of **4**, 7 cells of **8**.\n    *   **Vertical Transitions**:\n        *   Left side (Col 0): Transition from 3 to 4 around Row 6/7.\n        *   Right side (Col 12): Transition from 6 to 8 around Row 8/9.\n\n    By interpolating these boundaries, we construct the grid.\n\n    *   **Rows 0-5**: The boundary between 3 and 6 is around col 8/9.\n    *   **Rows 6-7**: Transition rows where 3 becomes 4 on the left.\n    *   **Rows 8-12**: The boundary between 4 and 8 is around col 5/6.\n\n    Simulated Grid Rows:\n    *   R0-R2: `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6`\n    *   R3-R5: Boundary shifts slightly left as we go down and Grey gets closer. `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6`\n    *   R6-R7: Left side becomes 4. Right side stays 6 then becomes 8.\n    *   R8-R12: Bottom half. `4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\n    Precise calculation yields the final grid below.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 5>\n<CANDIDATE 6>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 20x15\n333333333666888\n333333333666688\n3333888833666668\n333333333666666\n333333333666688\n3333888833666688\n3388888833666666\n333333333666666\n444888888888888\n444888888888888\n444888888888888\n488888888888888\n488888888888888\n488888888888888\n888888888888888\n888888888888888\n888888888888888\n888888888888888\n888888888888888\n888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_3\">\n**Initial Assessment & Hypothesis Formation**\n\nMy initial task involves creating a program that takes two examples and a test input and processes an ARC-based grid-based problem. I must analyze two examples. From those, I hypothesize there's a specific pattern: it involves extracting shapes from a grid and re-coloring them based on some coded relationship. There's a 20x20 input and an 8x8 output. There are shapes colored as red (2), orange (7), yellow (4), and green (3). I realized there are four distinct shapes in four quadrants of a 20x20 input grid. The shapes are \"containers\" holding information - internal pixels which are the real information to extract from the input.\n\n**Deconstructing the Example**\n\nMy mind is now diving into the details. I see in example 1 an 8x8 output. I can see the shapes: A red square with some internal pixel info (1,5,8,9) in it. I have to look into this info carefully.\nI focus on the \"noise\" or \"inner pixels\" of these shapes. The key insight is that the output grid seems to be structured according to these inner pixels of one \"key\" shape. For example, the top-left quadrant of the output is filled with ones and nines. Could this be?\nLooking at it again, 1, 5, 8, and 9 are the inner pixels in the red shape! And, these numbers are also the colors assigned to the four quadrants of the output. The top-left 4x4 area of the 8x8 grid contains ones and nines, the top-right 4x4 has fives, the bottom left has eights and nines, and the bottom right has nines.\n\n**Building the Logic**\n\nThis is starting to make sense: The internal numbers in the red \"key\" shape (1, 5, 8, 9) define the colors that should fill the four quadrants in the output. I am sure that this mapping determines how the colors are assigned. I suspect the task is to extract the 4 shapes, color them according to the legend found inside one of them, and combine them into the output. I also realized that the output grid's size equals the sum of its quadrant sizes. For example, example 2, 10x10. I noticed that 5+5=10. This is very important.\n\n**Generalizing the Approach**\n\nNow I have a generalized strategy:\n1.  Identify the four main objects in the input.\n2.  Find the \"key\" object (the one with the coded \"inner pixels\").\n3.  The color code maps to locations of the shapes in the 2x2 grid.\n4.  Draw each shape with the colors according to the code on the output canvas.\n\nI begin to test it with a test input. It looks like the same approach works.\n\n**Finalizing and Implementing**\n\nNow I have a solid approach to the problem:\n1.  Read the input.\n2.  Extract the four shape's boundaries, colors and coordinates.\n3.  Find the shape with the color key.\n4.  Get shape layout.\n5.  Generate the output grid.\n   The output structure will be made from:\n   *   Width=Width(TL) + Width(BR)\n   *   Height=Height(TL) + Height(TR)\n\nThis is what I will implement. This approach should work based on my analysis of the pattern.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on a pattern inferred from two examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Identification of Shapes:** The input grid contains four distinct colored objects, one in each quadrant (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n2.  **The \"Key\" Shape:** One of these shapes contains a 2x2 block of pixels with different colors inside it (a \"code\").\n    *   In Example 1, the Red shape (TL) contains `1, 5, 8, 9`.\n    *   In Example 2, the Green shape (TL) contains `2, 4, 8, 3` (inferred from position).\n    *   In the Test Input, the Maroon shape (TL) contains `3, 6, 4, 8`.\n3.  **Code Mapping:** The 2x2 code maps the four positions (TL, TR, BL, BR) to four specific colors.\n    *   Top-Left pixel of code -> Color for TL shape.\n    *   Top-Right pixel of code -> Color for TR shape.\n    *   Bottom-Left pixel of code -> Color for BL shape.\n    *   Bottom-Right pixel of code -> Color for BR shape.\n    *   **Test Input Mapping:**\n        *   TL (Maroon) -> **3** (Green)\n        *   TR (Grey) -> **6** (Magenta)\n        *   BL (Orange) -> **4** (Yellow)\n        *   BR (Red) -> **8** (Teal)\n4.  **Output Dimensions:**\n    *   The output width is the sum of the widths of the Top-Left shape and the Bottom-Right shape: $W = W_{TL} + W_{BR}$.\n    *   The output height is the sum of the heights of the Top-Left shape and the Top-Right shape: $H = H_{TL} + H_{TR}$.\n    *   Test Input Dimensions:\n        *   TL (Maroon): $9 \\times 8$\n        *   TR (Grey): $10 \\times 12$\n        *   BL (Orange): $3 \\times 6$\n        *   BR (Red): $6 \\times 4$\n        *   Output Width = $9 + 6 = 15$.\n        *   Output Height = $8 + 12 = 20$.\n5.  **Output Construction:**\n    *   The output is filled with a background color corresponding to the **Bottom-Right** mapped color (Color 8).\n    *   The grid is divided into zones based on the Top-Left shape's dimensions ($W_{TL}, H_{TL}$):\n        *   **TL Zone:** $(0,0)$ to $(W_{TL}-1, H_{TL}-1)$. The TL shape is drawn here in its mapped color (3).\n        *   **TR Zone:** $(W_{TL}, 0)$ to $(W-1, H_{TL}-1)$. The TR shape is drawn here in its mapped color (6), clipped if it exceeds the zone dimensions.\n        *   **BL Zone:** $(0, H_{TL})$ to $(W_{TL}-1, H-1)$. The BL shape is drawn here in its mapped color (4), clipped if necessary.\n        *   **BR Zone:** $(W_{TL}, H_{TL})$ to $(W-1, H-1)$. The BR shape is drawn here in its mapped color (8). Since the background is also 8, this shape blends in.\n\n**Step-by-Step Derivation for Test Input:**\n1.  **Canvas:** Create a $15 \\times 20$ grid filled with **8**.\n2.  **TL Shape (Color 3):**\n    *   Place the $9 \\times 8$ Maroon shape mask at $(0,0)$.\n    *   Replace non-zero pixels with **3**.\n3.  **TR Shape (Color 6):**\n    *   Target start: $(9, 0)$.\n    *   Available space: Width $15-9=6$, Height $8$.\n    *   Input TR shape is $10 \\times 12$. Clip to top-left $6 \\times 8$ part.\n    *   Replace non-zero pixels with **6**.\n4.  **BL Shape (Color 4):**\n    *   Target start: $(0, 8)$.\n    *   Available space: Width $9$, Height $20-8=12$.\n    *   Input BL shape is $3 \\times 6$. It fits completely.\n    *   Replace non-zero pixels with **4**.\n5.  **BR Shape (Color 8):**\n    *   Target start: $(9, 8)$.\n    *   Input BR shape is $6 \\times 4$.\n    *   Replace non-zero pixels with **8**. (No visible change against background).\n\n**Completed Output Grid (15x20):**\n*   **Rows 0-7 (Top Band):**\n    *   Cols 0-8: Mask of Maroon Shape (colored 3). Gaps remain 8.\n    *   Cols 9-14: Clipped Mask of Grey Shape (colored 6).\n*   **Rows 8-19 (Bottom Band):**\n    *   Cols 0-8: Mask of Orange Shape (colored 4). Only first 6 rows (8-13) and 3 cols (0-2) have content. Rest is 8.\n    *   Cols 9-14: Mask of Red Shape (colored 8). Visual result is solid 8.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6,8,8\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 6>\n<CANDIDATE 7>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 12x12\n333333336666\n333333336666\n338888336666\n338888336666\n338888338866\n338888338866\n338888338888\n888888838888\n883333338888\n883333338888\n444444888888\n444444888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_3\">\nLooking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1. **Find the 2x2 pattern** embedded within a bordered shape (the \"pattern shape\")\n2. **Identify 4 colored shapes** in the input -

I needed to understand the relationship between input colors and the output's format, which is an 8x8 grid. The input consists of a 20x20 grid with four distinct shapes and the central clue is a small colored block within the top-left shape. The output grid's colors were directly related to that block, but in a rearranged fashion. The 8x8 size made me think of the block sizes to confirm its relationship to the output size.\n\nI proceeded to **Example 2**. The 10x10 size of its output also made me believe that it would have some direct mapping between block sizes and output size. My initial assumptions included geometric operations, like scaling, to the input grid. I confirmed the code-to-color mapping in Example 2 which led me to the idea of splitting the 20x20 input to 4 blocks of 10x10 and looking at each block to deduce their corresponding color. I saw the colored block again, as a central clue.\nI considered a few possibilities: the output grid might be a reduced-resolution version of the input, the output might represent a simplified version of the input shapes, or the output might be based on some combination of these.\n\nNext, I delved into finding the core relationship: it looked like the output grid was a scaled-down representation of the input, but the colors were derived from the *code* within the container. I began to formalize the steps: **find the container**, **extract the code**, **map the colors**. This suggested an approach based on segmentation or division into regions.\n\nI had to look into the method of transforming input shape sizes to the output sizes, and I was focusing on scaling. I examined if there was any obvious connection between the Input shapes and Output. I noticed the key was definitely the 'code' 2x2 colored block.\n\nThe core hypothesis crystallized: the output grid is a Voronoi diagram of the corners, but with the boundaries modulated by the original empty space to get the grid partitions. The idea of the output size became clear: Half the dimensions of the input shape.\n\nI took the test input and applied the approach: output size is half, find the code, determine the regions, and assign the colors. The color mapping was always related to the 2x2 color key in the container (top-left). I performed checks for scaling, gaps, and partition.\n\nFinally, the answer comes down to code-extraction and partitioning based on empty space to give the output grid. I am confident in my response.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform an input grid into an output grid based on a pattern inferred from two examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Structure:** The input grids contain four distinct colored shapes arranged roughly in the four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). The background is black (0).\n2.  **The Code:** In both examples, exactly one of the four shapes acts as a \"container\" or \"key\". This shape is not uniform; it contains a distinct 2x2 square of pixels with four different colors.\n    *   **Example 1:** The Top-Left Red (2) shape contains a 2x2 block: `1, 5` (top row), `8, 9` (bottom row).\n    *   **Example 2:** The Top-Left Magenta (6) shape contains a 2x2 block: `2, 4` (top row), `8, 3` (bottom row).\n3.  **The Output Mapping:** The output grid is a visualization of the layout of the four input shapes, but the regions are colored according to the \"Code\" found in the key shape.\n    *   The region corresponding to the Top-Left quadrant takes the Top-Left color from the code.\n    *   The region corresponding to the Top-Right quadrant takes the Top-Right color from the code.\n    *   And so on for Bottom-Left and Bottom-Right.\n4.  **Geometry and Scaling:**\n    *   The output grid represents a condensed version of the input grid. It removes the empty black space between the shapes and scales the result.\n    *   **Example 1:** Input 20x20 -> Output 8x8. (Scale factor ~0.4 or Input/2.5). The boundaries are jagged, reflecting the irregular shapes.\n    *   **Example 2:** Input 20x20 -> Output 10x10. (Scale factor 0.5). The boundaries are straight lines, reflecting the blocky/rectangular shapes.\n    *   The split lines in the output grid correspond to the relative sizes of the shape clusters in the input.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Input Grid:**\n    *   Size: 26x26.\n    *   **Shapes:**\n        *   **Top-Left:** Maroon (9) shape. This shape contains the **Code**.\n        *   **Top-Right:** Grey (5) shape. Large block.\n        *   **Bottom-Left:** Orange (7) shape. Rectangle.\n        *   **Bottom-Right:** Red (2) shape. Rectangle.\n2.  **Extract the Code:**\n    *   Locate the non-Maroon pixels inside the Top-Left Maroon shape (Rows 6-7, Cols 4-5).\n    *   Row 6: `...9, 3, 6, 9...` -> Colors are **3 (Green)** and **6 (Magenta)**.\n    *   Row 7: `...9, 4, 8, 9...` -> Colors are **4 (Yellow)** and **8 (Light Blue)**.\n    *   **Code Mapping:**\n        *   Top-Left Region -> **3**\n        *   Top-Right Region -> **6**\n        *   Bottom-Left Region -> **4**\n        *   Bottom-Right Region -> **8**\n3.  **Determine Output Geometry:**\n    *   **Size:** Following the pattern of Example 2 (clean rectangular shapes -> scale by 0.5), the input size 26x26 maps to **13x13**.\n    *   **Partitions:** Determine where to split the 13x13 grid based on the gaps in the input.\n        *   **Horizontal Split (Top vs Bottom):**\n            *   Top shapes end at row 17.

The task involves grids of integers (0-9). My goal is to figure out the transformation rules, test it against the examples, and then apply it to the test case. The user has provided \"Object Descriptions\" and a \"Transformation Description\", hinting at how to approach this problem.\n\nThe provided transformation logic is as follows:\n1.  Identify a composite object with two internal contrasting colors, extract those colors (P00, P01, P10, P11).\n2.  Find four main colored objects in the grid and assign them to quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n3.  Recolor those four objects using the extracted internal colors.\n4.  Use a region growing or \"Voronoi\" algorithm to fill in the zeros, assigning them the color of the nearest object.\n5.  Crop/pad to a square region and downsample (typically by a factor of 2) to get the smaller output.\n\nI'll now need to verify this logic on the examples.\n\n**Verification on Example 1**\n\nIn the Example 1 input (20x20), I find the following:\n*   A \"composite object\" in the top-left area. It is a red shape, with a 2x2 pattern inside. The colors are Blue (1), Gray (5), Teal (8) and Maroon (9).\n*   The quadrant colors are mapped to the four colors as: P00 = Blue (1) at Top-Left, P01 = Gray (5) at Top-Right, P10 = Teal (8) at Bottom-Left, P11 = Maroon (9) at Bottom-Right.\n\nBy recoloring and \"growing\" the output, I see that the output is not 10x10. The output is 8x8. The \"downsampling\" isn't a simple factor 2. Looking at the boundary of the shape, I now think it's cropping a portion of the grid and mapping that to an output that makes sense given the dimensions of the internal blocks. It must be something like \"determine the bounding box of the non-zero cells and then resize to a multiple of 2\".\n\n**Verification on Example 2**\nInput (20x20), Output (10x10)\nI again identify the composite shape, extract its 2x2 internal pattern. P00 = Red (2), P01=Yellow (4), P10=Teal (8), P11=Green (3). I then identify the objects in the quadrants.\nHowever, I can see from this example, the resulting bounding box may not result in a 2x2 scaling. A 18x18 input grid will then pad to a 20x20, and then will translate that to a 10x10 output.\n\n**Processing of Test Input**\nNow I have to look at the new test input (26x26).\n1.  I identify the composite object. It's Maroon (9) at Top-Left, with an internal palette of 3(Green), 6(Magenta), 4(Yellow) and 8(Teal).\n    *   3(Green) is P00 and will map to the TL object\n    *   6(Magenta) is P01 and will map to the TR object\n    *   4(Yellow) is P10 and will map to the BL object\n    *   8(Teal) is P11 and will map to the BR object\n2.  I Identify the objects as:\n    *   TL is Maroon, with the internal palette\n    *   TR is Gray\n    *   BL is Orange\n    *   BR is Red\n3.  I have identified the regions to assign those colors to.\n    *   Maroon (TL), Gray(TR), Orange(BL) and Red (BR)\n4.  I determined the resulting scale and output size.\n    *   If I follow the pattern of padding to a even number, and downscaling by 2, and the objects in the Test Input cover an area, and the grid has a size of 26.\n    *   The total content width is 23 (3 to 25)\n    *   The total content height is 21 (4 to 24)\n    *   If I had to make the grid an even size, I could make it 24 to get a scaling of 12. Since there is already a 2x2\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow the transformation logic derived from the provided examples and the description.\n\n### Analysis of the Request and Examples\n\n1.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   **Identify Composite Object:** Locate the shape containing internal contrasting pixels (the \"palette\").\n    *   **Extract Palette:** Read the 2x2 block of internal pixels $(P_{00}, P_{01}, P_{10}, P_{11})$.\n    *   **Identify Quadrants:** Locate the 4 main solid color masses in the grid (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). One of these is the composite object itself.\n    *   **Assign Colors:** Map the palette colors to the quadrants: $P_{00} \\to TL$, $P_{01} \\to TR$, $P_{10} \\to BL$, $P_{11} \\to BR$.\n    *   **Construct Output:** Create a downsampled grid (factor 2) where the regions corresponding to the quadrants are filled with the assigned colors.

It's all about analyzing the connections between these input grids, and the output we're supposed to create. I'm focusing on trying to figure out the rule that connects the two.\n\nAlright, in Example 1, I see this big grid with all these colored shapes. The key is in this red shape, kinda like a frame, that has these inner pixels of different colors. The output is a smaller grid, and it looks like it's built from colored regions, not just the original shapes. It's not a straight-up mapping, the output is a kind of tiling. This makes me think the \"color map\" is embedded in that red frame. The arrangement of those colors inside the frame determines the arrangement of the regions in the output. The other shapes, the orange, yellow and green, they define the shapes of the output regions. The red shape has 1, 5, 8, and 9 and the colors seem to match. Okay, this \"topology\" comes from the red piece containing the inner pixels and other shapes define the layout.\n\nExample 2 reinforces this. The \"color map\" is inside a pink frame, and the colors are arranged according to the output.\n\nSo, the rule so far is: Look at the small colors that live inside the red/pink frame, the other shapes get assigned colors from that map (in order of position). Those colors and their positions determine the order of outputs and the general arrangement of shapes inside them.\n\nNow, let's look at the Test Input. This is where it gets interesting. I see maroon, grey, orange, and red shapes, and the \"color map\" is inside the maroon shape this time. The tricky part is the \"puzzle\" nature, where the shapes fit together into a rectangle (likely a 12x12).\n\nHere\u2019s my thought process: The output arrangement is related to some property about the input pieces. Is it a ranking? The number of pixels? Size? I have to consider the arrangement of colors in the outputs from previous examples, and how they relate to the size of shapes. The biggest hint is that 8 always relates to smallest. Now, I have to figure out a clear mapping strategy.\n\nIn the Test Input, since the map is embedded in the maroon, I'm ranking and assigning values relative to that. In the test input, I've got my shapes: maroon (with the map), grey, orange, and red.  The final output's structure is determined from the input. I\u2019ve gone through the puzzle elements to make sure that each is considered.\n\nI now need to construct a reasonable final output, that incorporates all the logic I've discovered: The map\u2019s color values tell the output colors. I know the \u201c8\u201d (small value) relates to the smallest area shape, etc. This is the output I constructed with the shapes, in the correct locations based on the principles I've established.\n\nTo solve this task, I analyzed the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grids contain several colored shapes (connected components) on a black background.\n    *   One of these shapes acts as a \"Frame\" or \"Map Holder\". It is distinguished by containing a 2x2 block of different colored pixels inside it.\n    *   The other shapes are solid blocks of color.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Map:** The \"Map\" inside the Frame consists of 4 pixels arranged in a 2x2 square.\n    *   The position of each pixel in the 2x2 map corresponds to a quadrant in the *Output* grid (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n    *   The *color* of the pixel in the map dictates the color of the region in that quadrant of the Output.\n\n3.  **Map Logic & Sorting:**\n    *   I determined which input shape corresponds to which output region by analyzing the pixel counts (area) of the shapes.\n    *   **Rule:** The input shapes (including the Frame shape itself) are ranked by their area (size).\n        *   Rank 1: Smallest area.\n        *   Rank 2: 2nd smallest.\n        *   Rank 3: 3rd smallest.\n        *   Rank 4: Largest area.\n    *   The destination of these pieces is determined by the **Map Values** and their **Positions**:\n        *   The **Map Value 8** always corresponds to the **Smallest Piece (Rank 1)**. The position of '8' in the map tells us which Output Quadrant gets the smallest piece.\n        *   The **Map Position TR (Top-Right)** always receives the **2nd Smallest Piece (Rank 2)**.\n        *   The **Map Holder Shape** (the one containing the map) always goes to the **Output TL (Top-Left)** quadrant. Its rank determines which rank goes to TL (e.g., in the Test Input, the holder is Rank 3).\n        *   The remaining piece goes to the remaining quadrant (Output BL).\n\n4.  **Applying to Test Input:**\n    *   **Input Shapes & Sizes:**\n        *   **Maroon (Top-Left area):** Area ~50 pixels. Contains the Map. -> **Rank 3**.\n        *   **Grey (Bottom/Mid-Right area):** Area ~62 pixels. -> **Rank 4 (Largest)**.\n        *   **Red (Bottom-Right area):** Area ~18 pixels. -> **Rank 2**.\n        *   **Orange (Bottom-Left area):** Area 12 pixels. -> **Rank 1 (Smallest)**.\n    *   **Map Extraction:** Found inside the Maroon shape.\n        *   `3 6` (Top row)\n        *   `4 8` (Bottom row)\n        *   TL=3, TR=6, BL=4, BR=8.\n    *   **Assignments:**\n        1.  **Map Holder (Maroon, Rank 3)** goes to **Output TL**. Map color at TL is **3**.\n        2.  **Smallest Piece (Orange, Rank 1)** goes to the position of '8' in the Map. '8' is at **Output BR**. Map color is **8**.\n        3.  **2nd Smallest Piece (Red, Rank 2)** goes to **Output TR** (Standard Rule). Map color at TR is **6**.\n        4.  **Largest Piece (Grey, Rank 4)** goes to the remaining **Output BL**. Map color at BL is **4**.\n\n5.  **Construction:**\n    *   Output Size: Estimated to be 12x12 based on total pixel area (~142).\n    *   **Top-Left Region:** Color 3 (Maroon shape).\n    *   **Top-Right Region:** Color 6 (Red shape).\n    *   **Bottom-Left Region:** Color 4 (Grey shape).\n    *   **Bottom-Right Region:** Color 8 (Orange shape).\n    *   The large pieces (Maroon, Grey) are on the Left. The small pieces (Red, Orange) are on the Right.\n    *   Vertical split roughly at column 9 (9 cols left, 3 cols right).\n    *   Horizontal split roughly at row 6.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 11>\n<CANDIDATE 12>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 12x12\n333333336666\n333333366666\n333366666666\n333366666666\n336666666666\n336666666666\n333333666666\n333333666666\n444336666666\n444888866666\n488888886666\n488888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_4_step_5_image\">\nLooking at this ARC task, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1. **Key Structure**: In each input, one shape contains a 2\u00d72 grid of 4 different colors (the \"key\").

It wants me to transform a large grid into a smaller one, based on two examples and a test input.  My initial thought is to break down the task into smaller steps and look for a pattern, since this seems to be a classic ARC approach.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the inputs and outputs.  The input is a grid full of colored shapes, and the output is a smaller grid with a specific pattern. The examples are vital here: they're 20x20 input grids with outputs that are 8x8 and 10x10. The test input is 26x26.  I need to figure out what's happening.\n\nI'm given a \u201cTransformation Description.\u201d My job is to see if it works with the examples. It describes a sequence: 1) Find a \u201ccomposite object\u201d with a specific 2x2 color pattern,  2) Identify 4 main solid shapes, 3) Recolor these shapes using the pattern, 4) Fill remaining grid space by expanding the shape boundaries via Voronoi or Manhattan, 5) Crop and downsample. This seems a promising starting point.\n\nI start by testing this on Example 1. The input is a 20x20 grid, and I spot this red shape with internal pixels: 1, 5, 8, 9, arranged in a 2x2.  Other shapes are also present. The output is an 8x8 grid. It has the colors 1, 5, 8, 9, which matches the 2x2 color pattern from the red shape. Each color from the 2x2 corresponds to a region in the output grid, in the same quadrant as the shapes.\n\nEssentially, the transformation seems to be: find a 2x2 pattern inside the input, map this 2x2 pattern to the four main shape quadrants, expand shapes, and downsample. The 0-cells fill by expanding boundaries until they meet. The final output is just a scaling down, but the color assignments and boundaries are crucial.  The downsampling isn't an integer factor, but that's okay. The shape and placement information is preserved. I get it.\n\nNow, on to Example 2. It also has a 20x20 input. This time the \"code\" is located at the center, not at the top-left like in Example 1. This one is more complex, but I identify four quadrants, find the 2x2 pattern (2,4,8,3), and map each object to a color in the output. The output, a 10x10 grid, shows the same transformation pattern, but the 2x2 pattern is now the middle-left instead of the Top-Left as in the first example.  This reinforces that the spatial relationships of the shapes are important, as well as the 2x2.\n\nThe key is that the grid is downsampled by a factor of 2. The code pixel group is contained within a larger object which serves to define the locations of the 4 quadrants. Each quadrant's original color gets transformed into a pixel from the code. The non-object cells are filled by expanding until the object shapes overlap. This isn't just cropping. It's a shape-preserving resize.\n\nWith my refined understanding of the pattern, I'm ready to tackle the test input. The new input is a 26x26 grid, so the output will be 13x13. First, I identify the objects. I find the \u201ccode\u201d object. Inside, a 2x2 pixel grid (3,6,4,8) is located. Then, I define the relative spatial positions of the other objects around this code, in order to perform the color mapping. I see a maroon shape with the code inside, a grey blob to the top-right, an orange rectangle to the bottom-left, and a red rectangle to the bottom-right. Based on the examples, I know how the quadrants are now assigned to the color code. It is: top-left (maroon) -> 3, top-right (grey) -> 6, bottom-left (orange) -> 4, bottom-right (red) -> 8.\n\nNext, I need to figure out the output grid. For this I need to follow the rules from the example. I need to generate an output. Downsample the input by a factor of 2, then fill the gaps based on the nearest neighbor.\n\nFor the output grid, I scan through, mapping the 2x2 blocks of the input to pixels. If it hits an object's color, use the mapped color. If it's zero,\n\nTo solve the problem, we first analyze the transformation logic based on the provided description and examples.\n\n1.  **Identify Objects and Palette:**\n    - We scan the input grid to identify the \"composite object\" that contains the 2x2 palette.\n    - In the **Test Input**, the Maroon shape (9) in the top-left quadrant (Rows 4-11, Cols 3-12) contains a 2x2 block of distinct colors at `(Row 5, Col 4)`.\n    - The palette pixels are:\n        - `(5,4)`: 3 (Green)\n        - `(5,5)`: 6 (Magenta)\n        - `(6,4)`: 4 (Yellow)\n        - `(6,5)`: 8 (Teal)\n    - This gives us the mapping based on quadrants:\n        - Top-Left Object -> 3\n        - Top-Right Object -> 6\n        - Bottom-Left Object -> 4\n        - Bottom-Right Object -> 8\n\n2.  **Identify Main Solid Objects and Assign Colors:**\n    - **Top-Left (TL):** Maroon (9) object. Maps to **3**.\n    - **Top-Right (TR):** Grey (5) object. Maps to **6**.\n    - **Bottom-Left (BL):** Orange (7) object. Maps to **4**.\n    - **Bottom-Right (BR):** Red (2) object. Maps to **8**.\n\n3.  **Transformation (Downsampling & Growth):**\n    - The input grid is 26x26. The description and examples imply a downsampling by a factor of 2, resulting in a **13x13** output grid.\n    - We map each 2x2 block in the input to 1 pixel in the output.\n    - If a block contains pixels of an object, the output takes that object's mapped color.\n    - Empty space is filled based on the Manhattan distance to the nearest object (Voronoi tessellation).\n\n4.  **Constructing the Output Grid:**\n    - **Top Section (Rows 0-7):**\n        - Corresponds to Input Rows 0-15.\n        - Left side is dominated by the TL Object (9 -> 3).\n        - Right side is dominated by the TR Object (5 -> 6).\n        - The TL object (width ~10) is wider than the TR object in the upper section, or rather the \"gap\" falls such that the boundary is at Output Column 7. However, calculating the distances for the \"gap\" columns (Input 12-15), Input 12-13 is closer to TL, and Input 14-15 is closer to TR.\n        - Output Cols 0-6 (7 pixels) -> **3**.\n        - Output Cols 7-12 (6 pixels) -> **6**.\n    - **Transition Row (Row 8):**\n        - Corresponds to Input Rows 16-17.\n        - Left side is empty (Gap above BL object). Right side contains the tail of TR object (5).\n        - Calculating distances for the empty space: The boundary between BL (4) and TR (6) shifts left because the TR object is present in this row while BL is not (BL starts Row 19).\n        - Detailed check places the boundary after Column 4.\n        - Output Cols 0-4 (5 pixels) -> **4**.\n        - Output Cols 5-12 (8 pixels) -> **6**.\n    - **Bottom Section (Rows 9-12):**\n        - Corresponds to Input Rows 18-25.\n        - Left side contains BL Object (7 -> 4).\n        - Right side contains BR Object (2 -> 8).\n        - The BL object is narrow (Cols 3-5).

My initial thought process involves breaking down the input into recognizable objects and identifying how their colors and positions are related to the output.\n\n**First, I see several distinct shapes with different colors in the input. A special \"key\" shape, defined by a distinct \"noise\" pattern of colors, seems crucial for determining the output's structure. I hypothesize that the color distribution within this key shape acts as a color map. Based on the arrangement of color values (1,5,8,9) inside the 'Red' shape, I believe these correspond to the quadrants of the output.** I start to meticulously examine the coordinates of these \"noise pixels\" relative to the other shapes, trying to see if there's a spatial mapping.\n\n**Next, I analyze the \"geometric shapes\" of the input objects and output image by calculating their pixel sizes.** After careful examination, I hypothesize that the output could be a composition of the input shapes. I also explore the possibility of Transposing or rotating the inputs during this process, since the size and position of the output and input seemed to differ.\n\n**I started to wonder if these colors map to each quadrant of the output grid. For Example 1, I find a correlation between the colors within the \"key\" shape and the color distribution of the final image.** With deeper analysis, I confirm that each distinct color in the key shape (1,5,8,9) does correspond to a separate quadrant of the output image, and these colors determine the quadrant colors. However, now I have to figure out the geometrical transformation applied to the objects. I explore whether the input shapes are simply translated and recolored, or if they undergo Transpose or Rotation transformations before being placed in the output.\n\n**Ultimately, I think it's a combination of transposition, overlaying, and recoloring. Each quadrant is constructed by Transposing and pasting the original input shape onto the final grid. With that I came up with what I consider my working Hypothesis: The Output is a composition of transposed shapes based on the input shapes and the key from Example 1.**\n\n**Now, I think I have a general approach that would apply to solve the task.**\n\n\nThe solution involves decomposing the input grid into four distinct \"Source Shapes\" and a \"Key\" map, then transforming and assembling them into the output grid.\n\n**1. Decomposition and Mapping:**\n- The input contains four distinct shapes made of specific colors. In the test input, these are:\n    - **TL:** Maroon (9) shape.\n    - **TR:** Grey (5) shape.\n    - **BL:** Orange (7) shape.\n    - **BR:** Red (2) shape.\n- One of these shapes contains a \"Key\" consisting of single pixels of four colors arranged in a 2x2 pattern. In the test input, the Key is inside the Maroon (9) shape:\n    - `3` (Green) at Top-Left.\n    - `6` (Magenta) at Top-Right.\n    - `4` (Yellow) at Bottom-Left.\n    - `8` (Teal) at Bottom-Right.\n- This Key defines the target colors for the four input shapes based on their quadrant position:\n    - TL Input Shape (Maroon) $\\rightarrow$ Target Color **3** (Green).\n    - TR Input Shape (Grey) $\\rightarrow$ Target Color **6** (Magenta).\n    - BL Input Shape (Orange) $\\rightarrow$ Target Color **4** (Yellow).\n    - BR Input Shape (Red) $\\rightarrow$ Target Color **8** (Teal).\n\n**2. Transformation (Transpose):**\n- Each source shape is extracted (ignoring holes filled with key noise) and **transposed** (rows become columns).\n    - **Green Shape (from Maroon):** Input dimensions $\\approx$ 8x10 (HxW). Transposed $\\rightarrow$ 10x8. Solid block on left, thinning to the right (holes in original bottom rows).\n    - **Magenta Shape (from Grey):** Input dimensions $\\approx$ 12x10 (HxW). Transposed $\\rightarrow$ 10x12 (approx). Thin on left, thick on right.\n    - **Yellow Shape (from Orange):** Input is a 6x3 L-shape. Transposed $\\rightarrow$ 3x6 L-shape (rotated).\n    - **Teal Shape (from Red):** Input is a 4x6 triangle. Transposed $\\rightarrow$ 6x4 triangle.\n\n**3. Assembly:**\n- The output grid dimensions are determined by the sum of the widths of the top transposed shapes and the maximum height.\n    - Width = Width(Green) + Width(Magenta) = $8 + 10 = 18$.\n    - Height = Max(Height(Green), Height(Magenta)) = $10$.\n- The grid is split into a Left Panel (cols 0-7) and a Right Panel (cols 8-17).\n- **Left Panel:**\n    - **Top Layer:** Green Shape aligned Top-Left.\n    - **Bottom Layer:** Yellow Shape aligned Bottom-Left. The Green shape overlays the Yellow shape. Where Green has holes (0s), Yellow is visible.\n- **Right Panel:**\n    - **Top Layer:** Magenta Shape aligned Top-Left (of the panel).\n    - **Bottom Layer:** Teal Shape aligned Bottom-Right. Magenta overlays Teal. Since Magenta is dense on the right side, it mostly covers the Teal triangle.\n\n**Generated Output Grid (10x18):**\n- **Rows 0-6:** Left side is solid Green (3). Right side starts with 0s then solid Magenta (6).\n- **Row 7:** Green has a hole at col 5, revealing Yellow (4). Magenta is solid.\n- **Row 8:** Green is solid left, empty right. Yellow is visible? (Yellow shape logic implies distinct visibility).\n- **Row 9:** Green shape ends, Yellow visible at col 2.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6,6,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 19>\n<CANDIDATE 20>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 18x18\n333333333888888666\n333333333888886666\n333333333888866666\n333333333888666666\n333333333886666666\n333333333866666666\n333333333666666666\n333333333666666666\n888888886666666666\n888888886666886666\n888888886688888866\n888888886688888888\n444888888888888888\n444888888888888888\n444888888888888888\n444888888888888888\n444888888888888888\n444888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_5_step_5_deep_thinking\">\nOkay, here's my understanding of the situation and the planned solution. The user wants me to solve an ARC task, but there's a bit of a wrinkle in the instructions. The prompt emphasizes *only* revealing the final output grid and not any internal reasoning. However, it also *asks* for a detailed explanation. This seems contradictory, but I'm going to interpret it as a request for a high-level summary of my logic rather than a line-by-line breakdown. The important thing is to give the user enough insight to understand *how* the solution was derived without exposing the raw internal \"scratchpad\" work.\n\nEssentially, I'm to solve the puzzle, explain how I figured it out in a way that someone could reconstruct my steps, and then provide the final output grid. That's the core request, and I should ignore the \"fluff\" about a \"protocol override\" or \"hidden scratchpad.\" Now, I need to analyze the specific task given. It's about recognizing patterns and relationships between example inputs and outputs, and applying them to a new test input to solve it.\n\nThe overall approach seems to involve identifying a \"container\" object with a specific pattern inside. This pattern serves as a \"kernel\" or base for the final output. The positions and shapes of other objects in the input then determine the shapes and positions of regions in the final output grid. The output is a collage of these objects or regions, but colored with the kernel's colors.\n\n**Here's the planned approach:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Example Inputs:** I'll carefully examine the two example inputs to identify the \"container\" object (the one with the distinctive 2x2 internal pattern) and extract the kernel colors and relative positions of those colors. Also, I need to carefully study the \"mask\" shapes of the various objects in the grids.\n2.  **Object Classification:** I will categorize the objects based on their spatial positions (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) within the input grid.\n3.  **Output Grid Construction:**  The logic seems that each object in the input corresponds to a region in the output and is colored by one of the \"kernel\" colors. The shape of each output region is derived from its matching object shape in the input, but these objects overlap. The overall size of the output is a little unclear but likely related to the object dimensions, and I need to figure this out with the examples. The challenge will be precisely placing these objects, given that the instructions seem to indicate they may overlap in some way.\n4.  **Test Input Application:** Finally, I'll apply the identified pattern and logic to solve the test input.\n\nI'm making a key assumption here: While the prompt asks for an explanation, my final output will *only* be the grid. The explanation is something I'll write separately, as a summary of my reasoning. That's what I will produce now.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we identify a \"container\" object in the input grid that encloses a distinctive 2x2 pattern of colors. We then extract this kernel of 4 colors and map them to the four quadrants of the output grid. The shapes in the output grid are derived from the four distinct objects found in the input, scaled and arranged to form a collage.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Input and Extract the Kernel**\n- In the Test Input, the \"Container\" object is the Maroon (9) shape in the top-left region.\n- Inside this Maroon container (rows 5-6, cols 4-5 approx), we find a 2x2 set of colors:\n  - Top-Left: Green (3)\n  - Top-Right: Pink (6)\n  - Bottom-Left: Yellow (4)\n  - Bottom-Right: Teal (8)\n- This gives us our color mapping for the output quadrants:\n  - TL Region -> 3\n  - TR Region -> 6\n  - BL Region -> 4\n  - BR Region -> 8 (and Background)\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Four Objects and their Shapes**\nWe identify the four main objects in the input grid and assign them to quadrants based on their position:\n1.  **TL Object (Maroon 9):** A 9x8 block (width 9, height 8). This maps to the TL region (Color 3).\n2.  **TR Object (Gray 5):** A pyramid-like shape, width 10, height 12. Maps to the TR region (Color 6).\n3.  **BL Object (Orange 7):** A 3x6 block. Maps to the BL region (Color 4).\n4.  **BR Object (Red 2):** A 6x4 block. Maps to the BR region (Color 8).\n\n**Step 3: Determine Output Dimensions and Layout**\n- Based on the solved examples, the output width is the sum of the TL and TR object widths minus 1 (overlap).\n  - Test Width = 9 (TL) + 10 (TR) - 1 = 18.\n- The output grids in the examples are square. Following this pattern, we set the output height to 18.\n- We construct the output by placing the object shapes in their respective corners of the 18x18 grid.\n  - **TL (Color 3):** Placed at (0,0). Size 9x8.\n  - **TR (Color 6):** Placed at Top-Right. Its shape is a pyramid growing from width 3 to 10. It contains some holes near the bottom.\n  - **BL (Color 4):** Placed at Bottom-Left.

Since the background color (from the kernel's bottom-right) is also 8, this shape merges with the background.\n\n**Step 4: Construct the Grid**\n- Fill the 18x18 grid with the background color (8).\n- Draw the TL shape (Color 3) in the top-left 9x8 area.\n- Draw the TR shape (Color 6) in the top-right area (rows 0-11, cols 8-17). We reproduce the \"pyramid\" growth and the holes found in the input object.\n- Draw the BL shape (Color 4) in the bottom-left area (rows 12-17, cols 0-2).\n- The gaps remain filled with the background color (8).\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nThe resulting grid combines these elements, respecting the overlaps and geometry of the original objects.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 20>\n<CANDIDATE 21>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 12x10\n3333666666\n3333666666\n3333666666\n3333666666\n3333666666\n3333666666\n3333666666\n6666666666\n6666666666\n4444448888\n4444448888\n4444448888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\nLooking at this task, I need to identify the pattern from the examples:\n\n**Key observations from examples:**\n1.

The user wants me to solve this ARC problem. It looks like a Voronoi-type problem, but with some clever color mapping and resizing. I've got two examples and a test input to work from. Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, I looked at the examples. The input is a 20x20 grid with these colored shapes, and the output is a smaller grid with different colors and a specific region structure. The hints say \"Manhattan-distance multi-source expansion\", which screams Voronoi. But the output size is a key puzzle. Initial thoughts are maybe the output is just cropped or a rescaled representation.\n\nExample 1 is 20x20 to 8x8 and example 2 is 20x20 to 10x10. That output size variance has to be from the input, maybe. Is it the number of pixels in the active region? I looked for markers or a crop region, but the hints pointed me back to the shapes' layout.\n\nA key observation here is the mapping of colors, it seems related to the position of the shapes. Inside of one of the shapes (the Key Shape), there were *intruder* colors. Those intruder colors seem to define the output color of the corresponding regions. It looks like it is 2x2 blocks that define the output.\n\nAnalyzing the hints, \"Manhattan-distance multi-source expansion\" confirms Voronoi. Hint 4 says each output region gets a single color, which means color remapping, not direct mapping. But what grid is the expansion on? Since the size differs for the same input, the hint makes me guess that maybe the input dictates the output dimensions. Maybe Voronoi is performed on the *original input grid*, but then it gets downsampled somehow?\n\nI looked at the colors in the key shape and the intruder pixels inside the blocks and compared them with the output to find a pattern. I was able to find a pattern! The intruder pixels of one of the shapes are related to the output colors. It's a 2x2 intruder region (key) that dictates output colors. The location of pixels within that region determines colors of corresponding output regions.\n\nNow, how to determine the output size? The shapes give the dimensions. I calculated bounding boxes, distances between shapes, and empty spaces. Nothing. Maybe active area? Maybe it's encoded inside the Key shape? No. Finally, I noticed the outputs are always smaller than the original input dimensions. It feels like the solution lies with the active portion of the Voronoi diagrams.\n\nLet's look more closely at the examples. The size has to be derived from the input's geometry, as it changes. Maybe the empty areas define the dimensions? The 20x20 input maps to smaller values. Is the output grid just a *crop* from the full Voronoi diagram on the original grid? Then it dawned on me to look at the boundaries of the output. I can see the \"cross\" structure (boundaries between the regions, Voronoi). Now I need to know the crop box, and what is its dimension.\n\nSo the Output is Voronoi on the full input grid, and some part of it is shown in the output, and is cropped or rescaled? I needed to determine the correct size for the output. So I will see if there is a pattern to the size. The output size is probably some derivation of the input bounding box. Maybe a scale or divider. It is probably related to an active range of rows and columns. In the examples, the shapes use different amount of space. This makes me suspect that that range has to be used to map the value to an output dimension. The key to the solution is likely: use Voronoi on the *full input grid* and then extract the output. Now I had to find how the extraction is defined. The tricky part is the *output grid size*.\n\nI looked at the distances between shapes and at the size of the key pattern. No joy. Okay, let's go back to the cropping. It's Voronoi, right, so it's a grid based on the \"seeds.\" I looked at the bounding boxes for the shapes and how the key and all that relates. But I saw that the 20x20 to 8x8 mapping doesn't seem to work, or rather doesn't have a clear ratio. Maybe it is the area that is completely covered with the Voronoi, with the boundaries only? That defines the active range. Now I see that I can map the bounds of the active ranges to a number of blocks, using blocks 2x2 in size. I realized to find this pattern that I need to look for that pattern in both examples, and test on\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing four distinct colored shapes into a smaller grid partitioned into four regions. By analyzing the solved examples, we can deduce the following rules:\n\n1.  **Identify Seed Shapes**: The input grid contains four separate groups of colored pixels.

The task is to analyze two solved examples, then solve a new one. I need to figure out the pattern relating input and output, particularly how to map the colors and the output grid size.\n\nFirst, I examine the examples. In Example 1, I see four distinct groups of colors, one containing a 2x2 \"key\" pattern. The output seems to divide space based on these groups, using colors from the key. The output size is smaller (8x8) than the input (20x20). I check Example 2 for confirmation. Again, four groups, with a key. The output is 10x10. The regions in the output match the key's positions: Top-Left maps to the Top-Left key color, Top-Right maps to Top-Right, and so on.\n\nThe hint about \"Voronoi-like territory assignment\" clicks.  The input groups act as seeds. The space is being partitioned into regions, which are then colored according to a hidden 2x2 key within *one* of the input groups. The regions are stair-stepped, which matches Manhattan distance. This means I'm supposed to find the 2x2 key within an input group, map it to quadrant positions, and generate a Voronoi diagram (using Manhattan distance) on the input, then color each region appropriately.\n\nBut why the size change? In both examples, the outputs are smaller. Maybe the prompt is using cropped examples. The prompt is also explicit about the output sizes (8x8, 10x10). Is the output size fixed, or related to the input somehow? The bounding box of the non-black pixels? No simple linear scaling.  It's not the key dimensions either. I'll note that the input and output sizes are *different*.\n\nI then analyze the test input. It's 26x26. I find the four groups and the hidden key: [[3, 6], [4, 8]]. Quadrant mapping is: Group 9 (TL) -> Key TL (3), Group 5 (TR) -> Key TR (6), Group 7 (BL) -> Key BL (4), Group 2 (BR) -> Key BR (8). So the output colors are 3, 6, 4, and 8 for the four quadrants respectively.\n\nI hypothesize that output size should match input size, (26x26).  The examples are truncated! I'll note this assumption. I'm going to proceed to generate a 26x26 grid, since the prompt states \"fill the grid\". The hint about \"completely fill the grid\" makes me think that's it!\n\n**Algorithm**: I identified the groups (the connected components). I located the 2x2 keys in a group. I classified the groups by quadrant (TL, TR, BL, BR) based on their centroids. I mapped the key colors to the quadrants.\n\nFor the output generation, I'll calculate the Voronoi regions using Manhattan distance. I will output a full 26x26 grid (since no obvious size logic emerged), filling the grid with the colors 3, 6, 4, 8 for each respective quadrant, based on the *relative position* of the input groups.\n\n*Refining the Process: I am simulating the Voronoi pattern in my mind, since I cannot run code.*\n\nMy \"final grid plan\" creates the 26x26 output using these steps:\n  - Row 0..15:\n    - Cols 0..15: Color 3.\n    - Cols 16..25: Color 6.\n  - Row 16..25:\n    - Cols 0..11: Color 4.\n    - Cols 12..25: Color 8.\n\nThe shift in the vertical line (from x=15 to x=11) creates the stair step, as expected. I am confident! The colors and the positions are all correct, and the \"stair-stepped\" property is satisfied.\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task based on two examples and a test input.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal**: The inputs consist of four separated \"foreground\" groups of colored pixels on a black background. The outputs are grids fully filled with four connected regions of solid color. The task is to partition the grid into four regions based on the input groups and color them according to a specific logic.\n\n2.  **Determine the Partitioning (Geometry)**:\n    *   The hints and visual inspection of the examples suggest a **Voronoi-like partition** using Manhattan distance.\n    *   This means each pixel in the output grid is assigned to the \"nearest\" input group.\n    *   The \"seeds\" for the Voronoi regions are the entire shapes of the input groups.\n    *   Boundaries are formed where pixels are equidistant from two groups.\n    *   In the Test Input (26x26), we can determine the boundaries by finding the midpoints between the bounding boxes of the groups.\n        *   **Horizontal Split (Top vs Bottom)**:\n            *   Top groups (TL, TR) end roughly at row 11.\n            *   Bottom groups (BL, BR) start roughly at row 19 (BL) and 20 (BR).\n            *   The gap is roughly rows 12-18. The midpoint is row 15.\n            *   Pixels in rows 0-15 are closer to the Top groups. Pixels in rows 16-25 are closer to the Bottom groups.\n        *   **Vertical Split (Top Half: TL vs TR)**:\n            *   Top-Left (TL) group ends at col 12. Top-Right (TR) group starts at col 19.\n            *   Gap is cols 13-18. Midpoint is between 15 and 16.\n            *   Cols 0-15 are closer to TL. Cols 16-25 are closer to TR.\n        *   **Vertical Split (Bottom Half: BL vs BR)**:\n            *   Bottom-Left (BL) group ends at col 5. Bottom-Right (BR) group starts at col 17.\n            *   Gap is cols 6-16 (11 columns). The exact middle is col 11 (distance 6 from both sides).\n            *   Assigning the tie to the left, Cols 0-11 are BL. Cols 12-25 are BR.\n\n3.  **Determine the Coloring (Topology)**:\n    *   In both examples, one of the four input groups contains a \"Key\": a 2x2 block of four distinct colors hidden inside the group's main color.\n    *   This Key defines the colors for the four output regions based on their quadrant position (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n    *   **Finding the Key in Test Input**:\n        *   Scanning the groups, the Top-Left group (Main color 9) contains a 2x2 pattern at rows 5-6 and cols 4-5 (indices 0-based):\n            *   (Row 5, Col 4): **3**\n            *   (Row 5, Col 5): **6**\n            *   (Row 6, Col 4): **4**\n            *   (Row 6, Col 5): **8**\n        *   The Key is `[[3, 6], [4, 8]]`.\n    *   **Mapping to Regions**:\n        *   Top-Left Region gets the Top-Left Key color: **3** (Green).\n        *   Top-Right Region gets the Top-Right Key color: **6** (Magenta).\n        *   Bottom-Left Region gets the Bottom-Left Key color: **4** (Yellow).\n        *   Bottom-Right Region gets the Bottom-Right Key color: **8** (Azure).\n\n4.  **Construct the Output**:\n    *   Create a 26x26 grid.\n    *   Fill **Rows 0-15, Cols 0-15** with Color **3**.\n    *   Fill **Rows 0-15, Cols 16-25** with Color **6**.\n    *   Fill **Rows 16-25, Cols 0-11** with Color **4**.\n    *   Fill **Rows 16-25, Cols 12-25** with Color **8**.\n\noutput:\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

\u2192 color **6**\n  - BL: the 7-group \u2192 color **4**\n  - BR: the 2-group \u2192 color **8**\n- After downscaling and cropping to the seed bbox, the output grid is **11\u00d712**, filled by the

model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n### 1) Identify the 4 \u201cseed\u201d groups and the 2\u00d72 color key\nEach input has **four separated non-black connected components** (ignoring small internal colors inside a component). These four components act as **multi-source seeds**.\n\nOne of the components contains a **2\u00d72 block of four distinct colors** embedded inside it; this is a **color key** that tells which single color to paint each final region:\n\nIn the test input, inside the large **9** component there is a 2\u00d72 block:\n- top-left = **3**\n- top-right = **6**\n- bottom-left = **4**\n- bottom-right = **8**\n\nSo after we decide which cells belong to the *top-left seed*, *top-right seed*, *bottom-left seed*, *bottom-right seed*, we recolor those regions with **3, 6, 4, 8** respectively.\n\n### 2) Work on a reduced \u201cplanning\u201d grid (scale down by 2)\nAs in the solved examples, we form the output on a smaller grid by:\n1. Cropping a square around all nonzero content, padding with black as needed so the side length is even.\n2. **Downscaling by factor 2** (each output cell corresponds to a 2\u00d72 block of the cropped square).  \n   Any 2\u00d72 block that intersects one of the four components becomes a seed cell for that component in the reduced grid.\n\nFor this test, that produces a **12\u00d712** reduced grid with four seed areas (corresponding to the 9-, 5-, 7-, and 2-components).\n\n### 3) Manhattan Voronoi fill from the 4 seed areas\nOn that 12\u00d712 grid, fill every cell by assigning it to the seed component with the **smallest Manhattan distance** (multi-source BFS / Voronoi in L1 metric). This creates 4 connected regions that completely fill the grid with stair-stepped borders.\n\n### 4) Recolor regions using the 2\u00d72 key\nFinally recolor:\n- region of the **top-left** seed \u2192 **3**\n- region of the **top-right** seed \u2192 **6**\n- region of the **bottom-left** seed \u2192 **4**\n- region of the **bottom-right** seed \u2192 **8**\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n4,4,4,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,6,6  \n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 28>\n</INPUT_DATA>\n\n<AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\nExecute this pipeline sequentially for every Candidate.

The task is to take a set of shapes in an input grid, and somehow translate that into a new, differently sized, grid. It's not a straightforward scaling or copying, there's some kind of logic at play. I've analyzed two example cases to uncover the pattern. It seems there is a core algorithm that involves the following steps:\n1.  **Identify 4 Main Shapes** In a complex grid, there's usually a central region containing a code. Identify this region's shape and assign it as Shape A. Find the other three distinct shapes. These are your shape pool, A, B, C, and D.\n2.  **Locate the Hidden Code** Inside that central region, there is a coded structure of pixels. This code has important details. The inner pixels within this primary shape serve as a mapping key.\n3.  **Determine Output Grid Structure** Analyze input/output size ratios in given examples.\n4.  **Map Shapes to Output Quadrants** Arrange your Shapes A, B, C and D across your new grid. The arrangement has rules, discovered in Ex 1 and Ex 2. The code in the primary shape maps to relative positions on the new grid. Specifically, it seems to encode a \"quadrant\" mapping.\n5.  **Assign Colors** Assign the colors, from each shapes to locations in your new output. The code's colors specify the color mapping between regions on the input and output grids.\n6.  **Shape Assembly** In the output grid, the new shapes are tiled together. The shapes are assembled and adjusted to create the new overall output.\n7.  **Shape Z-Indexing** Resolve conflicts when shapes overlap in certain locations.\n\nIn the Test input, the key challenge lies in the overlap. It seems shapes are cropped, merged, or z-indexed to make the resulting shape. I will assume a Z-index on code values such that, in an overlap, the shape with higher code gets priority. So, let's assemble the test based on these points.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we transform a 26x26 input grid into an output grid based on patterns inferred from two examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The input grid contains four distinct colored shapes (connected components of non-zero integers).\n    *   In the Test Input, these are:\n        *   **Maroon (9)**: A large shape in the Top-Left.\n        *   **Grey (5)**: A large shape in the Top-Right.\n        *   **Orange (7)**: A smaller shape in the Bottom-Left.\n        *   **Red (2)**: A smaller shape in the Bottom-Right.\n\n2.  **The \"Code\":** One of the shapes contains a 2x2 pattern of \"intruder\" pixels (colors different from the shape's main color). This 2x2 pattern acts as a key for the output.\n    *   In Example 1, the Top-Left Red shape contained: `1 5` on the top row and `8 9` on the bottom row.\n    *   In Example 2, the Top-Left (relative) Magenta shape contained: `2 4` / `8 3`.\n    *   In the **Test Input**, the Maroon (9) shape contains the code. Looking at rows 5-6 (global) and cols 4-5 (relative to the shape's interior):\n        *   Row 5: `... 9, 3, 6, 9 ...` -> Top row of code is **3, 6**.\n        *   Row 6: `... 9, 4, 8, 9 ...` -> Bottom row of code is **4, 8**.\n    *   The Code is:\n        ```\n        3 6\n        4 8\n        ```\n    *   This Code defines the color and relative position of the four shapes in the output grid:\n        *   **Top-Left (TL): Color 3 (Green)**\n        *   **Top-Right (TR): Color 6 (Magenta)**\n        *   **Bottom-Left (BL): Color 4 (Yellow)**\n        *   **Bottom-Right (BR): Color 8 (Teal)**\n\n3.  **Mapping Shapes to Quadrants:** We need to determine which input shape maps to which output quadrant.\n    *   In Example 1:\n        *   Input TL (Red) -> Output TL (Color 1).\n        *   Input TR (Orange) -> Output TR (Color 5).\n        *   Input BR (Green) -> Output BL (Color 8).\n        *   Input BL (Yellow) -> Output BR (Color 9).\n    *   In Example 2:\n        *   Input TL (Magenta) -> Output TL (Color 2).\n        *   Input TR (Grey) -> Output BL (Color 8).\n        *   Input BL (Maroon) -> Output BR (Color 3).\n        *   Input BR (Blue) -> Output TR (Color 4).\n    *   Comparing the Test Input to the examples, we follow the pattern of assembling the puzzle. The shapes are tessellated to form a complete rectangle.\n    *   Based on shape sizes and dimensions in the Test Input (Maroon ~10x8, Grey ~10x12, Red ~6x4, Orange ~3x6), and assuming a **13x13** output grid (fitting the width 10+3=13 and height 8+? or 12+?), we map:\n        *   **Output TL (Color 3)** corresponds to the **Maroon (TL)** input shape.\n        *   **Output TR (Color 6)** corresponds to the **Red (BR)** input shape.\n        *   **Output BL (Color 4)** corresponds to the **Grey (TR)** input shape.\n        *   **Output BR (Color 8)** corresponds to the **Orange (BL)** input shape.\n    *   This involves moving the input shapes to their respective corners in the output grid:\n        *   Maroon (Color 9 in input) becomes **Color 3** at (0,0).\n        *   Red (Color 2 in input) becomes **Color 6** at Top-Right.\n        *   Grey (Color 5 in input) becomes **Color 4** at Bottom-Left.\n        *   Orange (Color 7 in input) becomes **Color 8** at Bottom-Right.\n\n4.  **Construction:**\n    *   The output grid size is determined to be **13x13** to accommodate the shapes.\n    *   **Layer 1 (TL, Color 3):** The Maroon shape is placed at (0,0).\n    *   **Layer 2 (TR, Color 6):** The Red shape is placed at the top-right corner.\n    *   **Layer 3 (BL, Color 4):** The Grey shape is placed at the bottom-left corner.\n    *   **Layer 4 (BR, Color 8):** The Orange shape is placed at the bottom-right corner.\n    *   Overlaps are resolved by priority (Later shapes overwrite earlier ones, or strictly tessellated). Given the tight fit, the shapes essentially tile the grid.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n\n*   **TL (Maroon -> 3):** A large block occupying the top-left.\n*   **TR (Red -> 6):** A triangle wedge in the top-right.\n*   **BL (Grey -> 4):** A large block occupying the bottom-left.\n*   **BR (Orange -> 8):** A strip in the bottom-right.\n\n**Step-by-step Grid Fill (13x13):**\n*   **Row 0:** Maroon (width 10) `3333333333` + Red (width 3, top of triangle) `666`. Total `3333333333666`.\n*   **Row 1:** Maroon (width 10) `3333333333` + Red (width 4) `6666`. Overlap at col 9? Assuming Red is Top-Right aligned, it occupies cols 9-12. Maroon occupies 0-9. `3333333336666`.\n*   ... (Continuing for all rows, handling the specific shape geometries).\n    *   Maroon shape is 10 wide, 8 high.\n    *   Red shape is 6 wide, 4 high.\n    *   Grey shape is 10 wide, 12 high.\n    *   Orange shape is 3 wide, 6 high.\n\nWait, Grey (height 12) at BL + Maroon (height 8) at TL = 20 height? This implies significant overlap or a larger grid. However, checking widths: Maroon (10) + Orange (3) = 13. Grey (10) + Red (6) = 16 (too wide).\nActually, the Grey shape maps to **TR** in Ex 2's logic? No, Grey was TR in Input, mapped to BL in Output.\nLet's stick to the visual puzzle assembly.\n*   Top Left: Maroon (3).\n*   Top Right: Red (6).\n*   Bottom Left: Grey (4).\n*   Bottom Right: Orange (8).\n\nFinal check on pixel values for row 0 of output:\nMaroon (row 0): `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3`.\nRed (row 0): `2,2,2` -> `6,6,6`.\nCombined: `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6`.\n\nCompleted Output Grid:\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"1\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nOkay, let's see. The task is to analyze these ARC problem examples and then figure out a solution. I see two examples and a test input. The goal is to produce an output grid from an input grid, based on some rules.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Hypotheses:**\n\nIt looks like the output is derived from some smaller pieces of the input grid. I'm seeing shapes and colors. My initial hypothesis is that there are 4 main regions to consider: Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, and Bottom-Right, both in the input and output. The output grid seems to be formed by combining or modifying the information in those regions, based on a key element.\n\nThe key seems to be located in the top-left section of the input, in a container of one color, and containing a small grid of *noise* of another four colors. The colors of the other three shapes and the *noise* in the container are the source of the information. The output grid looks to have those four noise colors in their respective quadrants, so I'm thinking the noise dictates the final colors.\n\n**Shape Analysis and Mapping:**\n\nI'm now looking at the shape and trying to identify if the output is just a scaled/transformed version of an input shape. Not quite! Shapes appear to be transformed, but pixel counts often don't match. Rotations are important, and it seems like the key is related to the transformations. The sizes of the output blocks are the key. If the shape is too large, the output is larger, but if it is smaller, it's also a part of the output.\n\nIn the first example, the color of the output is determined by the \"noise\", and the color arrangement is determined by position in the output: The colors are arranged similarly in quadrants, following the arrangement of the \"noise\" inside the key. This is a very interesting concept.\n\nSo I'm thinking, in each quadrant, the input region determines the shape of that region in the output. But the color of that region is determined by the \"noise\", specifically from the small grid within the frame. The rotation, resizing, and layering of the pieces are crucial. And it looks like the 9 is also a color from a corner.\n\n**Identifying the Transformation Logic:**\n\nWhat does the mapping/transformation look like? Maybe a 90-degree clockwise rotation, since the shapes seem to be arranged in quadrants? Okay, so all the shapes should be rotated 90 deg clockwise. The pixel counts help me narrow it down. The small triangle shape seems to be unchanged. In Example 2, something similar happens. One shape does a 180 and swaps.\n\nAfter closer look, it's a mix of a rotation and a swap. In Example 2, some shapes are rotated by 180 degrees and swapped. In Example 1, something similar happened, a swap by swapping positions in the output. The shapes don't rotate to match, but rather the color of the shape matches.\n\n**Test Input Approach:**\n\nSo for the test input, I will:\n\n1.  Isolate the 4 shapes\n2.  Extract the Key (noise pixels) and their position.\n3.  Perform rotations, and apply these.\n4.  Fit the rotated (or un-rotated) shapes into the correct quadrants.\n\nThe key has a frame like structure. If it follows the Ex 1 logic, one quadrant is kept unchanged, with others rotated. Let's start building up the grid now. It looks like the S_TL (the Key shape in the upper left corner) is defining my new output size. I think that's it. Let's do this!\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the test input grid based on the rules inferred from two examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid always contains four distinct clusters of colored pixels (shapes) located roughly in the four quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n2.  **The Key:** One of the shapes (always the Top-Left one in the examples and test input) acts as a \"container\" for a 2x2 key. This key consists of four pixels of different colors near the center of the container shape.\n    *   The 2x2 key layout corresponds to the four quadrants of the output grid.\n    *   Key(0,0) -> Color for Output Top-Left.\n    *   Key(0,1) -> Color for Output Top-Right.\n    *   Key(1,0) -> Color for Output Bottom-Left.\n    *   Key(1,1) -> Color for Output Bottom-Right.\n3.  **Mapping Rules:**\n    *   **Colors:** The output quadrants take the colors specified by the key.\n    *   **Shapes:** The shapes from the input quadrants are mapped to the output quadrants.\n        *   **Top-Left (TL):** The input TL shape is mapped to the output TL quadrant. It is **not rotated**.\n        *   **Top-Right (TR):** The input TR shape is mapped to the output TR quadrant. It is **rotated 90 degrees clockwise**.\n        *   **Bottom-Left (BL) and Bottom-Right (BR):** These two swap positions.\n            *   The input **Bottom-Right** shape is mapped to the output **Bottom-Left** quadrant. It is **rotated 90 degrees clockwise**.\n            *   The input **Bottom-Left** shape is mapped to the output **Bottom-Right** quadrant. It is **rotated 90 degrees clockwise**.\n4.  **Grid Construction:** The output grid is assembled by placing these transformed shapes into their respective corners. The total width is the sum of the widths of the left and right components. The total height is the sum of the heights of the top and bottom components.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key and Colors:**\n    *   The TL container (Color 9) has the key:\n        ```\n        3 6\n        4 8\n        ```\n    *   **Output TL Color:** 3\n    *   **Output TR Color:** 6\n    *   **Output BL Color:** 4\n    *   **Output BR Color:** 8\n\n2.  **Extract and Measure Input Shapes:**\n    *   **S_TL (Top-Left, Color 9):**\n        *   Shape includes the frame of 9s.\n        *   Dimensions: 10 pixels wide x 8 pixels high.\n    *   **S_TR (Top-Right, Color 5):**\n        *   Dimensions: 10 pixels wide x 12 pixels high.\n    *   **S_BL (Bottom-Left, Color 7):**\n        *   Dimensions: 3 pixels wide x 6 pixels high.\n    *   **S_BR (Bottom-Right, Color 2):**\n        *   Dimensions: 6 pixels wide x 4 pixels high.\n\n3.  **Transform Shapes:**\n    *   **T_TL (Output TL):** Source S_TL (9). **No Rotation**. Color becomes 3.\n        *   Size: 10x8.\n    *   **T_TR (Output TR):** Source S_TR (5). **Rotate 90 CW**. Color becomes 6.\n        *   Original 10x12 -> Rotated 12x10.\n        *   Size: 12x10.\n    *   **T_BL (Output BL):** Source S_BR (2). **Rotate 90 CW**. Color becomes 4.\n        *   Original 6x4 -> Rotated 4x6.\n        *   Size: 4x6.\n    *   **T_BR (Output BR):** Source S_BL (7). **Rotate 90 CW**. Color becomes 8.\n        *   Original 3x6 -> Rotated 6x3.\n        *   Size: 6x3.\n\n4.  **Assemble Output Grid:**\n    *   **Width:** Max(Width(T_TL), Width(T_BL)) + Max(Width(T_TR), Width(T_BR))\n        *   Left Column Width: Max(10, 4) = 10.\n        *   Right Column Width: Max(12, 6) = 12.\n        *   Total Width: 10 + 12 = 22.\n    *   **Height:** Max(Height(T_TL), Height(T_TR)) + Max(Height(T_BL), Height(T_BR))\n        *   Top Row Height: Max(8, 10) = 10.\n        *   Bottom Row Height: Max(6, 3) = 6.\n        *   Total Height: 10 + 6 = 16.\n    *   **Placement:**\n        *   T_TL placed at (0, 0).\n        *   T_TR placed at (0, 10) [Row 0, Col 10].\n        *   T_BL placed at (10, 0) [Row 10, Col 0].\n        *   T_BR placed at (10, 10) [Row 10, Col 10].\n\n**Constructing the Grid:**\n*   **T_TL (3s):** Copy the shape of 9s from input, replace with 3.\n*   **T_TR (6s):** Rotate the shape of 5s from input 90\u00b0 CW, replace with 6.\n*   **T_BL (4s):** Rotate the shape of 2s from input 90\u00b0 CW, replace with 4.\n*   **T_BR (8s):** Rotate the shape of 7s from input 90\u00b0 CW, replace with 8.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"2\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation from the examples:\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.

The user wants me to translate an input grid into an output grid based on a few examples, and I think I've cracked it.**\n\nEssentially, it's about identifying \"anchor\" shapes and using a \"key\" inside one of them to map their relative positions to colors in the output. The input is a 20x20 grid, and the key is a 2x2 colored region contained within one of the larger shapes. The spatial arrangement of four distinct shapes (excluding the black background) is the key; a Top-Left shape might house this region, and others follow.\n\nThe \"key\" is critical because the values it contains determine the colors in the output grid. The algorithm determines the positions of the Shapes relative to each other. For example: if Top-Left of key is color 1 and that key is inside a red shape, any shape positioned Top-Left in the input gets the \"1\" color in the output.\n\nAnalyzing the examples, the outputs represent a downsampled and colored version of the spatial layout of shapes. The output size (8x8 or 10x10) appears related to the input size somehow. It seems to be a 2x2 sample of the input and the colors of the resulting downsampled shapes are assigned based on the key.\n\nThe specific examples show that there are four colored regions, and the output is colored based on the colors found in the hole of the larger shape.\n\nIn the first example, the inner part of a red frame contains the colors 1,5,8,9, and the frame is Top-Left in the input grid. This becomes the basis for the colors of large sections in the 8x8 output. The shapes act as territories or anchors. The position is critical.\n\nThe second example confirms the same logic: The relative spatial positions of other shapes is mapped to the inner-color-values of a selected key shape.\n\nTherefore the logic:\n\n1.  Identify the 4 distinct non-black shapes and their relative position. These are your spatial anchors (Top-Left, Top-Right, etc.).\n2.  Find the \"Key\". Locate a 2x2 block of colors within *one* of the larger shapes and record their TL, TR, BL, BR values.\n3.  Based on Key values, determine mapping. The values inside the Key are your target output colors. Each position within the key maps to a corresponding spatial region.\n\nThe crucial detail: Output size seems a downsampled version of the input, possibly by a factor of 2 (or based on active grid size + Padding / 2). The background (black) is replaced with the color of the \"nearest\" shape. A Voronoi diagram of the input's layout.\nI think the output size is the input's active grid dimensions divided by 2.\n\nIn the given test case, I'll generate the output based on this. Let's see how it goes.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we need to understand the relationship between the shapes in the input grid and the colored regions in the output grid.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the \"Key\" and Shape Mapping\nIn both solved examples, there are four large colored shapes positioned roughly in the four quadrants of the grid (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). One of these shapes contains a \"Key\" \u2014 a 2x2 block of distinct colors inside its hollow interior.\n\n*   **Example 1**:\n    *   **Input Shapes**: Red (Top-Left), Orange (Top-Right), Yellow (Bottom-Left), Green (Bottom-Right).\n    *   **Key**: Found inside the Red shape. The 2x2 pixels are:\n        *   Top-Left: 1 (Blue)\n        *   Top-Right: 5 (Grey)\n        *   Bottom-Left: 8 (Teal)\n        *   Bottom-Right: 9 (Maroon)\n    *   **Output**: The grid is divided into regions corresponding to the input shapes.\n        *   The Red shape (Top-Left) area becomes Color 1.\n        *   The Orange shape (Top-Right) area becomes Color 5.\n        *   The Yellow shape (Bottom-Left) area becomes Color 8.\n        *   The Green shape (Bottom-Right) area becomes Color 9.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The Key maps the spatial position of the shapes to the target colors. Specifically, $Key_{Position} \\rightarrow Color_{Target}$.\n\n*   **Example 2**:\n    *   **Input Shapes**: Magenta (Top-Left region), Grey (Top-Right region), Maroon (Bottom-Left region), Blue (Bottom-Right region).\n    *   **Key**: Found inside the Magenta shape.\n        *   Top-Left: 2 (Red)\n        *   Top-Right: 4 (Yellow)\n        *   Bottom-Left: 8 (Teal)\n        *   Bottom-Right: 3 (Green)\n    *   **Output**:\n        *   Top-Left region (Magenta area) -> 2.\n        *   Top-Right region (Grey area) -> 4.\n        *   Bottom-Left region (Maroon area) -> 8.\n        *   Bottom-Right region (Blue area) -> 3.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Output Dimensions and Geometry\nThe output grid appears to be a downsampled \"map\" of the input grid.\n*   **Example 1**: Input 20x20 $\\rightarrow$ Output 8x8. (Scale factor 2.5).\n*   **Example 2**: Input 20x20 $\\rightarrow$ Output 10x10. (Scale factor 2).\n*   **Test Input**: Input 26x26.\n    *   Using a scale factor of 2 (consistent with Example 2 and integer division), the output should be **13x13**.\n\nThe filling logic resembles a Voronoi diagram or Nearest Neighbor scaling: each pixel in the output grid corresponds to a coordinate in the input grid. The color is determined by the closest input \"Shape\" centroid, using the mapping derived from the Key.\n\n### Step 3: Apply to Test Input\n1.  **Identify Shapes**:\n    *   **Top-Left**: Maroon (9) shape.\n    *   **Top-Right**: Grey (5) shape.\n    *   **Bottom-Left**: Orange (7) shape.\n    *   **Bottom-Right**: Red (2) shape.\n\n2.  **Read the Key**:\n    *   The Key is inside the Maroon (9) shape (rows 5-6, cols 4-5 roughly).\n    *   Row 5 inside hole: `3, 6`\n    *   Row 6 inside hole: `4, 8`\n    *   **Mapping**:\n        *   **TL** (Maroon region) $\\rightarrow$ **3** (Green)\n        *   **TR** (Grey region) $\\rightarrow$ **6** (Magenta)\n        *   **BL** (Orange region) $\\rightarrow$ **4** (Yellow)\n        *   **BR** (Red region) $\\rightarrow$ **8** (Teal)\n\n3.  **Estimate Centroids**:\n    Based on the input grid provided:\n    *   **TL (Maroon)**: Center approx (7.5, 7.5).\n    *   **TR (Grey)**: Center approx (13, 21).\n    *   **BL (Orange)**: Center approx (21, 5).\n    *   **BR (Red)**: Center approx (21.5, 20).\n\n4.  **Construct Output Grid (13x13)**:\n    We sample the input space. For an output cell $(r, c)$, the corresponding input coordinate is roughly $(2r+1, 2c+1)$. We assign the color of the nearest centroid.\n\n    *   **Row 0** (Input $y \\approx 1$):\n        *   Closer to TL(3) on the left, TR(6) on the right.\n        *   Boundary calc: $x \\approx 18$ (Input col). Output col $c \\approx 8.5$.\n        *   Result: 9 cells of **3**, 4 cells of **6**.\n    *   **Row 12** (Input $y \\approx 25$):\n        *   Closer to BL(4) on the left, BR(8) on the right.\n        *   Boundary calc: $x \\approx 12.5$ (Input col). Output col $c \\approx 5.75$.\n        *   Result: 6 cells of **4**, 7 cells of **8**.\n    *   **Vertical Transitions**:\n        *   Left side (Col 0): Transition from 3 to 4 around Row 6/7.\n        *   Right side (Col 12): Transition from 6 to 8 around Row 8/9.\n\n    By interpolating these boundaries, we construct the grid.\n\n    *   **Rows 0-5**: The boundary between 3 and 6 is around col 8/9.\n    *   **Rows 6-7**: Transition rows where 3 becomes 4 on the left.\n    *   **Rows 8-12**: The boundary between 4 and 8 is around col 5/6.\n\n    Simulated Grid Rows:\n    *   R0-R2: `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6`\n    *   R3-R5: Boundary shifts slightly left as we go down and Grey gets closer. `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6`\n    *   R6-R7: Left side becomes 4. Right side stays 6 then becomes 8.\n    *   R8-R12: Bottom half. `4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\n    Precise calculation yields the final grid below.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,6,6,6,6\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"6\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Initial Assessment & Hypothesis Formation**\n\nMy initial task involves creating a program that takes two examples and a test input and processes an ARC-based grid-based problem. I must analyze two examples. From those, I hypothesize there's a specific pattern: it involves extracting shapes from a grid and re-coloring them based on some coded relationship. There's a 20x20 input and an 8x8 output. There are shapes colored as red (2), orange (7), yellow (4), and green (3). I realized there are four distinct shapes in four quadrants of a 20x20 input grid. The shapes are \"containers\" holding information - internal pixels which are the real information to extract from the input.\n\n**Deconstructing the Example**\n\nMy mind is now diving into the details. I see in example 1 an 8x8 output. I can see the shapes: A red square with some internal pixel info (1,5,8,9) in it. I have to look into this info carefully.\nI focus on the \"noise\" or \"inner pixels\" of these shapes. The key insight is that the output grid seems to be structured according to these inner pixels of one \"key\" shape. For example, the top-left quadrant of the output is filled with ones and nines. Could this be?\nLooking at it again, 1, 5, 8, and 9 are the inner pixels in the red shape! And, these numbers are also the colors assigned to the four quadrants of the output. The top-left 4x4 area of the 8x8 grid contains ones and nines, the top-right 4x4 has fives, the bottom left has eights and nines, and the bottom right has nines.\n\n**Building the Logic**\n\nThis is starting to make sense: The internal numbers in the red \"key\" shape (1, 5, 8, 9) define the colors that should fill the four quadrants in the output. I am sure that this mapping determines how the colors are assigned. I suspect the task is to extract the 4 shapes, color them according to the legend found inside one of them, and combine them into the output. I also realized that the output grid's size equals the sum of its quadrant sizes. For example, example 2, 10x10. I noticed that 5+5=10. This is very important.\n\n**Generalizing the Approach**\n\nNow I have a generalized strategy:\n1.  Identify the four main objects in the input.\n2.  Find the \"key\" object (the one with the coded \"inner pixels\").\n3.  The color code maps to locations of the shapes in the 2x2 grid.\n4.  Draw each shape with the colors according to the code on the output canvas.\n\nI begin to test it with a test input. It looks like the same approach works.\n\n**Finalizing and Implementing**\n\nNow I have a solid approach to the problem:\n1.  Read the input.\n2.  Extract the four shape's boundaries, colors and coordinates.\n3.  Find the shape with the color key.\n4.  Get shape layout.\n5.  Generate the output grid.\n   The output structure will be made from:\n   *   Width=Width(TL) + Width(BR)\n   *   Height=Height(TL) + Height(TR)\n\nThis is what I will implement. This approach should work based on my analysis of the pattern.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on a pattern inferred from two examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Identification of Shapes:** The input grid contains four distinct colored objects, one in each quadrant (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n2.  **The \"Key\" Shape:** One of these shapes contains a 2x2 block of pixels with different colors inside it (a \"code\").\n    *   In Example 1, the Red shape (TL) contains `1, 5, 8, 9`.\n    *   In Example 2, the Green shape (TL) contains `2, 4, 8, 3` (inferred from position).\n    *   In the Test Input, the Maroon shape (TL) contains `3, 6, 4, 8`.\n3.  **Code Mapping:** The 2x2 code maps the four positions (TL, TR, BL, BR) to four specific colors.\n    *   Top-Left pixel of code -> Color for TL shape.\n    *   Top-Right pixel of code -> Color for TR shape.\n    *   Bottom-Left pixel of code -> Color for BL shape.\n    *   Bottom-Right pixel of code -> Color for BR shape.\n    *   **Test Input Mapping:**\n        *   TL (Maroon) -> **3** (Green)\n        *   TR (Grey) -> **6** (Magenta)\n        *   BL (Orange) -> **4** (Yellow)\n        *   BR (Red) -> **8** (Teal)\n4.  **Output Dimensions:**\n    *   The output width is the sum of the widths of the Top-Left shape and the Bottom-Right shape: $W = W_{TL} + W_{BR}$.\n    *   The output height is the sum of the heights of the Top-Left shape and the Top-Right shape: $H = H_{TL} + H_{TR}$.\n    *   Test Input Dimensions:\n        *   TL (Maroon): $9 \\times 8$\n        *   TR (Grey): $10 \\times 12$\n        *   BL (Orange): $3 \\times 6$\n        *   BR (Red): $6 \\times 4$\n        *   Output Width = $9 + 6 = 15$.\n        *   Output Height = $8 + 12 = 20$.\n5.  **Output Construction:**\n    *   The output is filled with a background color corresponding to the **Bottom-Right** mapped color (Color 8).\n    *   The grid is divided into zones based on the Top-Left shape's dimensions ($W_{TL}, H_{TL}$):\n        *   **TL Zone:** $(0,0)$ to $(W_{TL}-1, H_{TL}-1)$. The TL shape is drawn here in its mapped color (3).\n        *   **TR Zone:** $(W_{TL}, 0)$ to $(W-1, H_{TL}-1)$. The TR shape is drawn here in its mapped color (6), clipped if it exceeds the zone dimensions.\n        *   **BL Zone:** $(0, H_{TL})$ to $(W_{TL}-1, H-1)$. The BL shape is drawn here in its mapped color (4), clipped if necessary.\n        *   **BR Zone:** $(W_{TL}, H_{TL})$ to $(W-1, H-1)$. The BR shape is drawn here in its mapped color (8). Since the background is also 8, this shape blends in.\n\n**Step-by-Step Derivation for Test Input:**\n1.  **Canvas:** Create a $15 \\times 20$ grid filled with **8**.\n2.  **TL Shape (Color 3):**\n    *   Place the $9 \\times 8$ Maroon shape mask at $(0,0)$.\n    *   Replace non-zero pixels with **3**.\n3.  **TR Shape (Color 6):**\n    *   Target start: $(9, 0)$.\n    *   Available space: Width $15-9=6$, Height $8$.\n    *   Input TR shape is $10 \\times 12$. Clip to top-left $6 \\times 8$ part.\n    *   Replace non-zero pixels with **6**.\n4.  **BL Shape (Color 4):**\n    *   Target start: $(0, 8)$.\n    *   Available space: Width $9$, Height $20-8=12$.\n    *   Input BL shape is $3 \\times 6$. It fits completely.\n    *   Replace non-zero pixels with **4**.\n5.  **BR Shape (Color 8):**\n    *   Target start: $(9, 8)$.\n    *   Input BR shape is $6 \\times 4$.\n    *   Replace non-zero pixels with **8**. (No visible change against background).\n\n**Completed Output Grid (15x20):**\n*   **Rows 0-7 (Top Band):**\n    *   Cols 0-8: Mask of Maroon Shape (colored 3). Gaps remain 8.\n    *   Cols 9-14: Clipped Mask of Grey Shape (colored 6).\n*   **Rows 8-19 (Bottom Band):**\n    *   Cols 0-8: Mask of Orange Shape (colored 4). Only first 6 rows (8-13) and 3 cols (0-2) have content. Rest is 8.\n    *   Cols 9-14: Mask of Red Shape (colored 8). Visual result is solid 8.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6,8,8\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,8,8\n      3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,8\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,8,8\n      3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6,8,8\n      3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"7\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1. **Find the 2x2 pattern** embedded within a bordered shape (the \"pattern shape\")\n2. **Identify 4 colored shapes** in the input -

I needed to understand the relationship between input colors and the output's format, which is an 8x8 grid. The input consists of a 20x20 grid with four distinct shapes and the central clue is a small colored block within the top-left shape. The output grid's colors were directly related to that block, but in a rearranged fashion. The 8x8 size made me think of the block sizes to confirm its relationship to the output size.\n\nI proceeded to **Example 2**. The 10x10 size of its output also made me believe that it would have some direct mapping between block sizes and output size. My initial assumptions included geometric operations, like scaling, to the input grid. I confirmed the code-to-color mapping in Example 2 which led me to the idea of splitting the 20x20 input to 4 blocks of 10x10 and looking at each block to deduce their corresponding color. I saw the colored block again, as a central clue.\nI considered a few possibilities: the output grid might be a reduced-resolution version of the input, the output might represent a simplified version of the input shapes, or the output might be based on some combination of these.\n\nNext, I delved into finding the core relationship: it looked like the output grid was a scaled-down representation of the input, but the colors were derived from the *code* within the container. I began to formalize the steps: **find the container**, **extract the code**, **map the colors**. This suggested an approach based on segmentation or division into regions.\n\nI had to look into the method of transforming input shape sizes to the output sizes, and I was focusing on scaling. I examined if there was any obvious connection between the Input shapes and Output. I noticed the key was definitely the 'code' 2x2 colored block.\n\nThe core hypothesis crystallized: the output grid is a Voronoi diagram of the corners, but with the boundaries modulated by the original empty space to get the grid partitions. The idea of the output size became clear: Half the dimensions of the input shape.\n\nI took the test input and applied the approach: output size is half, find the code, determine the regions, and assign the colors. The color mapping was always related to the 2x2 color key in the container (top-left). I performed checks for scaling, gaps, and partition.\n\nFinally, the answer comes down to code-extraction and partitioning based on empty space to give the output grid. I am confident in my response.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform an input grid into an output grid based on a pattern inferred from two examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Structure:** The input grids contain four distinct colored shapes arranged roughly in the four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). The background is black (0).\n2.  **The Code:** In both examples, exactly one of the four shapes acts as a \"container\" or \"key\". This shape is not uniform; it contains a distinct 2x2 square of pixels with four different colors.\n    *   **Example 1:** The Top-Left Red (2) shape contains a 2x2 block: `1, 5` (top row), `8, 9` (bottom row).\n    *   **Example 2:** The Top-Left Magenta (6) shape contains a 2x2 block: `2, 4` (top row), `8, 3` (bottom row).\n3.  **The Output Mapping:** The output grid is a visualization of the layout of the four input shapes, but the regions are colored according to the \"Code\" found in the key shape.\n    *   The region corresponding to the Top-Left quadrant takes the Top-Left color from the code.\n    *   The region corresponding to the Top-Right quadrant takes the Top-Right color from the code.\n    *   And so on for Bottom-Left and Bottom-Right.\n4.  **Geometry and Scaling:**\n    *   The output grid represents a condensed version of the input grid. It removes the empty black space between the shapes and scales the result.\n    *   **Example 1:** Input 20x20 -> Output 8x8. (Scale factor ~0.4 or Input/2.5). The boundaries are jagged, reflecting the irregular shapes.\n    *   **Example 2:** Input 20x20 -> Output 10x10. (Scale factor 0.5). The boundaries are straight lines, reflecting the blocky/rectangular shapes.\n    *   The split lines in the output grid correspond to the relative sizes of the shape clusters in the input.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Input Grid:**\n    *   Size: 26x26.\n    *   **Shapes:**\n        *   **Top-Left:** Maroon (9) shape. This shape contains the **Code**.\n        *   **Top-Right:** Grey (5) shape. Large block.\n        *   **Bottom-Left:** Orange (7) shape. Rectangle.\n        *   **Bottom-Right:** Red (2) shape. Rectangle.\n2.  **Extract the Code:**\n    *   Locate the non-Maroon pixels inside the Top-Left Maroon shape (Rows 6-7, Cols 4-5).\n    *   Row 6: `...9, 3, 6, 9...` -> Colors are **3 (Green)** and **6 (Magenta)**.\n    *   Row 7: `...9, 4, 8, 9...` -> Colors are **4 (Yellow)** and **8 (Light Blue)**.\n    *   **Code Mapping:**\n        *   Top-Left Region -> **3**\n        *   Top-Right Region -> **6**\n        *   Bottom-Left Region -> **4**\n        *   Bottom-Right Region -> **8**\n3.  **Determine Output Geometry:**\n    *   **Size:** Following the pattern of Example 2 (clean rectangular shapes -> scale by 0.5), the input size 26x26 maps to **13x13**.\n    *   **Partitions:** Determine where to split the 13x13 grid based on the gaps in the input.\n        *   **Horizontal Split (Top vs Bottom):**\n            *   Top shapes end at row 17. Bottom shapes start at row 19. The gap is at row 18.\n            *   Relative split position: 18 / 26 $\\approx$ 0.69.\n            *   In the 13-row output: $13 \\times 0.69 \\approx 9$.\n            *   **Top Region Height:** 9 rows.\n            *   **Bottom Region Height:** 4 rows (13 - 9).\n        *   **Vertical Split (Left vs Right):**\n            *   Left shapes end at col 9. Right shapes start at col 17. The center of the gap is roughly col 13.\n            *   Relative split position: 13 / 26 = 0.5.\n            *   In the 13-column output: $13 \\times 0.5 = 6.5$.\n            *   Based on pixel mass (Left width 7 vs Right width 6), we give the Left side 7 columns.\n            *   **Left Region Width:** 7 columns.\n            *   **Right Region Width:** 6 columns.\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid:**\n*   Dimensions: 13x13.\n*   **Rows 0-8 (Top):**\n    *   Cols 0-6 (Left): Color **3**\n    *   Cols 7-12 (Right): Color **6**\n*   **Rows 9-12 (Bottom):**\n    *   Cols 0-6 (Left): Color **4**\n    *   Cols 7-12 (Right): Color **8**\n\n**Output Grid:**\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_11_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**My Analysis of the ARC Task**\n\nThe user has given me an ARC task that requires inferring a transformation based on example inputs and applying it to a new test input. The task involves grids of integers (0-9). My goal is to figure out the transformation rules, test it against the examples, and then apply it to the test case. The user has provided \"Object Descriptions\" and a \"Transformation Description\", hinting at how to approach this problem.\n\nThe provided transformation logic is as follows:\n1.  Identify a composite object with two internal contrasting colors, extract those colors (P00, P01, P10, P11).\n2.  Find four main colored objects in the grid and assign them to quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n3.  Recolor those four objects using the extracted internal colors.\n4.  Use a region growing or \"Voronoi\" algorithm to fill in the zeros, assigning them the color of the nearest object.\n5.  Crop/pad to a square region and downsample (typically by a factor of 2) to get the smaller output.\n\nI'll now need to verify this logic on the examples.\n\n**Verification on Example 1**\n\nIn the Example 1 input (20x20), I find the following:\n*   A \"composite object\" in the top-left area. It is a red shape, with a 2x2 pattern inside. The colors are Blue (1), Gray (5), Teal (8) and Maroon (9).\n*   The quadrant colors are mapped to the four colors as: P00 = Blue (1) at Top-Left, P01 = Gray (5) at Top-Right, P10 = Teal (8) at Bottom-Left, P11 = Maroon (9) at Bottom-Right.\n\nBy recoloring and \"growing\" the output, I see that the output is not 10x10. The output is 8x8. The \"downsampling\" isn't a simple factor 2. Looking at the boundary of the shape, I now think it's cropping a portion of the grid and mapping that to an output that makes sense given the dimensions of the internal blocks. It must be something like \"determine the bounding box of the non-zero cells and then resize to a multiple of 2\".\n\n**Verification on Example 2**\nInput (20x20), Output (10x10)\nI again identify the composite shape, extract its 2x2 internal pattern. P00 = Red (2), P01=Yellow (4), P10=Teal (8), P11=Green (3). I then identify the objects in the quadrants.\nHowever, I can see from this example, the resulting bounding box may not result in a 2x2 scaling. A 18x18 input grid will then pad to a 20x20, and then will translate that to a 10x10 output.\n\n**Processing of Test Input**\nNow I have to look at the new test input (26x26).\n1.  I identify the composite object. It's Maroon (9) at Top-Left, with an internal palette of 3(Green), 6(Magenta), 4(Yellow) and 8(Teal).\n    *   3(Green) is P00 and will map to the TL object\n    *   6(Magenta) is P01 and will map to the TR object\n    *   4(Yellow) is P10 and will map to the BL object\n    *   8(Teal) is P11 and will map to the BR object\n2.  I Identify the objects as:\n    *   TL is Maroon, with the internal palette\n    *   TR is Gray\n    *   BL is Orange\n    *   BR is Red\n3.  I have identified the regions to assign those colors to.\n    *   Maroon (TL), Gray(TR), Orange(BL) and Red (BR)\n4.  I determined the resulting scale and output size.\n    *   If I follow the pattern of padding to a even number, and downscaling by 2, and the objects in the Test Input cover an area, and the grid has a size of 26.\n    *   The total content width is 23 (3 to 25)\n    *   The total content height is 21 (4 to 24)\n    *   If I had to make the grid an even size, I could make it 24 to get a scaling of 12. Since there is already a 2x2\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow the transformation logic derived from the provided examples and the description.\n\n### Analysis of the Request and Examples\n\n1.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   **Identify Composite Object:** Locate the shape containing internal contrasting pixels (the \"palette\").\n    *   **Extract Palette:** Read the 2x2 block of internal pixels $(P_{00}, P_{01}, P_{10}, P_{11})$.\n    *   **Identify Quadrants:** Locate the 4 main solid color masses in the grid (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). One of these is the composite object itself.\n    *   **Assign Colors:** Map the palette colors to the quadrants: $P_{00} \\to TL$, $P_{01} \\to TR$, $P_{10} \\to BL$, $P_{11} \\to BR$.\n    *   **Construct Output:** Create a downsampled grid (factor 2) where the regions corresponding to the quadrants are filled with the assigned colors. The split lines for the regions are determined by the spatial gaps between the objects in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Test Input:**\n    *   **Grid Size:** 26x26.\n    *   **Objects Identification:**\n        *   **Top-Left (TL):** A Maroon (9) shape.

It's all about analyzing the connections between these input grids, and the output we're supposed to create. I'm focusing on trying to figure out the rule that connects the two.\n\nAlright, in Example 1, I see this big grid with all these colored shapes. The key is in this red shape, kinda like a frame, that has these inner pixels of different colors. The output is a smaller grid, and it looks like it's built from colored regions, not just the original shapes. It's not a straight-up mapping, the output is a kind of tiling. This makes me think the \"color map\" is embedded in that red frame. The arrangement of those colors inside the frame determines the arrangement of the regions in the output. The other shapes, the orange, yellow and green, they define the shapes of the output regions. The red shape has 1, 5, 8, and 9 and the colors seem to match. Okay, this \"topology\" comes from the red piece containing the inner pixels and other shapes define the layout.\n\nExample 2 reinforces this. The \"color map\" is inside a pink frame, and the colors are arranged according to the output.\n\nSo, the rule so far is: Look at the small colors that live inside the red/pink frame, the other shapes get assigned colors from that map (in order of position). Those colors and their positions determine the order of outputs and the general arrangement of shapes inside them.\n\nNow, let's look at the Test Input. This is where it gets interesting. I see maroon, grey, orange, and red shapes, and the \"color map\" is inside the maroon shape this time. The tricky part is the \"puzzle\" nature, where the shapes fit together into a rectangle (likely a 12x12).\n\nHere\u2019s my thought process: The output arrangement is related to some property about the input pieces. Is it a ranking? The number of pixels? Size? I have to consider the arrangement of colors in the outputs from previous examples, and how they relate to the size of shapes. The biggest hint is that 8 always relates to smallest. Now, I have to figure out a clear mapping strategy.\n\nIn the Test Input, since the map is embedded in the maroon, I'm ranking and assigning values relative to that. In the test input, I've got my shapes: maroon (with the map), grey, orange, and red.  The final output's structure is determined from the input. I\u2019ve gone through the puzzle elements to make sure that each is considered.\n\nI now need to construct a reasonable final output, that incorporates all the logic I've discovered: The map\u2019s color values tell the output colors. I know the \u201c8\u201d (small value) relates to the smallest area shape, etc. This is the output I constructed with the shapes, in the correct locations based on the principles I've established.\n\nTo solve this task, I analyzed the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grids contain several colored shapes (connected components) on a black background.\n    *   One of these shapes acts as a \"Frame\" or \"Map Holder\". It is distinguished by containing a 2x2 block of different colored pixels inside it.\n    *   The other shapes are solid blocks of color.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Map:** The \"Map\" inside the Frame consists of 4 pixels arranged in a 2x2 square.\n    *   The position of each pixel in the 2x2 map corresponds to a quadrant in the *Output* grid (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n    *   The *color* of the pixel in the map dictates the color of the region in that quadrant of the Output.\n\n3.  **Map Logic & Sorting:**\n    *   I determined which input shape corresponds to which output region by analyzing the pixel counts (area) of the shapes.\n    *   **Rule:** The input shapes (including the Frame shape itself) are ranked by their area (size).\n        *   Rank 1: Smallest area.\n        *   Rank 2: 2nd smallest.\n        *   Rank 3: 3rd smallest.\n        *   Rank 4: Largest area.\n    *   The destination of these pieces is determined by the **Map Values** and their **Positions**:\n        *   The **Map Value 8** always corresponds to the **Smallest Piece (Rank 1)**. The position of '8' in the map tells us which Output Quadrant gets the smallest piece.\n        *   The **Map Position TR (Top-Right)** always receives the **2nd Smallest Piece (Rank 2)**.\n        *   The **Map Holder Shape** (the one containing the map) always goes to the **Output TL (Top-Left)** quadrant. Its rank determines which rank goes to TL (e.g., in the Test Input, the holder is Rank 3).\n        *   The remaining piece goes to the remaining quadrant (Output BL).\n\n4.  **Applying to Test Input:**\n    *   **Input Shapes & Sizes:**\n        *   **Maroon (Top-Left area):** Area ~50 pixels. Contains the Map. -> **Rank 3**.\n        *   **Grey (Bottom/Mid-Right area):** Area ~62 pixels. -> **Rank 4 (Largest)**.\n        *   **Red (Bottom-Right area):** Area ~18 pixels. -> **Rank 2**.\n        *   **Orange (Bottom-Left area):** Area 12 pixels. -> **Rank 1 (Smallest)**.\n    *   **Map Extraction:** Found inside the Maroon shape.\n        *   `3 6` (Top row)\n        *   `4 8` (Bottom row)\n        *   TL=3, TR=6, BL=4, BR=8.\n    *   **Assignments:**\n        1.  **Map Holder (Maroon, Rank 3)** goes to **Output TL**. Map color at TL is **3**.\n        2.  **Smallest Piece (Orange, Rank 1)** goes to the position of '8' in the Map. '8' is at **Output BR**. Map color is **8**.\n        3.  **2nd Smallest Piece (Red, Rank 2)** goes to **Output TR** (Standard Rule). Map color at TR is **6**.\n        4.  **Largest Piece (Grey, Rank 4)** goes to the remaining **Output BL**. Map color at BL is **4**.\n\n5.  **Construction:**\n    *   Output Size: Estimated to be 12x12 based on total pixel area (~142).\n    *   **Top-Left Region:** Color 3 (Maroon shape).\n    *   **Top-Right Region:** Color 6 (Red shape).\n    *   **Bottom-Left Region:** Color 4 (Grey shape).\n    *   **Bottom-Right Region:** Color 8 (Orange shape).\n    *   The large pieces (Maroon, Grey) are on the Left. The small pieces (Red, Orange) are on the Right.\n    *   Vertical split roughly at column 9 (9 cols left, 3 cols right).\n    *   Horizontal split roughly at row 6.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"12\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_4_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this ARC task, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1. **Key Structure**: In each input, one shape contains a 2\u00d72 grid of 4 different colors (the \"key\").

It wants me to transform a large grid into a smaller one, based on two examples and a test input.  My initial thought is to break down the task into smaller steps and look for a pattern, since this seems to be a classic ARC approach.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the inputs and outputs.  The input is a grid full of colored shapes, and the output is a smaller grid with a specific pattern. The examples are vital here: they're 20x20 input grids with outputs that are 8x8 and 10x10. The test input is 26x26.  I need to figure out what's happening.\n\nI'm given a \u201cTransformation Description.\u201d My job is to see if it works with the examples. It describes a sequence: 1) Find a \u201ccomposite object\u201d with a specific 2x2 color pattern,  2) Identify 4 main solid shapes, 3) Recolor these shapes using the pattern, 4) Fill remaining grid space by expanding the shape boundaries via Voronoi or Manhattan, 5) Crop and downsample. This seems a promising starting point.\n\nI start by testing this on Example 1. The input is a 20x20 grid, and I spot this red shape with internal pixels: 1, 5, 8, 9, arranged in a 2x2.  Other shapes are also present. The output is an 8x8 grid. It has the colors 1, 5, 8, 9, which matches the 2x2 color pattern from the red shape. Each color from the 2x2 corresponds to a region in the output grid, in the same quadrant as the shapes.\n\nEssentially, the transformation seems to be: find a 2x2 pattern inside the input, map this 2x2 pattern to the four main shape quadrants, expand shapes, and downsample. The 0-cells fill by expanding boundaries until they meet. The final output is just a scaling down, but the color assignments and boundaries are crucial.  The downsampling isn't an integer factor, but that's okay. The shape and placement information is preserved. I get it.\n\nNow, on to Example 2. It also has a 20x20 input. This time the \"code\" is located at the center, not at the top-left like in Example 1. This one is more complex, but I identify four quadrants, find the 2x2 pattern (2,4,8,3), and map each object to a color in the output. The output, a 10x10 grid, shows the same transformation pattern, but the 2x2 pattern is now the middle-left instead of the Top-Left as in the first example.  This reinforces that the spatial relationships of the shapes are important, as well as the 2x2.\n\nThe key is that the grid is downsampled by a factor of 2. The code pixel group is contained within a larger object which serves to define the locations of the 4 quadrants. Each quadrant's original color gets transformed into a pixel from the code. The non-object cells are filled by expanding until the object shapes overlap. This isn't just cropping. It's a shape-preserving resize.\n\nWith my refined understanding of the pattern, I'm ready to tackle the test input. The new input is a 26x26 grid, so the output will be 13x13. First, I identify the objects. I find the \u201ccode\u201d object. Inside, a 2x2 pixel grid (3,6,4,8) is located. Then, I define the relative spatial positions of the other objects around this code, in order to perform the color mapping. I see a maroon shape with the code inside, a grey blob to the top-right, an orange rectangle to the bottom-left, and a red rectangle to the bottom-right. Based on the examples, I know how the quadrants are now assigned to the color code. It is: top-left (maroon) -> 3, top-right (grey) -> 6, bottom-left (orange) -> 4, bottom-right (red) -> 8.\n\nNext, I need to figure out the output grid. For this I need to follow the rules from the example. I need to generate an output. Downsample the input by a factor of 2, then fill the gaps based on the nearest neighbor.\n\nFor the output grid, I scan through, mapping the 2x2 blocks of the input to pixels. If it hits an object's color, use the mapped color. If it's zero,\n\nTo solve the problem, we first analyze the transformation logic based on the provided description and examples.\n\n1.  **Identify Objects and Palette:**\n    - We scan the input grid to identify the \"composite object\" that contains the 2x2 palette.\n    - In the **Test Input**, the Maroon shape (9) in the top-left quadrant (Rows 4-11, Cols 3-12) contains a 2x2 block of distinct colors at `(Row 5, Col 4)`.\n    - The palette pixels are:\n        - `(5,4)`: 3 (Green)\n        - `(5,5)`: 6 (Magenta)\n        - `(6,4)`: 4 (Yellow)\n        - `(6,5)`: 8 (Teal)\n    - This gives us the mapping based on quadrants:\n        - Top-Left Object -> 3\n        - Top-Right Object -> 6\n        - Bottom-Left Object -> 4\n        - Bottom-Right Object -> 8\n\n2.  **Identify Main Solid Objects and Assign Colors:**\n    - **Top-Left (TL):** Maroon (9) object. Maps to **3**.\n    - **Top-Right (TR):** Grey (5) object. Maps to **6**.\n    - **Bottom-Left (BL):** Orange (7) object. Maps to **4**.\n    - **Bottom-Right (BR):** Red (2) object. Maps to **8**.\n\n3.  **Transformation (Downsampling & Growth):**\n    - The input grid is 26x26. The description and examples imply a downsampling by a factor of 2, resulting in a **13x13** output grid.\n    - We map each 2x2 block in the input to 1 pixel in the output.\n    - If a block contains pixels of an object, the output takes that object's mapped color.\n    - Empty space is filled based on the Manhattan distance to the nearest object (Voronoi tessellation).\n\n4.  **Constructing the Output Grid:**\n    - **Top Section (Rows 0-7):**\n        - Corresponds to Input Rows 0-15.\n        - Left side is dominated by the TL Object (9 -> 3).\n        - Right side is dominated by the TR Object (5 -> 6).\n        - The TL object (width ~10) is wider than the TR object in the upper section, or rather the \"gap\" falls such that the boundary is at Output Column 7. However, calculating the distances for the \"gap\" columns (Input 12-15), Input 12-13 is closer to TL, and Input 14-15 is closer to TR.\n        - Output Cols 0-6 (7 pixels) -> **3**.\n        - Output Cols 7-12 (6 pixels) -> **6**.\n    - **Transition Row (Row 8):**\n        - Corresponds to Input Rows 16-17.\n        - Left side is empty (Gap above BL object). Right side contains the tail of TR object (5).\n        - Calculating distances for the empty space: The boundary between BL (4) and TR (6) shifts left because the TR object is present in this row while BL is not (BL starts Row 19).\n        - Detailed check places the boundary after Column 4.\n        - Output Cols 0-4 (5 pixels) -> **4**.\n        - Output Cols 5-12 (8 pixels) -> **6**.\n    - **Bottom Section (Rows 9-12):**\n        - Corresponds to Input Rows 18-25.\n        - Left side contains BL Object (7 -> 4).\n        - Right side contains BR Object (2 -> 8).\n        - The BL object is narrow (Cols 3-5).

My initial thought process involves breaking down the input into recognizable objects and identifying how their colors and positions are related to the output.\n\n**First, I see several distinct shapes with different colors in the input. A special \"key\" shape, defined by a distinct \"noise\" pattern of colors, seems crucial for determining the output's structure. I hypothesize that the color distribution within this key shape acts as a color map. Based on the arrangement of color values (1,5,8,9) inside the 'Red' shape, I believe these correspond to the quadrants of the output.** I start to meticulously examine the coordinates of these \"noise pixels\" relative to the other shapes, trying to see if there's a spatial mapping.\n\n**Next, I analyze the \"geometric shapes\" of the input objects and output image by calculating their pixel sizes.** After careful examination, I hypothesize that the output could be a composition of the input shapes. I also explore the possibility of Transposing or rotating the inputs during this process, since the size and position of the output and input seemed to differ.\n\n**I started to wonder if these colors map to each quadrant of the output grid. For Example 1, I find a correlation between the colors within the \"key\" shape and the color distribution of the final image.** With deeper analysis, I confirm that each distinct color in the key shape (1,5,8,9) does correspond to a separate quadrant of the output image, and these colors determine the quadrant colors. However, now I have to figure out the geometrical transformation applied to the objects. I explore whether the input shapes are simply translated and recolored, or if they undergo Transpose or Rotation transformations before being placed in the output.\n\n**Ultimately, I think it's a combination of transposition, overlaying, and recoloring. Each quadrant is constructed by Transposing and pasting the original input shape onto the final grid. With that I came up with what I consider my working Hypothesis: The Output is a composition of transposed shapes based on the input shapes and the key from Example 1.**\n\n**Now, I think I have a general approach that would apply to solve the task.**\n\n\nThe solution involves decomposing the input grid into four distinct \"Source Shapes\" and a \"Key\" map, then transforming and assembling them into the output grid.\n\n**1. Decomposition and Mapping:**\n- The input contains four distinct shapes made of specific colors. In the test input, these are:\n    - **TL:** Maroon (9) shape.\n    - **TR:** Grey (5) shape.\n    - **BL:** Orange (7) shape.\n    - **BR:** Red (2) shape.\n- One of these shapes contains a \"Key\" consisting of single pixels of four colors arranged in a 2x2 pattern. In the test input, the Key is inside the Maroon (9) shape:\n    - `3` (Green) at Top-Left.\n    - `6` (Magenta) at Top-Right.\n    - `4` (Yellow) at Bottom-Left.\n    - `8` (Teal) at Bottom-Right.\n- This Key defines the target colors for the four input shapes based on their quadrant position:\n    - TL Input Shape (Maroon) $\\rightarrow$ Target Color **3** (Green).\n    - TR Input Shape (Grey) $\\rightarrow$ Target Color **6** (Magenta).\n    - BL Input Shape (Orange) $\\rightarrow$ Target Color **4** (Yellow).\n    - BR Input Shape (Red) $\\rightarrow$ Target Color **8** (Teal).\n\n**2. Transformation (Transpose):**\n- Each source shape is extracted (ignoring holes filled with key noise) and **transposed** (rows become columns).\n    - **Green Shape (from Maroon):** Input dimensions $\\approx$ 8x10 (HxW). Transposed $\\rightarrow$ 10x8. Solid block on left, thinning to the right (holes in original bottom rows).\n    - **Magenta Shape (from Grey):** Input dimensions $\\approx$ 12x10 (HxW). Transposed $\\rightarrow$ 10x12 (approx). Thin on left, thick on right.\n    - **Yellow Shape (from Orange):** Input is a 6x3 L-shape. Transposed $\\rightarrow$ 3x6 L-shape (rotated).\n    - **Teal Shape (from Red):** Input is a 4x6 triangle. Transposed $\\rightarrow$ 6x4 triangle.\n\n**3. Assembly:**\n- The output grid dimensions are determined by the sum of the widths of the top transposed shapes and the maximum height.\n    - Width = Width(Green) + Width(Magenta) = $8 + 10 = 18$.\n    - Height = Max(Height(Green), Height(Magenta)) = $10$.\n- The grid is split into a Left Panel (cols 0-7) and a Right Panel (cols 8-17).\n- **Left Panel:**\n    - **Top Layer:** Green Shape aligned Top-Left.\n    - **Bottom Layer:** Yellow Shape aligned Bottom-Left. The Green shape overlays the Yellow shape. Where Green has holes (0s), Yellow is visible.\n- **Right Panel:**\n    - **Top Layer:** Magenta Shape aligned Top-Left (of the panel).\n    - **Bottom Layer:** Teal Shape aligned Bottom-Right. Magenta overlays Teal. Since Magenta is dense on the right side, it mostly covers the Teal triangle.\n\n**Generated Output Grid (10x18):**\n- **Rows 0-6:** Left side is solid Green (3). Right side starts with 0s then solid Magenta (6).\n- **Row 7:** Green has a hole at col 5, revealing Yellow (4). Magenta is solid.\n- **Row 8:** Green is solid left, empty right. Yellow is visible? (Yellow shape logic implies distinct visibility).\n- **Row 9:** Green shape ends, Yellow visible at col 2.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6,6,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"20\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_5_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nOkay, here's my understanding of the situation and the planned solution. The user wants me to solve an ARC task, but there's a bit of a wrinkle in the instructions. The prompt emphasizes *only* revealing the final output grid and not any internal reasoning. However, it also *asks* for a detailed explanation. This seems contradictory, but I'm going to interpret it as a request for a high-level summary of my logic rather than a line-by-line breakdown. The important thing is to give the user enough insight to understand *how* the solution was derived without exposing the raw internal \"scratchpad\" work.\n\nEssentially, I'm to solve the puzzle, explain how I figured it out in a way that someone could reconstruct my steps, and then provide the final output grid. That's the core request, and I should ignore the \"fluff\" about a \"protocol override\" or \"hidden scratchpad.\" Now, I need to analyze the specific task given. It's about recognizing patterns and relationships between example inputs and outputs, and applying them to a new test input to solve it.\n\nThe overall approach seems to involve identifying a \"container\" object with a specific pattern inside. This pattern serves as a \"kernel\" or base for the final output. The positions and shapes of other objects in the input then determine the shapes and positions of regions in the final output grid. The output is a collage of these objects or regions, but colored with the kernel's colors.\n\n**Here's the planned approach:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Example Inputs:** I'll carefully examine the two example inputs to identify the \"container\" object (the one with the distinctive 2x2 internal pattern) and extract the kernel colors and relative positions of those colors. Also, I need to carefully study the \"mask\" shapes of the various objects in the grids.\n2.  **Object Classification:** I will categorize the objects based on their spatial positions (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) within the input grid.\n3.  **Output Grid Construction:**  The logic seems that each object in the input corresponds to a region in the output and is colored by one of the \"kernel\" colors. The shape of each output region is derived from its matching object shape in the input, but these objects overlap. The overall size of the output is a little unclear but likely related to the object dimensions, and I need to figure this out with the examples. The challenge will be precisely placing these objects, given that the instructions seem to indicate they may overlap in some way.\n4.  **Test Input Application:** Finally, I'll apply the identified pattern and logic to solve the test input.\n\nI'm making a key assumption here: While the prompt asks for an explanation, my final output will *only* be the grid. The explanation is something I'll write separately, as a summary of my reasoning. That's what I will produce now.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we identify a \"container\" object in the input grid that encloses a distinctive 2x2 pattern of colors. We then extract this kernel of 4 colors and map them to the four quadrants of the output grid. The shapes in the output grid are derived from the four distinct objects found in the input, scaled and arranged to form a collage.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Input and Extract the Kernel**\n- In the Test Input, the \"Container\" object is the Maroon (9) shape in the top-left region.\n- Inside this Maroon container (rows 5-6, cols 4-5 approx), we find a 2x2 set of colors:\n  - Top-Left: Green (3)\n  - Top-Right: Pink (6)\n  - Bottom-Left: Yellow (4)\n  - Bottom-Right: Teal (8)\n- This gives us our color mapping for the output quadrants:\n  - TL Region -> 3\n  - TR Region -> 6\n  - BL Region -> 4\n  - BR Region -> 8 (and Background)\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Four Objects and their Shapes**\nWe identify the four main objects in the input grid and assign them to quadrants based on their position:\n1.  **TL Object (Maroon 9):** A 9x8 block (width 9, height 8). This maps to the TL region (Color 3).\n2.  **TR Object (Gray 5):** A pyramid-like shape, width 10, height 12. Maps to the TR region (Color 6).\n3.  **BL Object (Orange 7):** A 3x6 block. Maps to the BL region (Color 4).\n4.  **BR Object (Red 2):** A 6x4 block. Maps to the BR region (Color 8).\n\n**Step 3: Determine Output Dimensions and Layout**\n- Based on the solved examples, the output width is the sum of the TL and TR object widths minus 1 (overlap).\n  - Test Width = 9 (TL) + 10 (TR) - 1 = 18.\n- The output grids in the examples are square. Following this pattern, we set the output height to 18.\n- We construct the output by placing the object shapes in their respective corners of the 18x18 grid.\n  - **TL (Color 3):** Placed at (0,0). Size 9x8.\n  - **TR (Color 6):** Placed at Top-Right. Its shape is a pyramid growing from width 3 to 10. It contains some holes near the bottom.\n  - **BL (Color 4):** Placed at Bottom-Left. Size 3x6.\n  - **BR (Color 8):** Placed at Bottom-Right. Since the background color (from the kernel's bottom-right) is also 8, this shape merges with the background.\n\n**Step 4: Construct the Grid**\n- Fill the 18x18 grid with the background color (8).\n- Draw the TL shape (Color 3) in the top-left 9x8 area.\n- Draw the TR shape (Color 6) in the top-right area (rows 0-11, cols 8-17). We reproduce the \"pyramid\" growth and the holes found in the input object.\n- Draw the BL shape (Color 4) in the bottom-left area (rows 12-17, cols 0-2).\n- The gaps remain filled with the background color (8).\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nThe resulting grid combines these elements, respecting the overlaps and geometry of the original objects.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"21\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this task, I need to identify the pattern from the examples:\n\n**Key observations from examples:**\n1.

The user wants me to solve this ARC problem. It looks like a Voronoi-type problem, but with some clever color mapping and resizing. I've got two examples and a test input to work from. Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, I looked at the examples. The input is a 20x20 grid with these colored shapes, and the output is a smaller grid with different colors and a specific region structure. The hints say \"Manhattan-distance multi-source expansion\", which screams Voronoi. But the output size is a key puzzle. Initial thoughts are maybe the output is just cropped or a rescaled representation.\n\nExample 1 is 20x20 to 8x8 and example 2 is 20x20 to 10x10. That output size variance has to be from the input, maybe. Is it the number of pixels in the active region? I looked for markers or a crop region, but the hints pointed me back to the shapes' layout.\n\nA key observation here is the mapping of colors, it seems related to the position of the shapes. Inside of one of the shapes (the Key Shape), there were *intruder* colors. Those intruder colors seem to define the output color of the corresponding regions. It looks like it is 2x2 blocks that define the output.\n\nAnalyzing the hints, \"Manhattan-distance multi-source expansion\" confirms Voronoi. Hint 4 says each output region gets a single color, which means color remapping, not direct mapping. But what grid is the expansion on? Since the size differs for the same input, the hint makes me guess that maybe the input dictates the output dimensions. Maybe Voronoi is performed on the *original input grid*, but then it gets downsampled somehow?\n\nI looked at the colors in the key shape and the intruder pixels inside the blocks and compared them with the output to find a pattern. I was able to find a pattern! The intruder pixels of one of the shapes are related to the output colors. It's a 2x2 intruder region (key) that dictates output colors. The location of pixels within that region determines colors of corresponding output regions.\n\nNow, how to determine the output size? The shapes give the dimensions. I calculated bounding boxes, distances between shapes, and empty spaces. Nothing. Maybe active area? Maybe it's encoded inside the Key shape? No. Finally, I noticed the outputs are always smaller than the original input dimensions. It feels like the solution lies with the active portion of the Voronoi diagrams.\n\nLet's look more closely at the examples. The size has to be derived from the input's geometry, as it changes. Maybe the empty areas define the dimensions? The 20x20 input maps to smaller values. Is the output grid just a *crop* from the full Voronoi diagram on the original grid? Then it dawned on me to look at the boundaries of the output. I can see the \"cross\" structure (boundaries between the regions, Voronoi). Now I need to know the crop box, and what is its dimension.\n\nSo the Output is Voronoi on the full input grid, and some part of it is shown in the output, and is cropped or rescaled? I needed to determine the correct size for the output. So I will see if there is a pattern to the size. The output size is probably some derivation of the input bounding box. Maybe a scale or divider. It is probably related to an active range of rows and columns. In the examples, the shapes use different amount of space. This makes me suspect that that range has to be used to map the value to an output dimension. The key to the solution is likely: use Voronoi on the *full input grid* and then extract the output. Now I had to find how the extraction is defined. The tricky part is the *output grid size*.\n\nI looked at the distances between shapes and at the size of the key pattern. No joy. Okay, let's go back to the cropping. It's Voronoi, right, so it's a grid based on the \"seeds.\" I looked at the bounding boxes for the shapes and how the key and all that relates. But I saw that the 20x20 to 8x8 mapping doesn't seem to work, or rather doesn't have a clear ratio. Maybe it is the area that is completely covered with the Voronoi, with the boundaries only? That defines the active range. Now I see that I can map the bounds of the active ranges to a number of blocks, using blocks 2x2 in size. I realized to find this pattern that I need to look for that pattern in both examples, and test on\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing four distinct colored shapes into a smaller grid partitioned into four regions. By analyzing the solved examples, we can deduce the following rules:\n\n1.  **Identify Seed Shapes**: The input grid contains four separate groups of colored pixels. These act as \"seeds\" for a Voronoi-like partition of the space.\n    *   Example 1 shapes: Red (Top-Left), Orange (Top-Right), Yellow (Bottom-Left), Green (Bottom-Right).\n    *   Example 2 shapes: Magenta (TL), Gray (TR), Maroon (BL), Blue (BR).\n    *   Test Input shapes: Maroon (TL), Gray (TR), Orange (BL), Red (BR).\n\n2.  **Determine Output Colors (The \"Key\")**:\n    *   One of the four shapes contains a distinct $2 \\times 2$ block of \"intruder\" pixels that are different from the main shape's color. This block acts as a color key for the output regions.\n    *   The position of the pixels in this $2 \\times 2$ key corresponds to the four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right) of the output grid.\n    *   **Example 1**: The Red shape (TL) contains the key `1 5 / 8 9`.\n        *   TL region becomes Blue (1).\n        *   TR region becomes Gray (5).\n        *   BL region becomes Teal (8).\n        *   BR region becomes Maroon (9).\n    *   **Example 2**: The Magenta shape (TL) contains the key `2 4 / 8 3`.\n        *   TL region becomes Red (2).\n        *   TR region becomes Yellow (4).\n        *   BL region becomes Teal (8).\n        *   BR region becomes Green (3).\n    *   **Test Input**: The Maroon shape (TL) contains the key `3 6 / 4 8` (found in rows 5-6, cols 4-5 relative to the grid).\n        *   **TL region -> Green (3)**\n        *   **TR region -> Magenta (6)**\n        *   **BL region -> Yellow (4)**\n        *   **BR region -> Teal (8)**\n\n3.  **Determine Output Grid Size**:\n    *   The output grid represents a downsampled version of the active area of the input grid. Specifically, the input grid is divided into $2 \\times 2$ blocks.\n    *   The dimensions are determined by the span of blocks containing any part of the four shapes.\n    *   **Test Input Analysis**:\n        *   Rows containing shapes: 4 to 24 (0-indexed).\n            *   Min Block Row: $\\lfloor 4/2 \\rfloor = 2$.\n            *   Max Block Row: $\\lfloor 24/2 \\rfloor = 12$.\n            *   Height in blocks: $12 - 2 + 1 = 11$.\n        *   Cols containing shapes: 3 to 25.\n            *   Min Block Col: $\\lfloor 3/2 \\rfloor = 1$.\n            *   Max Block Col: $\\lfloor 25/2 \\rfloor = 12$.\n            *   Width in blocks: $12 - 1 + 1 = 12$.\n    *   The output grid will be **12 columns wide and 11 rows high**.\n\n4.  **Fill the Grid (Voronoi Expansion)**:\n    *   Each cell in the output grid corresponds to a $2 \\times 2$ block in the input.\n    *   We determine the color of each output cell by calculating the Manhattan distance from the center of its corresponding input block to the nearest pixel of any of the four seed shapes.\n    *   The cell is assigned the mapped color of the closest shape.\n\n**Applying to Test Input**:\n*   **Top-Left (Maroon)**: Becomes **3**.\n*   **Top-Right (Gray)**: Becomes **6**.\n*   **Bottom-Left (Orange)**: Becomes **4**.\n*   **Bottom-Right (Red)**: Becomes **8**.\n*   We perform the distance check for each of the $12 \\times 11$ cells.\n    *   Cells closer to the top-left Maroon shape become 3.\n    *   Cells closer to the top-right Gray shape become 6.\n    *   Cells closer to the bottom-left Orange shape become 4.\n    *   Cells closer to the bottom-right Red shape become 8.\n*   The boundaries will be stair-stepped, meeting roughly in the center of the open space between the groups.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,6,6,6\n      4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,6,6,6\n      4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"25\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Comprehensive Analysis and Solution for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The task is to analyze two solved examples, then solve a new one. I need to figure out the pattern relating input and output, particularly how to map the colors and the output grid size.\n\nFirst, I examine the examples. In Example 1, I see four distinct groups of colors, one containing a 2x2 \"key\" pattern. The output seems to divide space based on these groups, using colors from the key. The output size is smaller (8x8) than the input (20x20). I check Example 2 for confirmation. Again, four groups, with a key. The output is 10x10. The regions in the output match the key's positions: Top-Left maps to the Top-Left key color, Top-Right maps to Top-Right, and so on.\n\nThe hint about \"Voronoi-like territory assignment\" clicks.  The input groups act as seeds. The space is being partitioned into regions, which are then colored according to a hidden 2x2 key within *one* of the input groups. The regions are stair-stepped, which matches Manhattan distance. This means I'm supposed to find the 2x2 key within an input group, map it to quadrant positions, and generate a Voronoi diagram (using Manhattan distance) on the input, then color each region appropriately.\n\nBut why the size change? In both examples, the outputs are smaller. Maybe the prompt is using cropped examples. The prompt is also explicit about the output sizes (8x8, 10x10). Is the output size fixed, or related to the input somehow? The bounding box of the non-black pixels? No simple linear scaling.  It's not the key dimensions either. I'll note that the input and output sizes are *different*.\n\nI then analyze the test input. It's 26x26. I find the four groups and the hidden key: [[3, 6], [4, 8]]. Quadrant mapping is: Group 9 (TL) -> Key TL (3), Group 5 (TR) -> Key TR (6), Group 7 (BL) -> Key BL (4), Group 2 (BR) -> Key BR (8). So the output colors are 3, 6, 4, and 8 for the four quadrants respectively.\n\nI hypothesize that output size should match input size, (26x26).  The examples are truncated! I'll note this assumption. I'm going to proceed to generate a 26x26 grid, since the prompt states \"fill the grid\". The hint about \"completely fill the grid\" makes me think that's it!\n\n**Algorithm**: I identified the groups (the connected components). I located the 2x2 keys in a group. I classified the groups by quadrant (TL, TR, BL, BR) based on their centroids. I mapped the key colors to the quadrants.\n\nFor the output generation, I'll calculate the Voronoi regions using Manhattan distance. I will output a full 26x26 grid (since no obvious size logic emerged), filling the grid with the colors 3, 6, 4, 8 for each respective quadrant, based on the *relative position* of the input groups.\n\n*Refining the Process: I am simulating the Voronoi pattern in my mind, since I cannot run code.*\n\nMy \"final grid plan\" creates the 26x26 output using these steps:\n  - Row 0..15:\n    - Cols 0..15: Color 3.\n    - Cols 16..25: Color 6.\n  - Row 16..25:\n    - Cols 0..11: Color 4.\n    - Cols 12..25: Color 8.\n\nThe shift in the vertical line (from x=15 to x=11) creates the stair step, as expected. I am confident! The colors and the positions are all correct, and the \"stair-stepped\" property is satisfied.\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task based on two examples and a test input.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal**: The inputs consist of four separated \"foreground\" groups of colored pixels on a black background. The outputs are grids fully filled with four connected regions of solid color. The task is to partition the grid into four regions based on the input groups and color them according to a specific logic.\n\n2.  **Determine the Partitioning (Geometry)**:\n    *   The hints and visual inspection of the examples suggest a **Voronoi-like partition** using Manhattan distance.\n    *   This means each pixel in the output grid is assigned to the \"nearest\" input group.\n    *   The \"seeds\" for the Voronoi regions are the entire shapes of the input groups.\n    *   Boundaries are formed where pixels are equidistant from two groups.\n    *   In the Test Input (26x26), we can determine the boundaries by finding the midpoints between the bounding boxes of the groups.\n        *   **Horizontal Split (Top vs Bottom)**:\n            *   Top groups (TL, TR) end roughly at row 11.\n            *   Bottom groups (BL, BR) start roughly at row 19 (BL) and 20 (BR).\n            *   The gap is roughly rows 12-18. The midpoint is row 15.\n            *   Pixels in rows 0-15 are closer to the Top groups. Pixels in rows 16-25 are closer to the Bottom groups.\n        *   **Vertical Split (Top Half: TL vs TR)**:\n            *   Top-Left (TL) group ends at col 12. Top-Right (TR) group starts at col 19.\n            *   Gap is cols 13-18. Midpoint is between 15 and 16.\n            *   Cols 0-15 are closer to TL. Cols 16-25 are closer to TR.\n        *   **Vertical Split (Bottom Half: BL vs BR)**:\n            *   Bottom-Left (BL) group ends at col 5. Bottom-Right (BR) group starts at col 17.\n            *   Gap is cols 6-16 (11 columns). The exact middle is col 11 (distance 6 from both sides).\n            *   Assigning the tie to the left, Cols 0-11 are BL. Cols 12-25 are BR.\n\n3.  **Determine the Coloring (Topology)**:\n    *   In both examples, one of the four input groups contains a \"Key\": a 2x2 block of four distinct colors hidden inside the group's main color.\n    *   This Key defines the colors for the four output regions based on their quadrant position (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n    *   **Finding the Key in Test Input**:\n        *   Scanning the groups, the Top-Left group (Main color 9) contains a 2x2 pattern at rows 5-6 and cols 4-5 (indices 0-based):\n            *   (Row 5, Col 4): **3**\n            *   (Row 5, Col 5): **6**\n            *   (Row 6, Col 4): **4**\n            *   (Row 6, Col 5): **8**\n        *   The Key is `[[3, 6], [4, 8]]`.\n    *   **Mapping to Regions**:\n        *   Top-Left Region gets the Top-Left Key color: **3** (Green).\n        *   Top-Right Region gets the Top-Right Key color: **6** (Magenta).\n        *   Bottom-Left Region gets the Bottom-Left Key color: **4** (Yellow).\n        *   Bottom-Right Region gets the Bottom-Right Key color: **8** (Azure).\n\n4.  **Construct the Output**:\n    *   Create a 26x26 grid.\n    *   Fill **Rows 0-15, Cols 0-15** with Color **3**.\n    *   Fill **Rows 0-15, Cols 16-25** with Color **6**.\n    *   Fill **Rows 16-25, Cols 0-11** with Color **4**.\n    *   Fill **Rows 16-25, Cols 12-25** with Color **8**.\n\noutput:\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n

Manhattan-distance Voronoi diagram using scaled group center positions\n\n**For the test input:**\n\nGroups identified:\n- Group 9 (key): rows 4-11, cols 3-12, with embedded pattern `3,6 / 4,8`\n- Group 5: rows 6-17, cols 16-25 (right side)\n- Group 7: rows 19-24, cols 3-5 (lower-left)\n- Group 2: rows 20-23, cols 17-22 (lower-right)\n\n**Color mapping based on relative position to key group:**\n- Key group (9) \u2192 3 (top-left of pattern)\n- Group 5 (right) \u2192 6 (top-right of pattern)\n- Group 7 (lower-left) \u2192 4 (bottom-left of pattern)\n- Group 2 (lower-right) \u2192 8 (bottom-right of pattern)\n\n**Output size:** Total cells \u2248 48+62+12+18 = 140, so \u221a140 \u2248 12 \u2192 12\u00d712 grid\n\n**Seed positions (scaled to 12\u00d712):**\n- Seed 3 at (2, 2)\n-

<EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find the 4 \u201cmain\u201d foreground groups**  \n   Treat every non\u2011zero cell as foreground and split the input into **4 connected components** (4-neighborhood).  \n   Any small \u201cembedded\u201d colors inside a group (like the little 2\u00d72 of different colors) are **part of that same group**, not separate groups.\n\n2. **Extract the 2\u00d72 palette inside the top-left group**  \n   In each training example, one group contains a **2\u00d72 block of four distinct colors**.  \n   Read those four colors in positional order:\n   - palette_TL, palette_TR  \n   - palette_BL, palette_BR\n\n3. **Assign each of the 4 groups to a quadrant (TL/TR/BL/BR)**  \n   Use their overall positions in the input (e.g., by comparing their bounding boxes / centroids).  \n   Then map:\n   - TL group \u2192 palette_TL  \n   - TR group \u2192 palette_TR  \n   - BL group \u2192 palette_BL  \n   - BR group \u2192 palette_BR  \n\n4. **Work in half-resolution and build a Manhattan Voronoi partition**\n   - Downscale coordinates by factor 2: each original cell \\((r,c)\\) maps to \\((r//2,\\;c//2)\\).\n   - For each group, collect the set of its downscaled cells: these are the **seeds**.\n   - Crop to the bounding box of all downscaled seed cells (this defines the output size).\n   - For every output cell, assign it to the group with **minimum Manhattan distance** to that group\u2019s seed set (Voronoi / multi-source expansion).  \n     (If ties occur, a consistent fixed ordering works; here TL before TR before BL before BR.)\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n- The embedded 2\u00d72 palette inside the top-left (9) group is:\n  \\[\n  \\begin{matrix}\n  3 & 6\\\\\n  4 & 8\n  \\end{matrix}\n  \\]\n  So TL\u21923, TR\u21926, BL\u21924, BR\u21928.\n- The four main groups are positioned as:\n  - TL: the 9-group \u2192 color **3**\n  - TR: the 5-group \u2192 color **6**\n  - BL: the 7-group \u2192 color **4**\n  - BR: the 2-group \u2192 color **8**\n- After downscaling and cropping to the seed bbox, the output grid is **11\u00d712**, filled by the Manhattan Voronoi regions.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6

color key\nEach input has **four separated non-black connected components** (ignoring small internal colors inside a component). These four components act as **multi-source seeds**.\n\nOne of the components contains a **2\u00d72 block of four distinct colors** embedded inside it; this is a **color key** that tells which single color to paint each final region:\n\nIn the test input, inside the large **9** component there is a 2\u00d72 block:\n- top-left = **3**\n- top-right = **6**\n- bottom-left = **4**\n- bottom-right = **8**\n\nSo after we decide which cells belong to the *top-left seed*, *top-right seed*, *bottom-left seed*, *bottom-right seed*, we recolor those regions with **3, 6, 4, 8** respectively.\n\n### 2) Work on a reduced \u201cplanning\u201d grid (scale down by 2)\nAs in the solved examples, we form the output on a smaller grid by:\n1. Cropping a square around all nonzero content, padding with black as needed so the side length is even.\n2. **Downscaling by factor 2** (each output cell corresponds to a 2\u00d72 block of the cropped square).  \n   Any 2\u00d72 block that intersects one of the four components becomes a seed cell for that component in the reduced grid.\n\nFor this test, that produces a **12\u00d712** reduced grid with four seed areas (corresponding to the 9-, 5-, 7-, and 2-components).\n\n### 3) Manhattan Voronoi fill from the 4 seed areas\nOn that 12\u00d712 grid, fill every cell by assigning it to the seed component with the **smallest Manhattan distance** (multi-source BFS / Voronoi in L1 metric). This creates 4 connected regions that completely fill the grid with stair-stepped borders.\n\n### 4) Recolor regions using the 2\u00d72 key\nFinally recolor:\n- region of the **top-left** seed \u2192 **3**\n- region of the **top-right** seed \u2192 **6**\n- region of the **bottom-left** seed \u2192 **4**\n- region of the **bottom-right** seed \u2192 **8**\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n4,4,4,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,6,6  \n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      4,4,4,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,6,6\n      4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- SELECT THE BEST RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1. It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3.

Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2.

Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
