        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment: Vertical Flip and Shape Movement**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I need to transform a grid based on two example inputs and outputs. My immediate impression is that there's a vertical flip at play here, but the positions of objects within the grid seem to move as well. The examples also indicate there may be a gravity-like effect, pushing the items toward the top or bottom of the grid, possibly influencing their final layout.\n\n**Analyzing Example 1**\n\nDiving into Example 1, I see a 28x19 grid with a background of zero (black) and a scattering of shapes. The shapes seem to be cross-like structures, with the top-most one colored yellow and located in the top-left area. The output grid shows a vertical flip of the shapes along the grid's center axis. I'm noting that the positions of the shapes appear reversed vertically. The blue shape, initially in the middle of the right part of the input, is now placed at the bottom-right of the output, for example.\n\n**The Transformation Rules: Vertical Flip?**\n\nIt's evident the output has undergone a vertical flip. For example, a shape at input row $i$ is now at $H-1-i$. However, I notice the shapes themselves aren't rotated; they maintain their orientation. This is no simple 180-degree rotation. The object positions are vertically mirrored.\n\n**Example 2 and Identifying the Vertical Stacking Rule**\n\nExample 2 reinforces the idea of a vertical flip. However, the exact arrangement of the objects after the transformation is not fully explained. A key insight emerges: the objects move towards the edges. This could be interpreted as if some kind of gravity or repulsive force is at work pushing shapes into positions. The colors and initial positions influence where the objects \"end up\".\n\n**Discovering the \"Points Up/Down\" Rule for shape position**\n\nGoing back to the examples, I begin to suspect that shapes are moving along the horizontal position, but the y coordinate changes. It's like objects will stack on top of each other. The observation that shapes will move toward either the top or the bottom of the grid based on how they \"point\" is becoming prominent. By \"pointing\", I'm referring to a shape\u2019s visual orientation - the idea that an object is treated as if it has an arrow that points either up or down. A good example is the yellow object in Example 1.\n\n**Refining the \"Points Opposite\" Rule with Shape Weight**\n\nI also need to check the orientation. So, I need a rule for finding the shape\u2019s heavy side, and moving the shape based on its direction. The hypothesis is: shapes will move in the direction opposite to their orientation, if the shape is asymmetric. The more heavy, the more its direction is towards the heavy side. For symmetric shapes, the final movement will be based on background and shape.\n\n**Tackling the Test Input**\n\nFor the Test Input, I'm analyzing each shape (Green, Yellow, Blue, Orange, Magenta, Teal) based on their shape/symmetry, color, and initial position. Based on what I've discovered, the following predictions are set:\n\n*   **Green (3)** is symmetric, so should move up.\n*   **Yellow (4)** is T shape (Top heavy) and color 4, and moves down.\n*   **Blue (1)** is a T/Cross, Top heavy and moves down.\n*   **Orange (7)** is 7 shaped and Top Heavy, so must move up.\n*   **Magenta (6)** is an inverted cross and Top heavy, so must move down\n*   **Teal (8)** is L/Triangle, and Bottom heavy and move down.\n\n**The Test Input grid creation:**\n\nBased on the predicted movement, I'll need to create the final grid. I will put each shape into the target position at a particular row, while holding their original horizontal position. I am also making sure there is no collision or overlapping. I will put the items in the order listed. If there is a collision, the position will have to be recalculated.\n\nI am now confident and ready to create the final grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify a transformation based on examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Objects:** The grid contains several distinct shapes of single colors on a uniform background.\n2.  **Transformation:**\n    *   In Example 1 (Background 0), shapes move to the top or bottom edges of the grid.\n        *   Green (3) and Blue (1) move to the **Top**.\n        *   Red (2) and Yellow (4) move to the **Bottom**.\n    *   In Example 2 (Background 5), shapes also move to the top or bottom.\n        *   Red (2), Green (3), Orange (7), Maroon (9) move to the **Top**.\n        *   Blue (1), Yellow (4) move to the **Bottom**.\n3.  **Horizontal Position:** The objects maintain their column (X) positions. They only move vertically.\n4.  **Shape Orientation and Direction:**\n    *   The shapes maintain their orientation; they are not rotated or flipped.\n    *   The direction of movement (Up vs. Down) appears to correlate with the \"weight\" distribution of the shape (or where it \"points\") and/or color properties.\n    *   **Rule:** Shapes that are \"Top Heavy\" (center of mass is in the upper half) or point \"Down\" tend to move **Up**. Shapes that are \"Bottom Heavy\" (center of mass is in the lower half) or point \"Up\" tend to move **Down**.\n        *   *Ex 1 Blue (T-shape/Cross, top heavy) -> Moves Up.*\n        *   *Ex 2 Blue (Triangle, bottom heavy) -> Moves Down.*\n        *   *Ex 2 Orange (7-shape, top heavy) -> Moves Up.*\n        *   *Ex 2 Yellow (Inverted T, bottom heavy) -> Moves Down.*\n    *   **Exceptions/Color Rules:**\n        *   Example 1 Yellow (\"Gamma\" shape, top heavy) moves **Down**. This suggests a specific override for Yellow (Color 4) or even-numbered colors in specific contexts, or perhaps the specific shape (hook) points up? However, consistent behavior for Color 4 across examples (Ex 1 Down, Ex 2 Down) suggests **Yellow (4) always moves Down**.\n        *   Symmetric shapes: Green (3) moves **Up** in both examples. Red (2) moves Down in Ex 1 but Up in Ex 2.\n    *   **Consolidated Heuristic for Test Input:**\n        *   **Move Up:** Top-heavy shapes, Crosses (usually), Colors like Green(3), Orange(7).\n        *   **Move Down:** Bottom-heavy shapes, Yellow(4).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Size:** 19 rows x 28 columns. Background is 9 (Maroon).\n*   **Identified Shapes:**\n    1.  **Green (3)** at top right (Rows 2-4, Cols 22-24). Shape: Symmetric Cross/Diamond. Based on Ex 1 and Ex 2, Green moves **Up**.\n    2.  **Yellow (4)** at top center (Rows 4-6, Cols 15-17). Shape: T-shape (Top Heavy). However, Color 4 consistently moves **Down** in examples. We will move it **Down**.\n    3.  **Blue (1)** at top left (Rows 5-8, Cols 4-7). Shape: Cross/Sword (Top Heavy). Matches Ex 1 Blue. Moves **Up**.\n    4.  **Orange (7)** at middle left (Rows 7-8, Cols 11-12). Shape: \"7\" (Top Heavy). Matches Ex 2 Orange. Moves **Up**.\n    5.  **Magenta (6)** at middle right (Rows 11-14, Cols 22-25). Shape: Inverted Cross (Bottom Heavy). Matches bottom-heavy logic. Moves **Down**.\n    6.  **Teal (8)** at bottom left (Rows 15-16, Cols 1-2). Shape: \"L\" (Bottom Heavy). Matches bottom-heavy logic. Moves **Down**.\n\n**New Positions:**\n*   **Up Group (Row 0 aligned):** Blue (1), Orange (7), Green (3).\n*   **Down Group (Row 18 aligned):** Teal (8), Yellow (4), Magenta (6).\n\n**Construction:**\n*   **Blue (1):** Moves to Rows 0-3. Cols 4-7.\n*   **Orange (7):** Moves to Rows 0-1. Cols 11-12.\n*   **Green (3):** Moves to Rows 0-2. Cols 22-24. Note the center pixel is background (9).\n*   **Teal (8):** Moves to Rows 17-18. Cols 1-2.\n*   **Yellow (4):** Moves to Rows 16-18. Cols 15-17.\n*   **Magenta (6):** Moves to Rows 15-18. Cols 22-25.\n\nNo horizontal overlaps occur between shapes moving to the same edge.\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9\n9,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**I've got this!** I'm tasked with solving an ARC problem using two examples and a test input. I need to figure out how objects move around in the grid.\n\nFirst, I carefully analyzed the examples:  shapes (like Ts, Ls, and blocks) are scattered on a background, then they shift vertically. My initial thought was that objects were \"falling\" based on their original vertical position. But that led to inconsistencies.  I considered many factors:\n\n*   **Object Properties:** Color, shape (hollow, solid), number of pixels, bounding box dimensions, and shape \"pointing\" direction.\n*   **Grid Dimensions:**  The number of rows and columns, including how they related to the shapes.\n*   **The Background Color:** Does the background color influence the movement?\n\nI started by looking for patterns in pixel counts, shapes, and positions, but the examples were complex.  Some objects moved to the top, others to the bottom. I noticed that shapes were always vertically flipped in the output. That became a core rule.\n\n*   **Vertical Flip:** Each object is flipped vertically.\n\nBut that still didn't explain the final position. I considered a lot of hypotheses:\n\n*   **\"Pointy\" shapes:** Do those with a pointy bottom go top, and pointy top go down?\n*   **\"Heaviest Part\"**: Does moving shapes' centers of mass play a role?\n*   **Holes matter**: Do objects with holes or open areas go up?\n\nThat's when I had a breakthrough. I realized that the \"T-Shape\" has a relationship.\n\n*   **T-Shape Rule:** Flipped T-up goes to Up.\n*   **T-Shape Rule:** Flipped T-Down goes to Down.\n\nI created a final plan:\n\n1.  **Parse Objects:** Extract each object from the input.\n2.  **Flip Vertically:** Flip the extracted object.\n3.  **Preserve X:** Keep the original x-coordinate.\n4.  **Final Y:** Determine y, placing to either the top or bottom of the grid.\n5.  **Rebuild Grid:**  Construct the new output grid.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rules are as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects**: Extract all contiguous colored shapes from the background (which is `9` in the test input, `0` in Ex 1, `5` in Ex 2).\n2.  **Vertical Flip**: Every object is flipped vertically (mirrored across its horizontal axis).\n3.  **Preserve Horizontal Position**: The column indices (x-coordinates) of the object remain unchanged.\n4.  **Move to Top or Bottom**: Each object moves vertically to flush against either the top edge (Row 0) or the bottom edge (Last Row) of the grid.\n    *   **Logic for Direction**:\n        *   Objects that result in a **\"T pointing Up\"** or stable pyramid shape *after flipping* (e.g., Ex 1 Blue) move to the **Top**.\n        *   Objects that result in a **\"T pointing Down\"** or unstable shape *after flipping* (e.g., Ex 2 Blue, Ex 2 Yellow) move to the **Bottom**.\n        *   **Hollow objects** (Ex 2 Green, Ex 2 Red) move to the **Top**.\n        *   **L-shapes** (Ex 2 Orange, Maroon) move to the **Top**.\n        *   Based on these patterns, we classify the test shapes:\n            *   **Shape 8 (Teal)**: L-shape $\\rightarrow$ **Top**.\n            *   **Shape 1 (Blue)**: Cross/Sword.

Column positions are preserved, only row positions change\n\n**Identifying the Rule:**\n\nDividing the grid into thirds horizontally:\n- **Left third of columns**: Patterns swap vertical halves (top\u2192bottom, bottom\u2192top)\n- **Center third of columns**: Patterns move to the top\n- **Right third of columns**: Patterns maintain their vertical half (top stays top, bottom stays bottom)\n\nAll patterns shift to their destination edge (top patterns align to row 0, bottom patterns align to last row).\n\n**Applying to Test Input (19 rows \u00d7 28 columns):**\n\nColumn regions: Left (0-9), Center (10-18), Right (19-27)\nRow regions: Top (0-9), Bottom (10-18)\n\nPatterns identified:\n- **Color 3** (rows 2-4, cols 22-24): Right + Top \u2192 stays Top \u2192 rows 0-2\n- **Color 4** (rows 4-6, cols 15-17): Center + Top \u2192 Top \u2192 rows 0-2  \n- **Color 1** (rows 5-8, cols 4-7): Left + Top \u2192 swaps to Bottom \u2192 rows 15-18\n- **Color 7** (rows 7-8, cols 11-12): Center + Top \u2192 Top \u2192 rows 0-1\n- **Color 6** (rows 11-14, cols 21-24): Right + Bottom \u2192 stays Bottom \u2192 rows 15-18\n- **Color 8** (rows 15-16, cols 1-2): Left + Bottom \u2192 swaps to Top \u2192 rows 0-1\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\n```\n9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n1. **The background color** is the most frequent value (Example 1: `0`, Example 2: `5`).  \n2. Pixels of the **same non-background color move together as one rigid object**, even if they are not 4-connected (Example 1\u2019s color `2` has separated pixels but they keep their relative positions after moving).\n3. Every colored object is moved **only vertically**, keeping all **columns unchanged**, and it is snapped either to the **top edge** (its highest pixel goes to row 1) or the **bottom edge** (its lowest pixel goes to the last row).\n\n### Key inference: how to choose \u201ctop\u201d vs \u201cbottom\u201d\n\n1. Find the horizontal span that contains all colored pixels: from **min occupied column** to **max occupied column**.\n2. Inside that span, find the **longest consecutive run of completely empty columns** (columns containing only background).  \n   This run is a **vertical divider gap** splitting the scene into a **left side** and **right side**.\n3. Split the grid horizontally into **upper half** and **lower half** (using the grid\u2019s middle row).\n4. Decide each object\u2019s destination:\n   - **Right side of the divider:** objects go to the **same** side they started on  \n     (upper \u2192 top, lower \u2192 bottom).\n   - **Left side of the divider:** objects go to the **opposite** side  \n     (upper \u2192 bottom, lower \u2192 top).\n5. Finally, shift each object vertically so it touches its target edge.\n\n---\n\n## Apply to the test input\n\n- Background is `9`.\n- Occupied columns are: `2,3,5,6,7,8,12,13,16,17,18,22,23,24,25`.  \n  So min occupied = 2, max occupied = 25.\n- Empty-column runs inside 2..25 include **9\u201311** (length 3) and **19\u201321** (length 3).  \n  Choose the leftmost longest gap \u21d2 divider gap is **columns 9\u201311**.\n  - Left side: columns **2\u20138**\n  - Right side: columns **12\u201325**\n- Grid height is 19 \u21d2 upper half is rows **1\u20139**, lower half rows **10\u201319**.\n\nObjects:\n- Left side: color **1** (starts at row 6, upper) \u21d2 **swap \u21d2 bottom**; color **8** (starts at row 16, lower) \u21d2 **swap \u21d2 top**\n- Right side: colors **3,4,7** start in upper half \u21d2 **top**; color **6** starts in lower half \u21d2 **bottom**\n\nAfter shifting each to its edge, we get:\n\n### Output grid\n9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9",

The output keeps the same background.  \n2. The picture is split into **two vertical panels** by finding the **widest internal vertical gap** (a consecutive run of columns that are entirely background *and* lie between occupied column groups).  \n   - This gap acts as a divider; columns left of it are the **left panel**, columns right of it are the **right panel**.\n3. Treat each colored shape as an **object** (a connected component of same color; diagonal adjacency matters here because diagonally \u201cattached\u201d parts move together in the examples).\n4. For each object, compute its vertical bounding box:\n   - `top = smallest row index of the object`\n   - `bottom = largest row index of the object`\n   - `dist_to_top = top`\n   - `dist_to_bottom = (H-1) - bottom`\n5. **Movement rule depends on the panel**:\n   - **Left panel:** move the object to the **farther** vertical edge  \n     (if `dist_to_top > dist_to_bottom` move to top, else move to bottom).\n   - **Right panel:** move the object to the **nearer** vertical edge  \n     (if `dist_to_top < dist_to_bottom` move to top, else move to bottom).\n6. Move by **pure vertical translation** so the object\u2019s bounding box touches the chosen edge:\n   - Move-to-top shift: `-top`\n   - Move-to-bottom shift: `(H-1) - bottom`\n   Horizontal positions (columns) are unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n- Background is `9`.\n- Occupied column groups are separated by the largest internal empty-column gap; the leftmost maximum gap is **columns 8\u201310**, so:\n  - **Left panel:** columns `0\u20137`\n  - **Right panel:** columns `11\u201327`\n\nObjects and where they go:\n- Left panel:  \n  - Color `8` (near bottom) \u2192 farthest edge is **top** \u2192 shift up to rows 0\u20131  \n  - Color `1` (near top) \u2192 farthest edge is **bottom** \u2192 shift down to rows 15\u201318\n- Right panel:  \n  - Colors `7`, `4`, `3` (all closer to top) \u2192 nearest edge is **top** \u2192 shift up  \n  - Color `6` (closer to bottom) \u2192 nearest edge is **bottom** \u2192 shift down to rows 15\u201318\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9",
