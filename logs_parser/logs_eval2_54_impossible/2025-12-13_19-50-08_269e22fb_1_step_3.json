Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into a Texture-Based ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. My goal is to figure out the rule that transforms a small input image into a larger output image.  The user is an expert in their field, so I can assume they have a strong understanding of the types of patterns that are common in this space. I'm focusing on the relationship between 5 examples, which I am told are similar to the final test input, and their corresponding outputs.  The task is to generalize from the given examples and generate a $20 \\times 20$ grid from a $10 \\times 10$ input.\n\nI start by looking at a sample where I have an $8 \\times 10$ input becoming a $20 \\times 20$ output.  My first thought is that there must be some geometric transformation, such as rotation, tiling or reflection.  I check to see if there is some relationship in the dimensions, but this doesn't offer an immediate insight.  I notice that the values in the grid are either 7s or 8s.  I hypothesize that the output might be constructed by rotating or tiling the input. I look at specific areas: top left, top right, bottom right. No immediately obvious.\n\nI move onto the second example, with a $16 \\times 8$ input, and note how the $20 \\times 20$ output is structured. The input's dimensions don't seem to have a direct mathematical relationship to the output's size.  I keep trying to compare input-to-output element by element, but I'm not seeing any obvious transformation. I consider the input being rotated to build the output, then abandoned it.\n\nThen I get a key insight: **the input isn't always at the top-left of the output**.  That makes a huge difference.  It implies I need to figure out where the *input's values* can be found in the *output* and the transformations from there.\n\nMy next step is to look at Ex. 3 ($10 \\times 10$ input to $20 \\times 20$ output). This is a cleaner example where the input appears at the top left and I'm looking for repetitions or patterns within the output image. I start checking for rotations, mirrors, or translations.  I can't find anything simple.  It's clear that the $20 \\times 20$ grid has some internal structure, like a repeating pattern, but the details are elusive.\n\nI look back at the original examples again and notice there's a variation in where the inputs are placed relative to the output, which shows that a specific input placement isn't a rule. I go back to thinking about the output being a completion of the input. Now I'm thinking, this might be a **Tessellation** pattern, not simple rotation or tiling.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about Overlapping patterns, and where to find the key. I focus on Ex 4, where there is $13 \\times 12$ input that is related to the complete image $20 \\times 20$, and I realize the Input can be thought of as a part of a larger, periodic, grid. I hypothesize that the task is to extrapolate the $20 \\times 20$ grid from a patch of it.\n\nI reexamine the example with a $16 \\times 8$ input and the $20 \\times 20$ output to see if the translation approach will help. The Input *is* translated to create the Output. The task is now about where the given block can appear in a larger construction.\n\nLet's test this in all the examples.  I want to determine where the values are in the output relative to the input. For this I need to find all the positions in the output where the input appears.\n\nI start checking for translational symmetry (tiling). I know that it cannot be simple tiling, as proven with Ex 3, but something else.\n\nI have an epiphany. Since the pattern has to fill a whole grid, it must have some periodicity in both $x$ and $y$. Could it be a tiling with a period? I go to a simpler example (Ex 3), and attempt to locate a repeating pattern, which can then be combined, as a rule. No luck.\n\nGiven the repeating structure, maybe a reflection (or a horizontal mirror?)? Let's assume the $20 \\times 20$ has some center of symmetry. However, after inspection, I find that simple reflection isn't working.\n\nI then check with another point of view: can the output be a translation of the input? I try to locate the output by shifting the input, but the matching doesn'\n\nThe problem asks to transform a partial grid (or a pattern seed) into a completed $20 \\times 20$ grid. Analyzing the solved examples, we observe that the output is always $20 \\times 20$, and the input is always a sub-rectangular region of the output. The positions vary: top-left, bottom-right, or offset. \n\nFor the **Test Input**, the grid size is $10 \\times 10$. Since the output must be $20 \\times 20$, the input covers exactly one quadrant of the output area. In Example 3, a $10 \\times 10$ input corresponded to the top-left quadrant. The patterns in the examples (especially Ex 1, 2, 4, 5) and the Test Input resemble textures or woven patterns. A common way to generate a larger coherent texture from a patch is by tiling it. Specifically, **mirrored tiling** (reflectional symmetry) ensures that the edges match perfectly, creating a continuous pattern without seamless jumps.\n\nLet's check the edge continuity for mirrored tiling with the Test Input:\n- **Right Edge of Input (Col 9)**: `7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8`.\n- **Horizontal Reflection**: The left edge of the reflected block will be the same as the right edge of the input. Thus, at the vertical boundary (between col 9 and 10), we will have `...8 | 8...`, `...7 | 7...`, etc. This creates a perfect match.\n- **Bottom Edge of Input (Row 9)**: `7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`.\n- **Vertical Reflection**: The top edge of the reflected block (in the bottom-left quadrant) will be the same as the bottom edge of the input. Thus, at the horizontal boundary (between row 9 and 10), we will have `...8` matching `8...`. This also creates a perfect match.\n\nTherefore, the transformation is to construct the $20 \\times 20$ grid by placing the Input in the Top-Left, and filling the other quadrants by mirroring the Input:\n1.  **Top-Left (0-9, 0-9):** Original Input.\n2.  **Top-Right (0-9, 10-19):** Input flipped horizontally.\n3.  **Bottom-Left (10-19, 0-9):** Input flipped vertically.\n4.  **Bottom-Right (10-19, 10-19):** Input flipped both horizontally and vertically.\n\n**Input Grid:**\nRow 0: 8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7\nRow 1: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\nRow 2: 8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7\nRow 3: 7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,8,7\nRow 4: 7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,7\nRow 5: 7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\nRow 6: 7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\nRow 7: 8,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\nRow 8: 7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\nRow 9: 7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\n**Completed Output:**\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8\n7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,8,7,7,8,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7\n7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,8\n7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7\n7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7\n7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7\n7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7\n8,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,8,7,7,8,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into a Complex Pattern Recognition Task**\n\nAlright, here's the deal: I'm staring at this ARC problem, and it's a real puzzle. I'm given a bunch of examples with input and output grids, and my job is to figure out the general rule so I can solve the test case.  It seems like the core idea is taking a small grid and somehow expanding it to a larger one, a 20x20 output, specifically.\n\nMy brain's firing off a bunch of ideas, starting with the simplest.  Could the output just be a scaled-up version of the input, like a bigger, blockier version of the image? Maybe rotation or reflection? Nope, doesn't seem to fit at all. Then I looked for repetitions: is the output a tiled version of the input? Tried this with the examples.\n\nBut things get tricky fast.  The input sizes are all over the place (8x10, 10x10, etc.), but the output is always 20x20.  This strongly suggests that there's a fixed-size target grid and that the input is a kind of blueprint or a section of this target. So the puzzle becomes, *where* does the input \"fit\" within that target?\n\nI began trying to deduce some hidden regularities. Are the values of the input, which represent colors, just randomly arranged? The answer is no, a careful study of the numbers shows some lines and periodic shapes. Maybe some kind of fractal scaling or repeated pattern.\n\nMy initial thought was that the small input (like the 8x10 or the 10x10) is a crop. Then the full 20x20 is constructed by rotating or reflecting this \"key\". But the details don't match exactly, and there are distortions. So it's not a simple copy.\n\nThe other idea is to see the grid as 2x2 tiling pattern: top left = A, top right = A rotated/flipped, bottom left = A rotated/flipped, bottom right = rotation or mirror.\nThen I spent ages looking for patterns within the input itself. Are the rows repeating? Are there repeating columns?  I tried to fit rotations/reflections, tried looking for periodic structure in the color values. There are lines and shapes. The Input seems to create boundaries.\n\nFinally, after lots of testing, I think the real pattern in my head is **tiling the 10x10 image into a 20x20 pattern. It's the most common and robust option.** Although there is no evidence to back this exactly, this aligns with the observations I made about the given examples.\n\n\nThe problem asks to generate a 20x20 output grid based on a 10x10 input grid.\nAnalyzing the examples:\n- Example 1: Input 8x10, Output 20x20. Input is the top-left corner.\n- Example 3: Input 10x10, Output 20x20. Input is the top-left corner. The output pattern appears to be a continuation (tiling with some shifting/evolution) of the input pattern.\n- Example 4: Input 13x12, Output 20x20. Input matches a specific crop of the output.\n- Example 5: Input 8x10, Output 20x20. Input matches the bottom-right corner.\n\nThe Test Input is 10x10. Based on Example 3 (same dimensions), the Input is likely the top-left quadrant of the Output. The Output is formed by extending the pattern visible in the Input.\nThe pattern in the Test Input shows horizontal rows with shifting features (e.g., rows 5-8 show a block of 7s shifting right).\nWithout a precise rule for the \"evolution\" of the pattern across the boundaries (which appears to be complex and specific to the texture), the most reasonable approximation for the \"continuation\" of a 10x10 pattern into a 20x20 grid in this context\u2014and preserving the periodicity seen in textural examples\u2014is to **tile the input**.\nIn Example 3, tiling the input 2x2 provides a strong approximation of the output structure (green lines continuing).\nTherefore, I will construct the output by repeating the 10x10 input grid 4 times to fill the 20x20 grid.\n\nOutput Grid Construction:\n- Top-Left (0-9, 0-9): Input\n- Top-Right (0-9, 10-19): Input\n- Bottom-Left (10-19, 0-9): Input\n- Bottom-Right (10-19, 10-19): Input\n\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7\n7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,8,7\n7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n8,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7\n7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,8,7\n7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n8,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I notice several patterns:\n\n1. **Output dimensions**: All outputs are 20\u00d720 regardless of input size.\n\n2. **Input placement**: The input appears to be placed somewhere within the output grid (often top-left for square inputs like Example 3 which is 10\u00d710).\n\n3. **Pattern extension**: The colored pixels (the non-background color, which is 7 in most examples) form lines/curves that get extended throughout the 20\u00d720 grid. These extensions follow the \"direction\" or \"flow\" of the patterns in the input.\n\nFor the test input (10\u00d710):\n- There are vertical lines of 7s at columns 7 and 9 (appearing in most rows)\n- There's a dense block of 7s in the lower-left (rows 5-9, columns 0-5)\n- There's an alternating column pattern in the upper rows\n- Row 1 is all 8s (background)\n\nBased on Example 3 (which also had a 10\u00d710 input placed at top-left), I'll construct the output by:\n1. Placing the input at top-left (rows 0-9, cols 0-9)\n2. Extending the vertical lines at cols 7 and 9 downward\n3. Extending the horizontal/diagonal patterns to fill the remaining space\n4. Maintaining the alternating column pattern and block structure\n\n```\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8\n7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,8,7,7,8,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7\n7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7\n8,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7\n7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8\n7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,8,7,7,8,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7\n7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7\n8,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,7\n7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8\n```",

Repeat (tile) it horizontally and vertically until a 20\u00d720 grid is filled.\n   - For a 10\u00d710 input, this is exactly a **2\u00d72** tiling (two copies across, two copies down).\n\nApplying that to the 10\u00d710 test input produces the following 20\u00d720 output.\n\n```\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7\n7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,8,7\n7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n8,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,7\n7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,8,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8,8,7\n7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n8,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,8,7,8,7\n7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",
