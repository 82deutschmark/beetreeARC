Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, let's break down this ARC problem. The user wants me to essentially play digital Lego, assembling shapes based on how red pixels connect them.**\n\nIt starts with identifying the input as grids filled with numbers, representing color blocks. The main goal is to figure out the transformation rules that rearrange the blocks from the input to the output, using example pairs to learn the pattern. The size of these grids is 22x22.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze each example. I see that the colored shapes are defined by how pixels are grouped. And here's the kicker: they're not just scattered; each object has these red pixels that act like connectors. Example 1 has five objects, all having a certain shape and size, with unique pixel colors associated with their shapes. Now, I understand that it is about identifying components by colored shapes + markers and establishing the connection interface.\n\nThe red pixels have a strong connection to one another. Each object is connected with at least one other object by aligning them via the red markers. In Example 1, the red pixels seem to group and define the objects. It's like finding the objects in the image. I look at each shape in the output grid. I am checking the connectivity or stacking order. For example, Green (3) is on the top, then Teal(8), Yellow(4) etc. I keep track of each object's red connectors. When the two objects are connected, their red pixels are the same.\n\nA key hypothesis is that the red pixels, or \"markers\", are the crucial link. The task requires arranging these components into a composite picture, using the \"connectors\" to attach the pieces. I consider that the red pixels act as attachment points or shared features. Then comes the tricky part: working out the exact rules. The example shows that red markers are still visible, implying they are not merged, but they determine relative positions of the shapes. This is all about how shapes fit together based on those markers.\n\nSo, I analyze the objects in example 1. Shape 8 (Teal) has markers at Row 1 Col 15 and Row 1 Col 19. And another marker at Row 5. I look at its shape mask and its marker position from origin. It has markers at position (1,15), (1,19), and (5, 16), (5,18). And I do the same analysis for Shape 3. For the rest of the shapes, I look for their coordinates and their markers as well. Then I trace the markers in the Output and use them as connection interfaces to verify my rules.\n\nA connection rule seems to appear. For example Shape 3 (Green) has bottom markers and Shape 8 has top markers. I notice that these two markers are aligned in the output and form a connection. This is true for Shape 8 to Shape 4 (Yellow) and Shape 4 to Shape 1 (Blue) to Shape 5 (Grey).\n\nIn the output, I see the result is like a vertical chain of shapes. So, I will create a graph using these red pixels. I will assemble the scattered pieces into a single structure. All rules point out that the task is to assemble the scattered pieces into a single structure using red pixels to create the connections.\n\nThen comes Example 2. Let's see if the theory holds. This time, there are similar components and these red markers seem to show again. Now, there's another point of interest here, there are red connectors floating. But, I think this works: they still behave as connecters to the other blocks by overlapping.\n\nI identify the components using the example and their markers and test the process again. Shape A (Pink) has a different shape and the markers are at its corners. The same goes for the rest of the shapes. So, to ensure connection, I need to look for two patterns or overlapping connectors. I want the objects' structures to match up based on where those markers are. The connections will create structures from top to bottom.\n\nFinally, I move to the Test input. Using the insights from the examples, I first identify all components and extract each shape, plus the red markers for this final task.\n\nThis process involves looking at the input, seeing where the red connectors are, and then assembling them into one image, with a strong focus on connecting those red dots. I will define an interface for each shape, an interface defined by red pixel's configuration, which has the direction and pattern, and then, reconstruct the whole object. I just need to match the markers, identify the \"root\" block, and then build from there, assembling the rest based on those connectors. I will then have the final output, like building a 3-dimensional machine from pieces. Let's see!\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we analyze the connectivity logic from the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Logic derived from Examples:**\n1.  **Object Identification**: The input grid contains several distinct colored \"objects\" (clusters of colored pixels). Each object is associated with red pixels (`2`), which act as \"markers\" or \"connectors\".\n2.  **Assembly**: The goal is to assemble these scattered objects into a single composite structure.\n3.  **Connection Rule**: Objects connect where their red markers (`2`) overlap and match in pattern (e.g., orientation and spacing).\n    -   When two objects connect, they are translated so that their matching markers align (occupy the same coordinates).\n    -   The final output preserves the markers at the connection points.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nWe identify the following components and their markers in the test input:\n1.  **Green (3)**: Bottom-Left (Rows 21-24). Markers on the **Right** side at relative positions.\n2.  **Maroon (9)**: Middle-Left (Rows 7-10). Markers on the **Left** side.\n3.  **Yellow (4)**: Center (Rows 12-15). Markers on **Top**, **Left**, and **Right**.\n4.  **Small Teal (8)**: Top-Left (Rows 3-4). Markers on **Top** (matching Yellow's top-left markers).\n5.  **Large Teal (8)**: Top-Right (Rows 2-5). Markers on **Left** and **Bottom**.\n6.  **Blue (1)**: Right (Rows 11-14). Markers on **Top** and **Bottom**.\n7.  **Orange (7)**: Bottom-Middle (Row 22). Markers on **Top**.\n\n**Assembly Steps:**\n1.  **Green & Yellow**: Green's right markers align with Yellow's left markers. Green attaches to the left of Yellow.\n2.  **Maroon & Green**: Maroon's left markers align with Green's markers (specifically fitting on top of the Green shape). Maroon sits on top of Green.\n3.  **Small Teal & Yellow**: Small Teal's markers (`2,0,2`) match the left part of Yellow's top markers. Small Teal sits on top of the connector extending to the left of the Yellow block.\n4.  **Large Teal & Yellow**: Large Teal's left marker aligns with Yellow's right marker. Large Teal attaches to the right of Yellow.\n5.  **Blue & Large Teal**: Blue's top markers align with Large Teal's bottom marker. Blue hangs below Large Teal.\n6.  **Orange & Blue**: Orange's top markers align with Blue's bottom markers. Orange hangs below Blue.\n\n**Final Structure:**\n-   **Left Column**: Maroon on top of Green.\n-   **Middle Column**: Small Teal (top-left) and Yellow (center).\n-   **Right Column**: Large Teal (top), Blue (middle), Orange (bottom).\n\nWe reconstruct the grid by calculating the offsets for each piece to satisfy the marker overlaps and placing them into the output grid, centered.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n-   **Maroon (9)**: Top-left.\n-   **Small Teal (8)**: To the right of Maroon.\n-   **Green (3)**: Below Maroon.\n-   **Yellow (4)**: Right of Green, Below Small Teal.\n-   **Large Teal (8)**: Right of Yellow.\n-   **Blue (1)**: Below Large Teal.\n-   **Orange (7)**: Below Blue.\n\nAll connectors (`2`) are preserved at the interfaces.\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,2,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,2,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**I've got a complex ARC task here, and I'm diving in!** The goal is to rearrange shapes within a grid based on examples. The input grids are sparse with distinct colored shapes. Example 1 has a large grid with shapes of different colors like teal, blue, yellow, gray, and green. Each shape is characterized by its color and a unique pattern of pixels, with the red pixel '2' serving as crucial connectors. The task seems to involve a transformation where these scattered shapes are combined into a single structured output. I've broken down the shapes in Example 1, noting their sizes, positions, and, most importantly, the presence and position of the '2' connectors.\n\nFrom the analysis, I've hypothesized that the color '2' (red) acts as a linking point for the shapes. In the input, the '2' pixels are associated with each shape, and in the output, the shapes are arranged so that their '2's overlap or touch. I'm focusing on finding the correspondence between the arrangement of 2's in the input and output. It appears the objective is to build a single connected structure or tree, by correctly matching up the '2' connectors in the shapes.\n\nAnalyzing the shapes' connectors is a key strategy for solving the puzzle. Examining the output, it's a vertical stack, with the green shape on top, followed by teal, yellow, blue, and grey. It seems that the green shape's '2' is connecting to the teal shape's '2', and this pattern appears to continue throughout the entire structure. I also noted that the placement of a red '2' is essential for determining which shapes should combine or form the final layout.\n\nNext, I'll review how this concept applies to Example 2. I'm going to determine which parts connect, and the order of joining using the same principles. The analysis of Example 2 revealed a similar pattern of the '2' pixels as connectors. The strategy is to establish a connection between the shapes by aligning their unique '2' configurations. The goal is to determine the arrangement or order, especially by determining the vertical and horizontal structure.\n\nAfter analyzing both examples, I formulated an algorithm: Parse the shapes, identify connectors (color 2), identify the positions/directions of 2s on each shape's interface, and assemble to an output grid. Then, I am moving to the Test input and I'm going through the process again: I will analyze each shape's structure, identify its connectors, and figure out how they connect, and what the relative positioning is. It seems there are new challenges: different shapes that combine to make the tree, and at least one is \"encapsulating\" or is built around others. In the Test Input, there's another challenge with the shapes. I noticed an odd 2 at the Teal-Right shape, and the shape seems to not fully fit and is misaligned. I will work with the assumption that the 2s are critical, and will re-map the shapes if I made an error during the initial analysis.\n\nI'm starting to build a grid of the shapes.\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we need to understand how the disparate shapes in the input grid are assembled into the final structure in the output grid.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes:** The input contains several distinct shapes (connected components of non-zero colors). Each shape has specific \"connector\" pixels colored Red (2).\n2.  **Identify Connections:** The Red (2) pixels act as snap points. When two shapes are assembled, their red connectors overlap. We can deduce the assembly order by matching the spatial patterns (spacing and alignment) of these connectors.\n    *   **Orange Shape (7s):** Located at the bottom (Row 22). It has two top connectors spaced by 5 pixels (Columns 12 and 17). This acts as the **Base**.\n    *   **Blue Shape (1s):** A frame structure. It has two bottom connectors spaced by 5 pixels (Columns 19 and 24). This matches the Orange base. It also has two top connectors spaced by 3 pixels (Columns 20 and 23). **Blue sits on Orange.**\n    *   **Teal-Right Shape (8s):** A large arch. It has two bottom connectors spaced by 5 pixels (Columns 17 and 22). This also matches the Orange base. Since the Blue frame fits inside this arch, **Teal-Right also sits on Orange**, surrounding the Blue shape.\n    *   **Green Shape (3s):** It has two bottom connectors spaced by 3 pixels (Columns 3 and 6, relative to its position, or derived from input spacing). This matches the top of the Blue shape. **Green sits on Blue.**\n    *   **Maroon Shape (9s):** It has a single bottom connector (Column 5) and a side connector. The Green shape has a matching top connector (Column 5). **Maroon sits on Green.**\n    *   **Yellow Shape (4s):** It has a connector on its right side that matches the left connector of the Maroon shape. **Yellow attaches to the left of Maroon.**\n    *   **Teal-Left Shape (Small 8s):** It has top connectors spaced by 2 pixels. The Yellow shape has top connectors spaced by 2 pixels. **Teal-Left sits on top of Yellow.**\n\n3.  **Assembly:** We construct the final object by placing the Orange base and stacking the other shapes according to the connection hierarchy derived above. The final position is usually centered or aligned to fit the grid.\n\n**Step-by-Step Construction:**\n\n1.  **Base:** Place the Orange shape (7s) at the bottom.\n2.  **Level 1:** Place the Teal-Right arch (8s) and the Blue frame (1s) on top of the Orange base. They share the same connection points on the Orange base. The Blue frame sits inside the Teal arch.\n3.  **Level 2:** Place the Green shape (3s) on top of the Blue frame.\n4.  **Level 3:** Place the Maroon shape (9s) on top of the Green shape.\n5.  **Level 4:** Attach the Yellow shape (4s) to the left side of the Maroon shape.\n6.  **Level 5:** Place the Teal-Left shape (Small 8s) on top of the Yellow shape.\n\nThe red connectors (2s) are preserved at the joints.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\n\nOutput Grid:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,1,0,0,1,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "All non\u2011zero cells form several disconnected \u201cparts\u201d. In both solved examples, the color **2** cells act like **connectors**: parts are translated (no rotation) so that connector cells from different parts **overlap** (become the same grid cells). A valid overlap happens when each overlapped \u201c2\u201d is adjacent to the body of each part on opposite sides (so the two parts \u201cface\u201d each other through that connector). The large **4** block (with its attached 2s) stays fixed and acts as the anchor; everything else is moved to snap into it (directly or indirectly) by matching connector patterns.\n\nFor the test input:\n\n1. **Identify connected components** (include the 2s attached to them). We have:\n   - the anchored **4** rectangle with four single 2-connection points,\n   - a \u201cbig\u201d **8** part with four 2-connectors,\n   - a **9** part with a bottom *pair* of 2s,\n   - a \u201csmall\u201d **8** part with a top *pair* of 2s,\n   - a **3** part with a bottom *pair* of 2s and two other 2s,\n   - a **1** part with top/bottom *pairs* of 2s,\n   - a **7** bar with a top *pair* of 2s.\n\n2. **Snap the obvious pair-to-pair matches** (same spacing):\n   - The **9** bottom pair matches the **small 8** top pair \u21d2 small 8 goes directly under 9.\n   - The **3** bottom pair matches the **1** top pair \u21d2 1 goes under 3.\n   - The **1** bottom pair matches the **7** top pair \u21d2 7 goes under 1.\n\n3. **Attach the chain to the fixed 4-block using a 2\u2011connector \u201ccorner\u201d match**:\n   - The **3** part has two connectors with the same relative offset as the **left** and **bottom** connectors of the fixed 4-block, so translating the 3-part to overlap those two 2s automatically fixes the whole (3\u20131\u20137) chain position.\n\n4. **Attach the big 8 to the fixed 4-block** the same way:\n   - The **big 8** has two connectors whose offset matches the **top** and **right** connectors of the fixed 4-block \u21d2 translate big 8 so those two 2s overlap.\n\n5. **Attach the 9(+small8) assembly to the big 8**:\n   - The remaining two connectors on the big 8 have the same relative offset as the remaining two unused connectors on the 9-part \u21d2 overlap them, which fixes the 9(+small8) position.\n\nAfter these snaps, all parts form one connected assembly, and everything else is 0.\n\nCompleted output grid (26\u00d726):\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n1. **Non\u2011zero cells form separate \u201cparts\u201d** (connected components).  \n   Each part is mostly one color (the \u201cbody\u201d), and it may include some **color `2` pixels attached to it**.\n\n2. **Those `2` pixels act like connectors.**  \n   In the outputs, the colored parts are **translated (moved without rotation)** so that:\n   - the whole set of parts becomes **one assembled structure**\n   - parts \u201cjoin\u201d by having **matching connector pairs (`2` pixels) land on exactly the same coordinates** (so the same `2` cell belongs to both parts in the final overlay)\n\n3. The **`4` part is the anchor**: in both examples the `4` block stays in the same place, and everything else is moved to connect to it.\n\n---\n\n### Applying this to the test\n\n**Step 1: Identify the parts** (each is a connected component including its attached `2`s):\n- Anchor: the big **`4` rectangle** (kept fixed)\n- Other parts: a **`1` part**, a **`3` part**, a **`9` part**, a large **`8` part**, a small **`8` part**, and a **`7` bar**  \n  (The `2`s attached to each are their connectors.)\n\n**Step 2: Match connector-pairs by their relative offsets**  \nParts connect when they each have a pair of `2` pixels with the same relative spacing (so they can overlap by translation).  \nThis uniquely forms a chain:\n\n`7  \u2194  1  \u2194  3  \u2194  4  \u2194  8(big)  \u2194  9  \u2194  8(small)`\n\n**Step 3: Translate each part so the chosen connector-pairs overlap**, keeping the `4` part fixed.  \n(Doing this pair-by-pair determines one consistent placement for all parts.)\n\n**Step 4: Draw all translated parts into a blank 26\u00d726 grid** (overlaps occur only on `2` connector cells).\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",
