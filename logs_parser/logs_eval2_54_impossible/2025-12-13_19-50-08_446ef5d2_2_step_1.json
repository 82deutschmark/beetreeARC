        "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break this down. My goal is to figure out how to solve this ARC task based on the provided examples and test input.**\n\nFirst, I'm noting that the problem seems to involve a \"jigsaw puzzle\" where the input is a scrambled arrangement of different colored rectangular blocks, and the output is a single, neatly constructed image. The background color is a constant \"8.\"\n\nI'm analyzing Example 1, where the input is a 12x20 grid. I start by identifying the distinct non-8 regions, which I'm calling \"patches.\" There's a 3x3 orange block, a larger orange block, a red/orange block, and a few other scattered areas. I look closely at the coordinates and try to \"read\" the values in the grid, but I make some initial mistakes in reading the comma-separated data. I carefully re-examine the text representation to pinpoint the location and color of each patch.\n\nAfter extracting the individual rectangular blocks (like a 3x3 piece or a 6x3 piece or a 7x5 piece), I begin to look for the pattern in the output (also a 12x20 grid). It appears that the output is constructed by putting the patches in the input together to form a larger rectangle that is filled with values. I determine that the output consists of a large rectangular area made of different colors with an 8 background.\n\nI try to match the values, specifically the edges of the patches to those of the values in the output. I also verify the dimensions of this rectangle. It looks like it is 11 cols wide and 7 rows high. Then, I observe the content is the merging or putting together of the smaller patches.  I analyze if the patches overlap, or how the edges are connected.\n\nI start to construct a kind of logic about how the individual values or pixels are composed of the sub-rectangles or blocks.\n\nI identify that the process is like a \"puzzle.\" I need to find the puzzle pieces, and then fit them to construct a large rectangle, where touching borders have the same color. It's essentially like a \"edge-matching\" game.\n\nI look at Example 2, this one with a 10x10 grid. Again, I analyze this example to confirm the pattern is the same and the algorithm to reconstruct the image. The same jigsaw puzzle strategy is used here. However, I note that, in Example 2, some blocks (specifically, areas with the number \"4\") seem to be disregarded or ignored. They don't appear in the final output. This makes me suspect the rule might be to only include pieces with the same number of rows and columns, or maybe, it's just something that's connected to only the \"main\" colors (in this case 3 and 9).\n\nI'm starting to formalize a set of rules for the puzzle:\n\n1.  Identify the distinct rectangular non-background areas in the input.\n2.  Treat these as puzzle pieces.\n3.  Assemble these pieces into a larger rectangle.\n4.  Edge-matching is crucial; adjacent edges must have identical color (pixel value).\n5.  Discard pieces that do not fit the main assembly, particularly those with unique colors.\n\nI decide to apply this logic to the test input (a 20x20 grid). I carefully identify each patch and its location and content. I find pieces, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6. I use the edge-matching rule, and stack P2 (with a P6 on top) to create a new P26.\n\nI extract edges of the pieces to get the correct pattern or sequence to build the final shape. Then, I arrange these pieces. I decide the size of my output and placement of pieces on the 20x20 grid by trying to follow the pattern shown in Example 1 and Example 2 to keep the output centered. I determine that the shape will be 16x7. I consider 7 to be my top starting row to create a reasonable output that is centered with padding on top and padding on bottom. I then construct the values of the final image.\n\nI triple check the final placement. I verify that this matches the \"edge matching\" rule. The final assembled image is made of the correct combination of the pieces and the right pixel values. The output must be 20x20 with 8s as the background and the pixels of the assembled image in the correct grid locations.\n\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing scattered rectangular \"pieces\" of an image into a single, coherent rectangular image. The background color is 8 (Teal). The pieces are fragments of a larger pattern that have been separated. Our task is to reassemble them.\n\n**Methodology:**\n1.  **Identify Pieces:** Locate all contiguous rectangular regions of non-background colors (non-8). In the test input, there are several such pieces composed primarily of Maroon (9) and Green (3).\n2.  **Filter Noise:** Observe from the examples that small isolated pieces or colors that don't fit the main pattern (like the \"4\"s in the examples) are discarded. In the test input, there is a small \"4 4\" patch which we will treat as noise.\n3.  **Determine Arrangement:** Analyze the edges of the pieces. The rule for assembly, inferred from the examples, is that adjacent pieces must share a matching pattern along their touching borders (e.g., the right column of the left piece must match the left column of the right piece, and the bottom row of the top piece must match the top row of the bottom piece).\n4.  **Assemble:**\n    *   **P3** (Leftmost, 3x7): Extracted from Cols 0-2, Rows 3-9.\n    *   **P1** (Second, 4x7): Extracted from Cols 6-9, Rows 1-7.\n    *   **P4** (Third, 3x7): Extracted from Cols 13-15, Rows 8-14.\n    *   **P5** (Fourth, 3x7): Extracted from Cols 3-5, Rows 13-19.\n    *   **P26** (Rightmost, 3x7): Formed by stacking **P2** (Cols 15-17, Rows 2-5) on top of **P6** (Cols 11-13, Rows 17-19). P2 is 3x4 and P6 is 3x3, creating a 3x7 block.\n    *   **Edge Matching:**\n        *   Right of P3 (`9393939`) matches Left of P1 (`9393939`).\n        *   Right of P1 (`9993399`) matches Left of P4 (`9993399`).\n        *   Right of P4 (`9939939`) matches Left of P5 (`9939939`).\n        *   Right of P5 (`9933339`) matches Left of P26 (`9933339`).\n    *   The total assembled image is 16 columns wide (3+4+3+3+3) and 7 rows high.\n5.  **Placement:** Center the assembled 16x7 image in the 20x20 output grid. A height of 7 in a grid of 20 leaves 13 rows of padding. Based on Example 1, we apply a slight bias to the top padding (7 rows top, 6 rows bottom). Width 16 in grid 20 leaves 4 cols padding (2 left, 2 right).\n\n**Assembled Image Construction (Row by Row):**\n*   **Row 0:** All 9s.\n*   **Row 1:** 933 + 3399 + 999 + 939 + 939 -> `9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9`\n*   **Row 2:** 939 + 9399 + 933 + 333 + 339 -> `9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9`\n*   **Row 3:** 933 + 3333 + 339 + 933 + 339 -> `9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9`\n*   **Row 4:** 939 + 9333 + 339 + 933 + 339 -> `9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9`\n*   **Row 5:** 933 + 3399 + 933 + 333 + 339 -> `9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9`\n*   **Row 6:** All 9s.\n\nThe image is placed starting at Row 7, Column 2.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My thought process here is quite involved, so buckle up!** I'm tasked with generating a solution for an ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) problem, and I've been given a few examples to work with. My goal is to synthesize the essence of the problem, identify the underlying logic, and apply it to a new input.\n\nFirstly, I'm diving into an example, scrutinizing the structure of the input grid. I'm focusing on identifying distinct \"objects\" or patterns, noting their shapes, colors, and spatial relationships. I list the relevant pieces, making sure to track the x/y positions and the different elements within each piece. I'm building a mental model of the input.\n\nThen I switch my perspective. I examine the corresponding *output* to see how it relates to the input. The output grid shows a new, perhaps simpler, arrangement of pixels. It seems the input is a collection of fragmented parts that compose a whole, and the output is the resulting consolidated image. The colors are 7, 0, and 2, and the background is 8 (teal color). I think of the output as a reconstructed or merged version of the input fragments.\n\nI formulate a hypothesis: The input provides \"shards\" (partial views) of a target image, and the objective is to piece them together to form the complete image. I make a note of the overall size and the various elements and their coordinates in the input.\n\nI continue analyzing the first example, precisely identifying the specific fragments and their contents, mapping them to the expected output. I'm making very careful observations to identify the relationships, so I can generalize. I'm using the dimensions to look for correspondence.\n\nAfter I go through the input/output pattern many times and get familiar with the elements, I'm starting to zero in. I've begun to break down each input shard, so I can match it to the output. I am confident that I need to find the specific patterns from the output inside the input pieces. I'm examining dimensions, looking at how the pixels align row-by-row, looking at all the individual grid elements to find how they relate to the output.\n\nI'm identifying two key components: a \"Left\" fragment, and a \"Right\" fragment that fit into an image. I've found a way to concatenate them and verify their correspondence with the output. I'm thinking of the transformation as a horizontal merge of \"Left\" and \"Right\" parts.\n\nI move onto Example 2, which helps reinforce my understanding. I'm identifying the input pieces again, and I'm looking at how they map to the output. Example 2 confirms that I'm supposed to ignore certain colors, which are merely \"noise\". The focus is on the colors 3 and 9. It seems like the solution is a rectangular block, and there are many input elements that are just \"noise\".\n\nI've learned to disregard certain elements within the input. I have a more abstract idea of how the elements are combined. I'm looking for the spatial relationships. I see how one or two elements correspond to one side, which is why I call them \"quadrants\" or \"sides.\" I'm looking for specific \"Left\" or \"Right\" quadrants.\n\nI return to Example 1 with a renewed perspective. I'm looking at the shards and seeing if they can be combined to form the complete picture. The key is to examine the contents and positions of these shards. I'm looking to apply the concept of shards to the current input.\n\nI'm starting to think about horizontal flip or mirroring. However, Example 1 doesn't seem to have the mirror logic. It's more about merging \"left\" and \"right\" parts.\n\nI've begun considering connected components. I'm looking for the larger patterns within the input grid, the ones that are joined together. I'm looking for the most complete fragments to map to.\n\nI'm focusing my attention on Example 2 and the way the \"Left\" and \"Right\" sides are constructed. The second example helps give me hints.\n\nI'm switching to the test input. I start enumerating the various objects or shards within the grid. I'm attempting to extract a \"left stack\" and a few \"right shards\". I'm attempting to extract a \"right half\" to see if I can construct the image. I realize there might be some corruption in the data.\n\nI'm seeing that, generally, if the input is corrupted and doesn't exactly match the pattern, it may still be possible to assemble the output with the closest pieces.\n\nI see that the \"Left Stack\" is complete, and I identify it.\n\nI see that there is a \"right side\", but it is imperfect. I'm thinking about \"repairing\" the imperfect shard on the right.\n\nI\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a complete image from \"shards\" or fragments scattered in the input grid. The input grid contains a background color (8) and various pieces of the target object.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains a \"Left Half\" stack at columns 1-6 (rows 4-10) and a \"Top-Right\" fragment at columns 9-14. Other fragments exist but are less coherent.\n    *   **Output:** A single coherent object of size 7x11.\n    *   **Logic:** The object is assembled by joining the Left Half and the Right Half. The Left Half is taken from the large stack. The Right Half is reconstructed from the fragments. In this case, the pieces are merged with a 1-column overlap (Left width 6 + Right width 6 - 1 = 11). The position of the output object is shifted, but the internal structure suggests a merger of parts.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains a \"Left Half\" component (rows 3-4, cols 2-4) and a \"Right Half\" component (rows 1-3, cols 6-8). The Left Half corresponds to the left side of the output, and the Right Half to the right side.\n    *   **Output:** A single 6x6 object.\n    *   **Logic:** The Left Half (width 3) and Right Half (width 3) are joined side-by-side (Overlap 0) to form a width 6 object. The position of the output object aligns with the position of the Left Half in the input. Notably, the Right Half is the horizontal mirror image of the Left Half.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n*   **Left Stack:** There is a clearly defined stack on the left side (Rows 3-9, Cols 0-2).\n    *   Height: 7 rows.\n    *   Width: 3 columns.\n    *   Content Pattern:\n        *   Row 3: `9, 9, 9` (Top Border)\n        *   Row 4: `9, 3, 3`\n        *   Row 5: `9, 3, 9`\n        *   Row 6: `9, 3, 3`\n        *   Row 7: `9, 3, 9`\n        *   Row 8: `9, 3, 3`\n        *   Row 9: `9, 9, 9` (Bottom Border)\n*   **Right Shards:** There are fragments on the right side, particularly a large stack at Cols 6-9 (Rows 1-7). Comparing this stack to the Left Stack reveals it is a corrupted version of the horizontal mirror of the Left Stack. For example, Row 2 of this shard (`3, 3, 9, 9`) corresponds to the mirror of the Left Stack's `9, 3, 3` row (which is `3, 3, 9`), plus some noise.\n*   **Reconstruction Strategy:** Based on Example 2's symmetry and the alternating pattern in the Left Stack (`933` vs `939`), the correct transformation is to generate the Right Half as the horizontal mirror of the Left Half and join them.\n    *   Left Width: 3. Right Width: 3. Total Width: 6.\n    *   The Left Stack is located at (Row 3, Col 0). The Output Object will be placed at this anchor position.\n\n**Building the Output:**\nThe object is 7 rows high and 6 columns wide. We construct it row by row:\n1.  **Row 0 (Input Row 3):** Left `9,9,9` + Mirror `9,9,9` -> `9,9,9,9,9,9`\n2.  **Row 1 (Input Row 4):** Left `9,3,3` + Mirror `3,3,9` -> `9,3,3,3,3,9`\n3.  **Row 2 (Input Row 5):** Left `9,3,9` + Mirror `9,3,9` -> `9,3,9,9,3,9`\n4.  **Row 3 (Input Row 6):** Left `9,3,3` + Mirror `3,3,9` -> `9,3,3,3,3,9`\n5.  **Row 4 (Input Row 7):** Left `9,3,9` + Mirror `9,3,9` -> `9,3,9,9,3,9`\n6.  **Row 5 (Input Row 8):** Left `9,3,3` + Mirror `3,3,9` -> `9,3,3,3,3,9`\n7.  **Row 6 (Input Row 9):** Left `9,9,9` + Mirror `9,9,9` -> `9,9,9,9,9,9`\n\nThe background is filled with 8s. The object is placed at Rows 3-9, Cols 0-5.\n\nOutput Grid:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (reconstructable procedure)\n\n1. **Background color** is the most common value: here it is **8**. The output grid is the same size as the input and is filled with this background except for one reconstructed figure.\n\n2. There is a **marker** made of color **4** that forms an **L-shape** occupying **three cells of a 2\u00d72 block**.  \n   - In the test input, the 2\u00d72 block at rows 2\u20133 and cols 18\u201319 contains three 4\u2019s, and the **missing corner** is at **(row 3, col 18)**.\n   - This **missing corner cell is the anchor** where a corner of the final assembled image must be placed.\n   - The marker indicates the assembled image must extend **away from the 4\u2019s**. Since the 4\u2019s are above/right of the missing cell (missing corner is bottom-left), the assembled image\u2019s **top-right corner** is placed at the anchor.\n\n3. The color at the anchor (row 3 col 18) is **9**, which acts as the **frame/border color** of the pieces to assemble. Ignore the marker color 4 entirely.\n\n4. Collect all **connected non-background, non-marker (\u22608,\u22604)** components; each forms a rectangular \u201ctile\u201d (piece).  \n   - Four tiles are full-height (7 rows) vertical strips.\n   - The right edge is made by stacking a **top-right tile** (border on top+right) and a **bottom-right tile** (border on bottom+right) to get a **7\u00d73** strip.\n\n5. **Order the vertical strips left-to-right** by matching the pattern on the **rightmost column of a strip** to the **leftmost column of another**. This forms a unique chain:\n   - left-border strip \u2192 next \u2192 next \u2192 next \u2192 right-border strip.\n\n6. **Concatenate** these strips horizontally to form a **7\u00d716** complete image.\n\n7. **Place** this 7\u00d716 image into the output grid (filled with 8\u2019s) so that its **top-right corner** is at the anchor **(3,18)**.  \n   Therefore, the image occupies **rows 3\u20139** and **cols 3\u201318** (1-indexed).\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8\n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

It forms a small **L-shape**; its purpose is to tell **where to place** the final assembled picture.\n\n2. **Extract the picture pieces**\n   - Ignore background (8) and the marker color (4).\n   - The remaining colored cells form several **separate rectangular tiles** (their bounding boxes contain no background).\n   - In the test, these tiles are made of colors **9** and **3**.\n\n3. **Make all tiles the same height (if needed)**\n   - The target height is the height shared by the \u201cfull\u201d tiles (here it is **7**).\n   - If a tile is split into a shorter top piece and a shorter bottom piece (heights **4** and **3** here), **stack them vertically** to get a full **7\u00d7\u2026** tile.\n\n4. **Assemble tiles left-to-right by matching edges**\n   - For each tile, compare its **right edge column** to other tiles\u2019 **left edge column**.\n   - Tiles are ordered so that the **right edge of one exactly matches the left edge of the next** (this creates a unique chain).\n   - Concatenate the tiles horizontally in that order to form one big rectangle.\n\n5. **Place the assembled rectangle using the marker**\n   - Find the **2\u00d72 bounding box** of the marker (color 4). The L-shape occupies 3 of those 4 cells.\n   - Take the **corner of that 2\u00d72 box diagonally opposite the L-corner** (the \u201cinner\u201d corner).\n   - Place the assembled rectangle so that the rectangle corner **nearest the marker** touches that corner.\n   - Here the marker is at the **top-right**, so the assembled picture is placed **down-left** of it.\n\n---\n\n### Completed output grid (20\u00d720)\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,3,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,8,8  \n8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",
