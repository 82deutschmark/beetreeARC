No paths collide, so all diagonals extend fully to the edge.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_C>\n<REASONING_MODEL_D model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find the \u201cemitter\u201d objects:**  \n   In every example, the objects that *emit* a drawn path are the **3\u2011cell L-shapes** (a 2\u00d72 block with one missing corner).  \n   Each such L-shape has a unique **corner cell** (the one touching the other two cells orthogonally).\n\n2. **Launch a 45\u00b0 diagonal \u201cray\u201d from the corner into the empty quadrant:**  \n   The L-shape has two arms; the ray starts from the corner and goes diagonally **away from the arms** (into the missing quadrant).  \n   The ray\u2019s initial color is the L-shape\u2019s color.\n\n3. **Ray motion and turning (bouncing) rule:**  \n   The ray moves one step at a time in its current diagonal direction `(dr, dc)` where `dr,dc \u2208 {\u00b11}`.\n   After stepping into a new cell, look at the two **orthogonal neighbor cells in the ray\u2019s forward directions**:\n   - vertical forward neighbor: `(r+dr, c)`\n   - horizontal forward neighbor: `(r, c+dc)`\n   \n   If either of those contains a **non\u2011zero input pixel**, the ray \u201cbounces\u201d off it:\n   - If the horizontal neighbor is non-zero \u2192 flip `dc`.\n   - If the vertical neighbor is non-zero \u2192 flip `dr`.\n   - The ray\u2019s **current color becomes that neighbor\u2019s color**.\n   - The **turning cell** (the current cell) is colored with this (possibly new) color.\n\n4. **Stopping:**  \n   The ray continues until the next diagonal step would leave the grid.\n\n5. **Output:**  \n   The output is the original grid plus all ray-traced cells from all L-shaped emitters.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\nThe test grid contains **four 3\u2011cell L-shapes** (at the four corners), so we trace **four rays**.  \nEach ray bounces once off the nearest vertical bar it encounters and then exits at an edge.  \nCombining all rays with the unchanged original pixels yields the grid below.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_D>\n<REASONING_MODEL_E model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nThe outputs can be explained as **ray-tracing on the grid along 45\u00b0 diagonals**:\n\n1. **Keep all input pixels in place** (no moving/recoloring of existing objects).\n2. Treat certain input objects as **\u201cnodes\u201d hit by a ray**. The ray moves only on diagonals (slope \u00b11).\n3. When a ray is travelling, it **paints every visited empty cell** with the ray\u2019s current color.\n4. A ray **does not enter** an occupied cell. Instead, if the **next diagonal step** would land on a non\u2011zero cell, the ray:\n   - **reflects** (turns) depending on the hit object\u2019s orientation:\n     - hitting a **vertical bar** reflects left\u2194right (flip the column direction),\n     - hitting a **horizontal bar** reflects up\u2194down (flip the row direction).\n   - continues from the current cell in the new diagonal direction.\n5. The behavior in the examples is constructive and produces large diagonal runs; with multiple border components, you get multiple diagonal \u201carms\u201d.\n\nFor the test grid, the only meaningful reflectors are the **vertical 3\u2011pixel bars** (at columns 8 and 10). The corner L-shapes sit on the border and act as starting \u201csources\u201d; each launches a diagonal ray inward, which then reflects off the nearest vertical bar, creating the long zigzagging diagonals seen in the examples.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0  \n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6  \n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0  \n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \n6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7  \n0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0  \n0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,7,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0  \n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0  \n0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0  \n7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6  \n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0  \n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7  \n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_E>\n<REASONING_MODEL_F model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_F>\n<REASONING_MODEL_G model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_8_step_5_image\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find the \u201csources\u201d: L-shaped corners**\n   - A source is a 3-cell L shape of one color (the corner cell has **two** orthogonal neighbors of the same color).\n   - Each source emits a single diagonal \u201cray\u201d starting from its **corner cell**.\n\n2. **Initial ray direction = into the missing quadrant of the L**\n   - Look at the two directions where the L has its arms (e.g. up+left).\n   - The ray goes diagonally into the opposite/missing quadrant (e.g. down+right).\n\n3. **Ray motion and painting**\n   - The ray advances **one cell diagonally** each step and paints its path with its current color.\n\n4. **Reflection rule (key idea)**\n   - The ray reflects when it becomes **orthogonally adjacent in its travel direction** to any non-zero input cell:\n     - If moving `(dr, dc)`, check:\n       - the cell one step vertically forward: `(r+dr, c)`\n       - the cell one step horizontally forward: `(r, c+dc)`\n     - If `(r+dr, c)` is non-zero \u21d2 reflect on a **horizontal mirror**: flip `dr`.\n     - If `(r, c+dc)` is non-zero \u21d2 reflect on a **vertical mirror**: flip `dc`.\n     - The ray\u2019s **color becomes the color of the mirror cell**, and the **current ray cell** is recolored to that mirror color.\n   - The ray then continues from the same cell in the new direction.\n   - The ray stops when the next diagonal step would leave the grid.\n\n5. **Output**\n   - Keep all original input pixels.\n   - Add all painted ray paths.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\nThere are four L-shaped sources (two of color 7, two of color 6) in the corners.

The ray continues through background (0) **until it would enter a non-zero cell**, and then **stops just before** that occupied cell (so it never overwrites existing colored cells).\n\nThis is exactly what happens in Example 3 with the 3-cell L of color 4 at the top-left: it emits a SE diagonal from its elbow and stops when it reaches another structure.\n\n---\n\n### Applying the rule to the test input\n\nThe test grid contains four 3-cell L-shapes at the four corners:\n\n- **Top-left (color 7)**: missing the top-left corner \u21d2 ray goes **SE** from the elbow at (1,1).\n  - It stops before hitting the existing 7 at (8,8).\n  - So we fill: (2,2)\u2026(7,7) with 7.\n\n- **Top-right (color 6)**: missing the top-right corner \u21d2 ray goes **SW** from the elbow at (1,17).\n  - It stops before hitting the existing 6 at (8,10).\n  - So we fill: (2,16)\u2026(7,11) with 6.\n\n- **Bottom-left (color 6)**: missing the bottom-left corner \u21d2 ray goes **NE** from the elbow at (18,1).\n  - It stops before hitting the existing 6 at (11,8).\n  - So we fill: (17,2)\u2026(12,7) with 6.\n\n- **Bottom-right (color 7)**: missing the bottom-right corner \u21d2 ray goes **NW** from the elbow at (18,17).\n  - It stops before hitting the existing 7 at (11,10).\n  - So we fill: (17,16)\u2026(12,11) with 7.\n\nAll original cells remain unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Completed output grid\n\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0  \n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6  \n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0  \n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0  \n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7  \n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_3_step_3\">\n### Inferred transformation (reconstructable rules)\n\nThe grids contain small **3-cell components** in two main shapes:\n\n1) **Straight line of length 3** (either 3\u00d71 vertical or 1\u00d73 horizontal).  \n2) **L-shape of 3 cells** (a 2\u00d72 block with one corner missing).\n\nThe output is produced by **shooting 45\u00b0 diagonal \u201crays\u201d** from these components.\n\n#### A) Rays from straight 3-cell lines (when there are two lines of the same color)\nIf a color has **two separate straight length\u20113 line components**:\n\n1.

Analyzing the examples, I see a pattern of extending lines from objects (L-shapes, bars, dots) until they reach a boundary or another line.\n\n**Key Observations and Insights:**\n\n*   **Color-Based Connections:** Lines predominantly connect objects of the same color.\n*   **Diagonal Lines:** The lines are frequently diagonal, with slopes of either 1 or -1.\n*   **\"Bouncing\" Behavior (in some examples):** Lines may not directly connect but appear to bounce off a central point, forming a \"V\" shape, or zig-zag through.\n*   **Starting Point:** Lines originate from a specific point of the shape, often the \"corner\" (like the bottom-right for an L-shape) or an endpoint of a bar.\n*   **\"Targeting\" Logic:**  It seems lines are \"aimed\" toward another same color object.\n*   **Example-Specific Analysis:**  I'm taking each example's input, observing it with detail, making and testing hypothesis:\n\n    *   **Example 1 (Basic Connection):** Lines extend from L-shapes diagonally towards a dot, bouncing off the dots column to create V-shaped patterns. It appears the lines intersect or \"bounce\" off an invisible central line.\n    *   **Example 2 (Complex Chain):** Lines extend from bars and connect them, often through a zigzag.\n    *   **Example 3 (Object Blocking):** Lines from L-shapes seem to stop or divert when encountering an object.\n\n**Hypotheses & Refinements:**\n\n*   **Object Type:** Different objects require different extension points, with corners of L-shapes being important.\n*   **Targeting Logic is Essential:** The output is constructed around what object the path is going towards.\n*   **Central Lines:** Maybe all paths use the center column as a central pivot point.\n*   **Side Wall Bounces are Likely:** If all lines share the same center, they can't all fit. Some should connect to side walls to prevent overwrites.\n*   **No Line Overwrite:** Since they are integers, one shape cannot overwrite another. If this happens, a new path must be created to avoid this.\n\n**Approach for Test Input (and Beyond):**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Determine the locations and colors of all the objects (L-shapes, bars).\n2.  **Establish Connections:** Figure the rules for which objects connect (same color).\n3.  **Trace Lines:** From the L-shapes, I extend lines based on the geometry of the input grid and look for the connections.\n4.  **Bouncing Logic:** If I find a place where objects connect by bouncing, I apply this to my rules.\n5.  **Output:** Fill the grid with the extended lines, taking into account any collisions or overlaps.\n\n\nThe objective of this task is to connect colored shapes using diagonal lines. Based on the solved examples, the pattern is:\n1.  **Identify Source and Target Objects**:\n    *   In Example 1, L-shapes on the left connect to single pixels on the right.\n    *   In Example 2, shapes connect to form a chain.\n    *   In Example 3, L-shapes connect to bars.\n    *   The connection is always a diagonal line (slope 1 or -1).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule**:\n    *   Find the \"inner corner\" or the vertex of the L-shape that points towards the target.\n    *   Draw a diagonal line from that vertex towards the target object.\n    *   The line stops when it hits the target object.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\nThe input has a 180-degree rotational symmetry.\n*   **Orange Objects**:\n    *   Top-Left L-shape with corner at `(1,1)`.\n    *   Top-Center Vertical Bar ending at `(8,8)`.\n    *   Bottom-Center Vertical Bar starting at `(11,10)`.\n    *   Bottom-Right L-shape with corner at `(18,17)`.\n*   **Magenta Objects**:\n    *   Top-Right L-shape with corner at `(1,17)`.\n    *   Top-Center Vertical Bar ending at `(8,10)`.\n    *   Bottom-Center Vertical Bar starting at `(11,8)`.\n    *   Bottom-Left L-shape with corner at `(18,1)`.\n\n**Connections:**\n1.  **Top-Left Orange Path**:\n    *   Start at L-corner `(1,1)`.\n    *   Target is Top-Center Bar at `(8,8)`.\n    *   Path: `(2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7)`. The next pixel `(8,8)` is part of the bar.\n\n2.  **Bottom-Right Orange Path**:\n    *   Start at L-corner `(18,17)`.\n    *   Target is Bottom-Center Bar at `(11,10)`.\n    *   Path: `(17,16), (16,15), (15,14), (14,13), (13,12), (12,11)`. The next pixel `(11,10)` is part of the bar.\n\n3.  **Top-Right Magenta Path**:\n    *   Start at L-corner `(1,17)`.\n    *   Target is Top-Center Bar at `(8,10)`.\n    *   Path: `(2,16), (3,15), (4,14), (5,13), (6,12), (7,11)`. The next pixel `(8,10)` is part of the bar.\n\n4.  **Bottom-Left Magenta Path**:\n    *   Start at L-corner `(18,1)`.\n    *   Target is Bottom-Center Bar at `(11,8)`.\n    *   Path: `(17,2), (16,3), (15,4), (14,5), (13,6), (12,7)`. The next pixel `(11,8)` is part of the bar.\n\nThe central area between the bars (rows 9-10) is a potential crossing point. However, a direct diagonal bridge would cause a collision at `(9,9)` or `(10,9)`. Following the pattern of Example 3 where lines stop at the target, we only draw the lines connecting the L-shapes to the nearest bars.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_C>\n<REASONING_MODEL_D model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_7_step_5_image\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find each 3-cell \u201cL\u201d shaped corner object** (a 2\u00d72 block with exactly one missing cell).\n2.

<CANDIDATE id=\"3\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find the \u201cemitter\u201d objects**  \n   The emitters are the **3-cell L-shapes**: connected components of size 3 whose bounding box is **2\u00d72** (a 2\u00d72 square with exactly one missing corner).\n\n2. **Each emitter launches one diagonal \u201cray\u201d**\n   - Let the missing corner of the 2\u00d72 box be `(rm, cm)`.\n   - The ray **starts from the opposite (filled) corner** `(rs, cs)` (diagonally opposite the missing one).\n   - The initial direction is the diagonal step from missing to filled:\n     \\[\n     (dr, dc) = (rs-rm,\\; cs-cm) \\in \\{(-1,-1),(-1,1),(1,-1),(1,1)\\}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Ray propagation and reflection**\n   While the ray can continue inside the grid:\n   - Look one cell **ahead vertically**: `(r+dr, c)` and one cell **ahead horizontally**: `(r, c+dc)`.\n   - If either of those cells is non-zero, the ray **reflects**:\n     - If `(r+dr, c)` is non-zero, flip `dr := -dr` (bounce off a horizontal \u201cside\u201d).\n     - If `(r, c+dc)` is non-zero, flip `dc := -dc` (bounce off a vertical \u201cside\u201d).\n     - The ray\u2019s drawing color becomes the color of the blocking cell that caused the bounce (in these tests it happens to stay the same).\n   - If no bounce happens, advance to `(r+dr, c+dc)` and color that cell (unless it is already colored by the original picture).\n   - Stop when the next diagonal step would leave the grid.\n\n4. **Keep all original colored cells**; the output is the input plus all ray trails.\n\n---\n\n### Applying it to the test input\n\nThere are four 2\u00d72 L-shape emitters in the corners:\n\n- **Top-left (7)** emits down-right, bounces off the vertical 7 bar near the middle, then goes down-left to the left edge.\n- **Top-right (6)** emits down-left, bounces off the vertical 6 bar, then goes down-right to the right edge.\n- **Bottom-left (6)** emits up-right, bounces off the vertical 6 bar, then goes up-left to the left edge.\n- **Bottom-right (7)** emits up-left, bounces off the vertical 7 bar, then goes up-right to the right edge.\n\nThis produces the added diagonals shown below.\n\n---\n\n### Output

examples)\n\nThe non\u2011zero cells form a \u201claser / reflection\u201d system:\n\n1. **Find emitters:**  \n   An emitter is any **2\u00d72 block with exactly 3 cells of the same non\u2011zero color** (an L\u2011shape).  \n   The **corner** of the L is the cell in that 2\u00d72 opposite the missing cell (it has two orthogonal neighbors inside the L).\n\n2. **Initial ray direction:**  \n   Let the missing cell be diagonally adjacent to the corner.  \n   The ray starts **one step diagonally away from the missing cell** (i.e., from the corner, step in the diagonal direction opposite the missing cell).\n\n3. **Ray propagation:**  \n   Move one cell at a time in the current diagonal direction, painting visited background cells with the ray\u2019s current color.\n\n4. **Reflection / color change:**  \n   When the ray enters a cell that is **orthogonally adjacent (N/S/E/W)** to any original non\u2011zero cell, it \u201chits\u201d that neighbor:\n   - The ray\u2019s **color becomes the neighbor\u2019s color**.\n   - The ray **reflects** by flipping the direction component perpendicular to the side touched:\n     - neighbor is **left/right** \u2192 flip horizontal component (dc)\n     - neighbor is **up/down** \u2192 flip vertical component (dr)\n   - The hit cell (the cell the ray just entered) is painted with the **new** color.\n\n5. **Stop condition:**  \n   The ray stops when the next step would go out of bounds.\n\n6. **Output:**  \n   The output is the original grid plus all painted ray paths from all emitters.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\nThere are four L\u2011shape emitters in the corners (two 7\u2019s and two 6\u2019s).  \nEach emits a diagonal ray inward, reflects once off the nearby vertical triplet of the same color, and exits the

\u201cemitters\u201d and \u201cmirrors\u201d for 45\u00b0 diagonal rays; we **never move or erase** existing pixels, we only **add** new ones on 0-cells.\n\n1. **L-shape (3 pixels in a 2\u00d72 block)**  \n   - Find its **elbow** (the pixel with two orthogonal neighbors).\n   - Determine the **missing corner** of the 2\u00d72.\n   - From the elbow, the L-shape **emits a diagonal ray** in the direction **opposite** the missing corner (NW/NE/SW/SE).\n   - The ray fills empty cells until it is about to reach the next \u201cmirror junction\u201d (see below).\n\n2. **Length\u20113 straight segment (horizontal or vertical) = mirror**  \n   When a ray is going to hit an **endpoint** of a straight segment, we form a **junction** at the cell **just before** the hit (on the ray\u2019s diagonal path).  \n   That junction cell is colored with the **segment\u2019s color**, so the incoming ray stops **one cell earlier** (as in the examples\u2019 color handoffs).\n\n   Then the segment emits its own diagonal:\n   - It emits from the **opposite endpoint** (the far end of the length\u20113 segment).\n   - The direction is the **reflection** of the incoming diagonal:\n     - **Vertical segment:** flip left/right (NE\u2194NW, SE\u2194SW).\n     - **Horizontal segment:** flip up/down (NE\u2194SE, NW\u2194SW).\n   - It continues until the next step would leave the grid or hit a non\u2011zero cell.\n\n### Applying to the test grid\n\nThere are four corner **L-shapes** (two 7s, two 6s) and four central **vertical length\u20113 segments**.  \nEach corner L-shape\u2019s emitted diagonal reaches the nearest same\u2011colored vertical segment endpoint; that segment reflects the ray horizontally (because it\u2019s vertical) and emits the outgoing diagonal to the boundary. No paths collide, so all diagonals extend fully to the edge.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n      7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n      0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n      0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n      6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7\n      0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0\n      0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n      0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,7,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0\n      0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n      0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0\n      7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6\n      0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n      0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n      6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n      0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"D\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find the \u201cemitter\u201d objects:**  \n   In every example, the objects that *emit* a drawn path are the **3\u2011cell L-shapes** (a 2\u00d72 block with one missing corner).  \n   Each such L-shape has a unique **corner cell** (the one touching the other two cells orthogonally).\n\n2. **Launch a 45\u00b0 diagonal \u201cray\u201d from the corner into the empty quadrant:**  \n   The L-shape has two arms;

Treat certain input objects as **\u201cnodes\u201d hit by a ray**. The ray moves only on diagonals (slope \u00b11).\n3. When a ray is travelling, it **paints every visited empty cell** with the ray\u2019s current color.\n4. A ray **does not enter** an occupied cell. Instead, if the **next diagonal step** would land on a non\u2011zero cell, the ray:\n   - **reflects** (turns) depending on the hit object\u2019s orientation:\n     - hitting a **vertical bar** reflects left\u2194right (flip the column direction),\n     - hitting a **horizontal bar** reflects up\u2194down (flip the row direction).\n   - continues from the current cell in the new diagonal direction.\n5.

The corner L-shapes sit on the border and act as starting \u201csources\u201d; each launches a diagonal ray inward, which then reflects off the nearest vertical bar, creating the long zigzagging diagonals seen in the examples.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0  \n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6  \n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0  \n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \n6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7  \n0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0  \n0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,7,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0  \n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0  \n0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0  \n7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6  \n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0  \n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7  \n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n      7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n      0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n      0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n      6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7\n      0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0\n      0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n      0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,7,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0\n      0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n      0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0\n      7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6\n      0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n      0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n      6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n      0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"F\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n      7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n      0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n      0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n      6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7\n      0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0\n      0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n      0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,7,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0\n      0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n      0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0\n      7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6\n      0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n      0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n      6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n      0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"G\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_8_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find the \u201csources\u201d: L-shaped corners**\n   - A source is a 3-cell L shape of one color (the corner cell has **two** orthogonal neighbors of the same color).\n   - Each source emits a single diagonal \u201cray\u201d starting from its **corner cell**.\n\n2. **Initial ray direction = into the missing quadrant of the L**\n   - Look at the two directions where the L has its arms (e.g. up+left).\n   - The ray goes diagonally into the opposite/missing quadrant (e.g. down+right).\n\n3. **Ray motion and painting**\n   - The ray advances **one cell diagonally** each step and paints its path with its current color.\n\n4. **Reflection rule (key idea)**\n   - The ray reflects when it becomes **orthogonally adjacent in its travel direction** to any non-zero input cell:\n     - If moving `(dr, dc)`, check:\n       - the cell one step vertically forward: `(r+dr, c)`\n       - the cell one step horizontally forward: `(r, c+dc)`\n     - If `(r+dr, c)` is non-zero \u21d2 reflect on a **horizontal mirror**: flip `dr`.\n     - If `(r, c+dc)` is non-zero \u21d2 reflect on a **vertical mirror**: flip `dc`.\n     - The ray\u2019s **color becomes the color of the mirror cell**, and the **current ray cell** is recolored to that mirror color.\n   - The ray then continues from the same cell in the new direction.\n   - The ray stops when the next diagonal step would leave the grid.\n\n5. **Output**\n   - Keep all original input pixels.\n   - Add all painted ray paths.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\nThere are four L-shaped sources (two of color 7, two of color 6) in the corners.

The ray continues through background (0) **until it would enter a non-zero cell**, and then **stops just before** that occupied cell (so it never overwrites existing colored cells).\n\nThis is exactly what happens in Example 3 with the 3-cell L of color 4 at the top-left: it emits a SE diagonal from its elbow and stops when it reaches another structure.\n\n---\n\n### Applying the rule to the test input\n\nThe test grid contains four 3-cell L-shapes at the four corners:\n\n- **Top-left (color 7)**: missing the top-left corner \u21d2 ray goes **SE** from the elbow at (1,1).\n  - It stops before hitting the existing 7 at (8,8).\n  - So we fill: (2,2)\u2026(7,7) with 7.\n\n- **Top-right (color 6)**: missing the top-right corner \u21d2 ray goes **SW** from the elbow at (1,17).\n  - It stops before hitting the existing 6 at (8,10).\n  - So we fill: (2,16)\u2026(7,11) with 6.\n\n- **Bottom-left (color 6)**: missing the bottom-left corner \u21d2 ray goes **NE** from the elbow at (18,1).\n  - It stops before hitting the existing 6 at (11,8).\n  - So we fill: (17,2)\u2026(12,7) with 6.\n\n- **Bottom-right (color 7)**: missing the bottom-right corner \u21d2 ray goes **NW** from the elbow at (18,17).\n  - It stops before hitting the existing 7 at (11,10).\n  - So we fill: (17,16)\u2026(12,11) with 7.\n\nAll original cells remain unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Completed output grid\n\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0  \n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6  \n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0  \n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0  \n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7  \n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n      7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n      0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n      0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n      0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n      6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n      0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_3_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (reconstructable rules)\n\nThe grids contain small **3-cell components** in two main shapes:\n\n1) **Straight line of length 3** (either 3\u00d71 vertical or 1\u00d73 horizontal).  \n2) **L-shape of 3 cells** (a 2\u00d72 block with one corner missing).\n\nThe output is produced by **shooting 45\u00b0 diagonal \u201crays\u201d** from these components.\n\n#### A) Rays from straight 3-cell lines (when there are two lines of the same color)\nIf a color has **two separate straight length\u20113 line components**:\n\n1.

Analyzing the examples, I see a pattern of extending lines from objects (L-shapes, bars, dots) until they reach a boundary or another line.\n\n**Key Observations and Insights:**\n\n*   **Color-Based Connections:** Lines predominantly connect objects of the same color.\n*   **Diagonal Lines:** The lines are frequently diagonal, with slopes of either 1 or -1.\n*   **\"Bouncing\" Behavior (in some examples):** Lines may not directly connect but appear to bounce off a central point, forming a \"V\" shape, or zig-zag through.\n*   **Starting Point:** Lines originate from a specific point of the shape, often the \"corner\" (like the bottom-right for an L-shape) or an endpoint of a bar.\n*   **\"Targeting\" Logic:**  It seems lines are \"aimed\" toward another same color object.\n*   **Example-Specific Analysis:**  I'm taking each example's input, observing it with detail, making and testing hypothesis:\n\n    *   **Example 1 (Basic Connection):** Lines extend from L-shapes diagonally towards a dot, bouncing off the dots column to create V-shaped patterns. It appears the lines intersect or \"bounce\" off an invisible central line.\n    *   **Example 2 (Complex Chain):** Lines extend from bars and connect them, often through a zigzag.\n    *   **Example 3 (Object Blocking):** Lines from L-shapes seem to stop or divert when encountering an object.\n\n**Hypotheses & Refinements:**\n\n*   **Object Type:** Different objects require different extension points, with corners of L-shapes being important.\n*   **Targeting Logic is Essential:** The output is constructed around what object the path is going towards.\n*   **Central Lines:** Maybe all paths use the center column as a central pivot point.\n*   **Side Wall Bounces are Likely:** If all lines share the same center, they can't all fit. Some should connect to side walls to prevent overwrites.\n*   **No Line Overwrite:** Since they are integers, one shape cannot overwrite another. If this happens, a new path must be created to avoid this.\n\n**Approach for Test Input (and Beyond):**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Determine the locations and colors of all the objects (L-shapes, bars).\n2.  **Establish Connections:** Figure the rules for which objects connect (same color).\n3.  **Trace Lines:** From the L-shapes, I extend lines based on the geometry of the input grid and look for the connections.\n4.  **Bouncing Logic:** If I find a place where objects connect by bouncing, I apply this to my rules.\n5.  **Output:** Fill the grid with the extended lines, taking into account any collisions or overlaps.\n\n\nThe objective of this task is to connect colored shapes using diagonal lines. Based on the solved examples, the pattern is:\n1.  **Identify Source and Target Objects**:\n    *   In Example 1, L-shapes on the left connect to single pixels on the right.\n    *   In Example 2, shapes connect to form a chain.\n    *   In Example 3, L-shapes connect to bars.\n    *   The connection is always a diagonal line (slope 1 or -1).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule**:\n    *   Find the \"inner corner\" or the vertex of the L-shape that points towards the target.\n    *   Draw a diagonal line from that vertex towards the target object.\n    *   The line stops when it hits the target object.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\nThe input has a 180-degree rotational symmetry.\n*   **Orange Objects**:\n    *   Top-Left L-shape with corner at `(1,1)`.\n    *   Top-Center Vertical Bar ending at `(8,8)`.\n    *   Bottom-Center Vertical Bar starting at `(11,10)`.\n    *   Bottom-Right L-shape with corner at `(18,17)`.\n*   **Magenta Objects**:\n    *   Top-Right L-shape with corner at `(1,17)`.\n    *   Top-Center Vertical Bar ending at `(8,10)`.\n    *   Bottom-Center Vertical Bar starting at `(11,8)`.\n    *   Bottom-Left L-shape with corner at `(18,1)`.\n\n**Connections:**\n1.  **Top-Left Orange Path**:\n    *   Start at L-corner `(1,1)`.\n    *   Target is Top-Center Bar at `(8,8)`.\n    *   Path: `(2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7)`. The next pixel `(8,8)` is part of the bar.\n\n2.  **Bottom-Right Orange Path**:\n    *   Start at L-corner `(18,17)`.\n    *   Target is Bottom-Center Bar at `(11,10)`.\n    *   Path: `(17,16), (16,15), (15,14), (14,13), (13,12), (12,11)`. The next pixel `(11,10)` is part of the bar.\n\n3.  **Top-Right Magenta Path**:\n    *   Start at L-corner `(1,17)`.\n    *   Target is Top-Center Bar at `(8,10)`.\n    *   Path: `(2,16), (3,15), (4,14), (5,13), (6,12), (7,11)`. The next pixel `(8,10)` is part of the bar.\n\n4.  **Bottom-Left Magenta Path**:\n    *   Start at L-corner `(18,1)`.\n    *   Target is Bottom-Center Bar at `(11,8)`.\n    *   Path: `(17,2), (16,3), (15,4), (14,5), (13,6), (12,7)`. The next pixel `(11,8)` is part of the bar.\n\nThe central area between the bars (rows 9-10) is a potential crossing point. However, a direct diagonal bridge would cause a collision at `(9,9)` or `(10,9)`. Following the pattern of Example 3 where lines stop at the target, we only draw the lines connecting the L-shapes to the nearest bars.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n      7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n      0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n      0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n      0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n      6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n      0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"D\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_7_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find each 3-cell \u201cL\u201d shaped corner object** (a 2\u00d72 block with exactly one missing cell).\n2. For each such L-object, identify its **inner corner**: the cell of the L that touches the other two orthogonally (it has 2 orthogonal neighbors within the L).\n3. Determine the **missing corner** of that 2\u00d72.  \n   The L \u201cpoints\u201d **away from the missing corner** (i.e., from the inner corner, go diagonally into the empty quadrant of the 2\u00d72).\n4. From the inner corner, **draw a 45\u00b0 diagonal ray** in that pointing direction, coloring all traversed empty cells with the L\u2019s color.\n5. **Stop the ray** when the next step would leave the grid or enter a non-zero cell (you do not overwrite existing colored cells).\n\nIn the test input there are four corner L-shapes (two 7s and two 6s). Each emits a diagonal inward; the rays stop when they reach the already-present central vertical bars of the same color.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n      7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n      0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n      0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n      0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n      6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n      0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- SELECT THE BEST RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1. It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1. Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
