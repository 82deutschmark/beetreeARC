        "Full raw LLM response": "**Understanding the ARC Task**\n\nI'm tasked with solving an ARC puzzle. The goal is to analyze the transformation between two example input-output pairs of 2D grids representing colored pixels and then apply that same transformation logic to a new test input grid. The input grids are 22x22, and the colors are represented by integers from 0 to 9.\n\n**Analysis of Example 1**\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the input and output in Example 1. The input is a 22x22 grid composed of distinct colored shapes, with a black (0) background. Each shape seems to be an identifiable \"object.\" I must carefully map out the coordinates of each object and identify their individual shapes and colors. Key to the transformation appears to be these \"objects,\" which include:\n\n1.  A claw-like shape (2s and 8s).\n2.  A rotated \"U\" or \"C\" shape (2s and 1s).\n3.  A 3x3 block of yellow (4s) with some red marks (2s).\n4.  A left-facing \"C\" shape (2s and 5s).\n5.  An inverted U shape (2s and 3s).\n\nThe Output grid appears to have the same objects, but they're rearranged in a stacked manner and possibly merged together. The red (2) pixels seem to be acting as key connector points. The arrangement seems to be:\n\n*   The green inverted-U shape is at the top.\n*   The claw-like shape is stacked below.\n*   The yellow block appears next.\n*   The rotated \"U\" is adjacent to the right side of the yellow block.\n*   The grey \"C\" is attached to the right side of the U-shape.\n\nI observed that the red pixels, or \"ports,\" play a role in connecting these objects in a structured way. Notably, the red pixels (2) from the bottom green shape were merged or attached to the claw-like shape.\n\nThe stacking order appears to be as follows: the green inverted-U shape (top, red \"ports\" at the bottom), then the claw-like shape (middle, red \"ports\" at the bottom), the yellow block with connections to the C and U shapes (below that, side-by-side).\n\n**Analyzing Example 2**\n\nI look at Example 2 and start by identifying all the objects and their relative positions. Similar to Example 1, a Teal (6) object is an upside-down U-Shape. I also detect:\n\n1.  A U shape of 1s with two red ports.\n2.  A Yellow (4) block.\n3.  A Green (3) object.\n4.  An Orange (7) Object.\n5.  A Teal (8) Object.\n\nThe output now has the Teal (6) object on top, with the Teal (8) object adjacent to it. Below them, side-by-side, are the U-shape (1) and Green (3) objects. The Yellow block connects to the U and Green blocks on either side.\n\nI realize the following:\n\n*   The Teal(6) connects to a larger 8-shaped block.\n*   The U-shape connects to Yellow, along with the Green block.\n*   I see red connection markers.\n*   The red markers indicate attachment points.\n\n**Deriving the Transformation Logic**\n\nBased on analyzing the examples, I've concluded the primary logic that governs this puzzle:\n\n1.  Break down the input grid into distinct \"parts\" or \"objects\" based on contiguous, non-zero colored pixels, often associated with red (2) pixels.\n2.  I define each \"part\" in terms of its shape, location, and the configuration of its red \"ports.\" The ports act as connection points, such as single pixels, pixel pairs, etc.\n3.  Find pairs of objects whose ports match geometrically. This matching often depends on the type of port and distance/orientation between them.\n    -   Top to bottom: match the bottom part of an object with the top part of another.\n    -   Side-by-side: Match the left of one with the right of another.\n4.  Construct the overall output image by assembling the parts according to these port-based connections.\n5.  I consider that the assembled images are centered in the output grid.\n\n**Applying the Logic to Test Input**\n\nI will now parse the test input based on what I have learned from the two examples.\n\n1.  Identify all \"parts\": I see a combination of shapes, including U-shapes (1) and Teal Objects (8). A yellow (4) object is present. A Maroon\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we need to infer a transformation from two examples and apply it to a test input. The task involves rearranging disjoint shapes (\"objects\") from the input grid into a single connected assembly in the output grid.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: Identify all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a cluster of colored pixels (1-9) along with associated red pixels (color 2).\n2.  **Port Identification**: The red pixels (2) serve as \"connection ports\". For each object, note the location and configuration (relative position, gap size) of its ports.\n    *   Example: A shape might have two red pixels with a gap of 1 space between them at the bottom.\n3.  **Connection Logic**: Find pairs of objects with matching port configurations. A connection is valid if the ports of one object (e.g., bottom ports) match the ports of another (e.g., top ports) in terms of spacing and orientation.\n    *   Vertical connections: Bottom ports of object A overlap with top ports of object B.\n    *   Horizontal connections: Right ports of A overlap with left ports of B.\n    *   The red pixels (2) are preserved at the overlap points in the final image.\n4.  **Assembly Graph**: Construct a connected graph of objects based on these matching ports. Determine the relative spatial offsets between connected objects.\n5.  **Grid Construction**: Assemble the objects into a single structure in the output grid.\n    *   Start with a central object (usually the yellow block) and place connected objects relative to it using the calculated offsets.\n    *   Center the entire assembly within the output grid dimensions.\n\n### Application to Test Input\n\n**1. Identify Objects & Ports:**\n*   **Yellow Block (4)**: Central 5x4 block.\n    *   Top-Left Port: (10,9) [Input coords].\n    *   Left Port: (14,8).\n    *   Right Port: (11,14).\n*   **Maroon Shape (9)**: Top-Left area.\n    *   Bottom Port: (9,4). Matches Yellow Top-Left (10,9).\n*   **Green Shape (3)**: Bottom-Left area.\n    *   Top-Right Port: (20,4). Matches Yellow Left (14,8).\n    *   (Input shape width implies shift).\n*   **Blue Shape (1)**: Top-Right \"A\" shape.\n    *   Bottom-Left Port: (14,18). Matches Yellow Right (11,14).\n    *   Bottom Ports: (14,18) and (14,23). Gap 4.\n    *   Right Port: (14,23).\n*   **Orange Shape (7)**: Bottom-Right bar.\n    *   Top Ports: (20,12) and (20,17). Gap 4. Match Blue Bottom (14,18) & (14,23).\n*   **Teal Right Shape (8)**: Top-Right \"C\" shape.\n    *   Left Port: (3,16). Matches Blue Right (14,23) after Blue is attached?\n    *   Wait, the port at (3,16) aligns with the Blue leg at (14,23) when assembled.\n*   **Teal Left Shape (8)**: Top-Left \"U\" shape.\n    *   Top Ports: (2,10), (2,12). Gap 1.\n    *   Connects to isolated connector ports found in input at (10,5), (10,7).\n\n**2. Assembly & Offsets:**\nUsing the Yellow block (Input pos 11,9) as the anchor (0,0):\n*   **Maroon**: Connects to top-left. Shift: `(-1, +2)` relative to final grid.\n*   **Green**: Connects to left. Shift: `(-8, +1)`.\n*   **Blue**: Connects to right. Shift: `(-5, -7)`.\n*   **Orange**: Connects to bottom of Blue. Shift: `(-11, -1)`.\n*   **Teal Right**: Connects to right of Blue. Shift: `(+6, 0)`.\n*   **Teal Left**: Connects to top connector strip. Shift: `(+6, -8)`.\n\n**3. Final Centering:**\nThe assembly spans approx rows 5-16 and cols 2-22.

        "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, here\u2019s my thought process on tackling this ARC puzzle. First, I\u2019m seeing a task involving assembling shapes based on connector pixels (red/2). The goal is to build a final image from scattered pieces.  Let\u2019s break this down.\n\n**Task Analysis:**  \n\nI see that the input consists of grids with colored shapes and red pixels. These red pixels appear to be the key. Example 1 shows pieces that are initially separate but connected via red pixels in the output. It\u2019s like a puzzle where the red pixels are the \u201csnaps\u201d or connection points. The output, then, is the complete image formed by correctly aligning these pieces.\n\n**Hypothesis Development:**\n\nMy initial thought is that the red pixels define how the shapes fit together. If two shapes have compatible red pixel patterns, they should connect at those points. From Example 1, I believe that the puzzle pieces are scattered within the initial grid. The scattered pieces are \"rigid bodies\" and are to be translated and assembled. From Example 1, the red pixels seem to \u201coverlap\u201d in the final image, forming a connecting path.  Also, these shapes are probably assembled such that their bounding boxes are minimized or justified in some way on the final grid. I also see that the shapes form coherent, connected assemblies.\n\n**Algorithm Design:**\n\nMy approach will be:\n\n1.  **Parse and Identify Components:**  First, I will look at each grid, find all distinct shapes and define the red pixels as connection points. The goal is to separate the puzzle pieces based on connectivity (the connected components). I will look at the red pixels to see if any are connected to the shapes. I will treat the cluster of colored pixels + nearby reds as a piece.\n2.  **Connection Analysis:** Then, I need to figure out which pieces connect. I have to look for red pixel patterns. If two pieces have red pixels that have a pattern like `2 0 2`, they might fit together there. The idea is to find a translation (shift) to match the red pixels.\n3.  **Assembly and Placement:** Next, the pieces need to be put together. I need to start with one piece and add others based on those red pixel connections. I need to keep trying pieces until they all overlap correctly. The goal is to try to create one or more rigid bodies, so the code is stable.\n4.  **Finalize:** Finally, I'll place the completed assembly in a new grid (22x22 or 26x26). Center the shape or possibly bottom-align it.\n\n**Example and Test Input Application**\n\nI need to test this out. I have examples which I have checked very carefully. I am going to try the test cases to verify my algorithm.\n\nLet's look at Example 1: I see five pieces with specific colors. These pieces are all connected by the red pixels.  I traced how they connect and confirmed that, at least in Example 1, the red pixels do represent how the pieces should be aligned.\n\nI will also trace the Test Input. First, I need to make sure I am reading the text grid correctly. From the test input and my examples, I can see that the shapes have different structures.\n\nFrom careful tracing:\n*   Shapes need to be read to find their shapes.\n*   Connections via shared red pixels need to be identified.\n\nFrom careful reading, I can see the connectors:\n\n1.  I identify \"P1\" as a Teal shape with red at Top Right.\n2.  I identify \"P2\" as a small Teal shape. With three red pixels on top.\n3.  I identify \"P3\" as Maroon frame at 8,3; 9,4.\n4.  I identify \"P4\" as Yellow box that has the `2 0 2 0 2` interface.\n5.  I identify \"P5\" as Blue shapes.\n6.  I identify \"P6\" as Green box.\n7.  I identify \"P7\" as Orange shape.\n\n**Connector Interface is key, and the red pixels seem to be how to put it all together**\n\nAfter careful tracing and connector identification, I believe I can assemble pieces. The key is in the connectors like the horizontal interface of `2 0 2 0 2`.\n\nAfter checking all the pieces, I tried to connect pieces into groups. I have identified different potential solutions, which I have verified in the text. I am using the connectors to define how pieces overlap.\n*   P2 (Teal) + P4 (Yellow) via connectors 5,7,9.\n*   P3 (Maroon) with P6 (Green).\n*   P5 (Blue) + P7 (Orange).\n*   Then I checked for connectivity.\n*\n\nThe solution involves assembling the scattered object fragments from the input grid into a single coherent structure. The red pixels (value 2) act as \"connectors\" or \"snaps\". By aligning the red pixels of different objects\u2014overlapping them such that the pattern of red pixels matches\u2014we can determine the relative positions of all objects.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Objects and Connectors**\nWe extract the connected components (colors) and their associated red connector pixels.\n1.  **Teal Large (P1):** A large 8-ring top-right. Connectors: Left(3,16), Bot(4,21), Right(1,23).\n2.  **Teal Small (P2):** Small U-shape 8s top-left. Connectors: Top(1,10), (1,12).\n3.  **Maroon (P3):** 9-shape left-middle. Connectors: Bot(8,3), (9,4).\n4.  **Yellow (P4):** 4-block center. Connectors: Top(10,5), (10,7), (10,9), Right(11,14).\n5.  **Blue (P5):** 1-shape right-middle. Connectors: Bot(14,18), (14,23).\n6.  **Green (P6):** 3-shape bottom-left. Connectors: Top(20,4).\n7.  **Orange (P7):** 7-shape bottom-right. Connectors: Top(20,11), (20,16).\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the Puzzle**\nWe find unique alignments where red pixels overlap:\n*   **P5 (Blue) + P1 (Teal Large):** Align P1 Bot(4,21) with P5 Right(14,23). P1 sits on top of P5.\n*   **P4 (Yellow) + P1 (Teal Large):** Align P4 Right(11,14) with P1 Left(3,16) (in its new position relative to P5). P4 attaches to the left of P1.\n*   **P7 (Orange) + P5 (Blue):** Align P7 Top(20,11) with P5 Bot(14,18). P7 hangs below P5.\n*   **P2 (Teal Small) + P4 (Yellow):** Align P2 Top(1,12) with P4 Top(10,7). P2 sits on the left shoulder of P4.\n*   **P3 (Maroon) + P4 (Yellow):** Align P3 Bot(9,4) with P4 Top(10,5). P3 sits on the far-left shoulder of P4.\n*   **P6 (Green) + P3 (Maroon):** Align P6 Top(20,4) with P3 Bot(9,4). P6 hangs below P3.\n\n**Step 3: Construct Output**\nUsing P5 as the anchor, we calculate the final positions of all blocks.\n*   **P5 (Blue):** Base position.\n*   **P1 (Teal Large):** Shifted relative to P5. Frame surrounding P5.\n*   **P4 (Yellow):** Shifted left of P1.\n*   **P7 (Orange):** Shifted below P5.\n*   **P2 (Teal Small):** Shifted on top of P4 (left side).\n*   **P3 (Maroon):** Shifted left of P2/P4 assembly.\n*   **P6 (Green):** Shifted below P3.\n\nFinally, we calculate the bounding box of the assembled shape and center it in the 22x22 output grid. The red connector pixels are removed in the final output.\n\n**Final Coordinates (approximate for placement):**\nThe assembly forms a structure roughly 8 rows high and 19 columns wide.\n*   Top-Left (Maroon/Green stack): Starts Row 7, Col 3.\n*   Middle (Yellow/Teal Small): Starts Row 11, Col 6.\n*   Right (Teal Frame/Blue/Orange): Starts Row 8, Col 13.\n\nOutput Grid Generation:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,0,1,8,8,8,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,3,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,0,1,0,0,8,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,3,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,8,1,0,1,0,0,8,0,0\n0,2,0,0,0,2,8,0,8,4,4,4,4,8,1,1,1,1,1,8,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nNote: The red pixels are \"consumed\" by the connection process and do not appear in the final output (replaced by 0 or the object color if overlapping, but here they seem to just be markers). However, in Example 2, some red pixels remained? No, looking closely at Ex 2 output, there are no red pixels. Wait, looking at Ex 1 output, there are NO red pixels. Wait, Ex 1 output has `3,0,0,0,3` etc. No red (2).\nWait, looking at my generated grid above, I left some 2s in column 2. Those should be 3s or 0s. The Green shape (3) had 3s there. The input had 2s as connectors. The output should have the shape color if it's part of the shape, or 0? The examples suggest the final object is solid/framed in its native color. I will replace the connector positions with the shape's valid pixels or 0. The Green shape's left wall is `3`. The bottom connectors were 2. I'll assume they vanish.\n\nCorrected Logic for 2s: They are removed.\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,3,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,0,0,1,0,8,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,3,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,1,0,0,1,0,8,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,3,8,0,8,4,4,4,4,4,1,0,0,1,0,8,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,8,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation from the examples:\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1. Each example has a central 4\u00d74 block (the anchor)\n2. Other colored shapes have \"2\" markers that indicate connection points\n3. In the output, all shapes are assembled around the 4s block, with shapes connecting where their \"2\" markers align\n4. The \"2\"s act as \"snapping points\" between shapes\n\n**For the test input:**\n- 4s block is at rows 11-14, cols 9-13 (5\u00d75 block)\n- Connection points around 4s: above (10,9), right (11,14), left (14,8), below (15,10)\n\n**Identifying shapes and their connections:**\n- 9s shape: connects above 4s\n- 3s shape: connects to 9s (left side)\n- Large 8s: connects to right of 4s\n- Small 8s: connects to large 8s\n- 1s: connects to large 8s\n- 7s: connects below 4s\n\n**Output Assembly:**\nAfter repositioning shapes so their 2-markers align:\n- 9s moves to rows 7-10, cols 8-12\n- 3s moves to rows 8-11, cols 3-8\n- Large 8s moves to rows 9-12, cols 14-20\n- Small 8s moves to rows 9-11, cols 21-23\n- 1s moves to rows 12-17, cols 18-23\n- 7s moves to row 16, cols 10-15\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,2,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,9,9,9,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,8,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "The grids contain several separate \u201cpieces\u201d made of a main color, plus some **2** cells that act like **connectors**.  \nIn the outputs, these pieces are **not recolored or rotated**; instead they are **translated** so that connector cells (**2**) from different pieces **overlap exactly**, assembling one connected construction. The only piece that stays fixed is the solid **4** rectangle (it is the anchor).\n\nHow to reconstruct:\n\n1. **Find each connected component** of non\u2011zero cells (treat color 2 as part of the piece).\n2. Identify the component containing the solid **4** block; **leave it in place**.\n3. For every other piece, **translate it** so that its connector cells (**2**) coincide with matching connector cells of already placed pieces:\n   - connector pairs with the same spacing must overlap (this fixes the translation),\n   - connectors must face each other (top with bottom, left with right).\n4. After all pieces are attached, everything else is background **0**.\n\nApplied to the test:\n- The large 8-piece locks onto the fixed 4-block (two connectors align at once).\n- The 9-piece locks onto the large 8-piece (again two connectors align).\n- The small 8-piece attaches under the 9-piece via its two top connectors.\n- On the other side, the 3-piece locks onto the 4-block (two connectors align), then the 1-piece attaches under it via a matching connector pair, and the 7-strip attaches under the 1-piece.\n\nFinal output grid (26\u00d726):\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n- Color **4** forms a solid rectangular block. In both solved examples this block **stays fixed in place** and acts as the \u201cbase\u201d.\n- Other colored shapes are separate connected components. They include some **color 2 pixels attached to them**.\n- Those **2-pixels are connection pins**. The task is to **translate (move) whole components without rotating** so that:\n  - **matching pin patterns overlap** (a single 2 matches a single 2; a pair of 2s with the same spacing matches another such pair),\n  - producing one assembled connected structure,\n  - and everything else becomes background 0.\n\nSo the transformation is:  \n**Keep the 4-block where it is, then slide all other components until their 2-pins \u201cplug into\u201d matching 2-pins, building the unique connected assembly.**\n\n---\n\n### Applying it to the test\n\n1. **Anchor**: the big **4** rectangle (rows 12\u201315, cols 10\u201314) is kept fixed. Its attached 2-pins are the fixed docking points.\n\n2. Find components whose **relative 2-pin layout matches** pairs of docking points:\n   - The **green (3)** component has two single pins positioned so that, when its **right pin** is placed onto the anchor\u2019s **left pin**, its **top pin** simultaneously lands on the anchor\u2019s **bottom pin**. So we translate the whole green piece there.\n   - The **large blue (8)** component similarly has two single pins whose offset matches the anchor\u2019s **top** and **right** pins, so it is translated to plug into both at once.\n\n3. Attach remaining components by matching **pair pins** (same spacing):\n   - Green\u2019s bottom pair (spacing 3) matches the **white (1)** top pair (spacing 3) \u2192 attach white under green.\n   - White\u2019s bottom pair (spacing 5) matches the **orange (7)** top pair (spacing 5) \u2192 attach the 7-bar under white.\n   - The **magenta (9)** piece has single pins positioned to match the remaining pins on the large blue piece \u2192 attach it there.\n   - The **small blue (8)** piece\u2019s top pair (spacing 2) matches the magenta\u2019s bottom pair (spacing 2) \u2192 attach it below the 9 piece.\n\nThis yields the final assembled structure (all other cells are 0).\n\n---\n\n## Output grid (26\u00d726)\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,2,8,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",
