        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment: Understanding the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to tackle an ARC task involving two example grids and a test grid. The task seems to be about identifying patterns and transformations, specifically how shapes move within these grids. I need to figure out the rules for these shape movements, given two examples. I'll need to carefully analyze the input grids, identify the shapes (which are connected components of non-background color), track their movements between the input and output grids, and then predict the behavior for the test input.\n\n**Analyzing Example 1: Decoding the Movements**\n\nThe first example has a grid size of 28x19, with the background color as 0. I need to identify the shapes, their colors, and their positions in the input grid. I see a yellow hook, a red \"blob\" (more pixels on the bottom), a blue inverted-T, and a green cross. Then, I observe how the shapes are arranged in the output grid. Some shapes (the blue and green ones) move to the top edge, while the yellow and red shapes shift to the bottom edge.\n\nTo understand this movement, I have to find a rule that explains which shapes go where. Is it color-based? No. In this example, the blue/green shapes moved up, the yellow/red went down. Is there a consistent color-to-movement pattern across *both* examples? I need to analyze Example 2.\n\n**Analyzing Example 2: Searching for Consistency**\n\nExample 2 has a 30x30 grid. The background color is 5. I've identified several shapes: a green square with a tail, a blue L-shape, an orange small L or triangle, a maroon small L or triangle, a red ring, and a yellow inverted T-shape. In the output, it's a completely different situation.\n\nRed, Orange, Maroon, and Green shapes move to the top of the output grid. Yellow and blue ones shift to the bottom. I need to find the rule that ties the shapes to their movement. The movement isn't tied directly to color, because blue went up in one example but down in the other. I need to identify something intrinsic to each shape that controls its movement.\n\n**Feature Engineering: Pixel Count, Bounding Box, and Symmetry**\n\nI'm checking pixel counts. For Example 1, I find the following:\n*   Blue (T) has 7 pixels.\n*   Green (Cross) has 7 pixels.\n*   Yellow (Hook) has 5 pixels.\n*   Red (Blob) has 11 pixels.\n\nAt first, I hypothesize \"Symmetry\" as the deciding factor, since the blue and green shapes look symmetric and the others are not. So, symmetric -> UP, Asymmetric -> DOWN. But Example 2's shapes show that symmetric doesn't guarantee UP movement and asymmetric doesn't guarantee DOWN movement.\n\nExample 2 has:\n*   Red (Ring): 8 pixels. Moves UP.\n*   Yellow (Inverted T): 5 pixels. Moves DOWN.\n*   Green (H-like shape with tail): Has a hole and moves UP.\n*   Other shapes seem to be non-symmetric, but this doesn't consistently align with their movement.\n\nSo Symmetry seems broken as a core feature.\n\n**Focusing on Shape Orientation and Pixel Counts**\n\nI decide to check if shapes oriented with \"heavy top\" parts always move up. This seems to hold for Example 1, but Example 2's Yellow shape has a heavy bottom and *still* went down.\n\nAfter examining it further, I realize that it may involve pixel count and size. If I focus on pixel counts, I find:\n\n*   Example 1: 7 pixels = UP, 5 & 11 pixels = DOWN.\n*   Example 2: shapes with 3, 8 and 9 pixels move up, while ones with 4, 5 moved down.\n\nSo, in the examples I see some shapes moving up when smaller in size (3, 7, 8, 9) and some going down with larger pixel counts (4, 5, 11).\n\n**Formulating the Rule: Pixel Count Thresholds**\n\nI try to connect pixel count to the movement:\n*  \"If the count is < 6, move DOWN; Otherwise move UP.\"\n*   \"Are the number counts odd or even?\": That doesn't work.\n\nAfter more testing, I realize that pixel count modulates a movement function, but isn't as simple as `N` is even or odd, or `N` is prime or composite.\n\n**Discovering the Consistent Pixel Count Rule**\n\nI recognize that the key is a consistent threshold.\nThe pattern has an intersection:\n{\n\nThe problem requires identifying shapes in the grid and moving them either to the top edge or the bottom edge, preserving their horizontal positions (columns). The background color is determined by the most frequent color, which is 9 (maroon) in the test input.\n\n**Logic derived from examples:**\nThe decision to move a shape UP or DOWN appears to be based on the number of pixels ($N$) making up the shape.\n- From Example 1 and Example 2, we observed:\n    - $N = 3, 7, 8, 9 \\rightarrow$ Move **UP**.\n    - $N = 4, 5, 11 \\rightarrow$ Move **DOWN**.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Teal L-shape (Color 8):**\n    -   Located at columns 1-2.\n    -   Pixels: (15,2), (16,1), (16,2). Total $N=3$.\n    -   Action: Move **UP** to rows 0-1.\n2.  **Blue Cross (Color 1):**\n    -   Located at columns 4-7.\n    -   Pixels: (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,6), (8,6). Total $N=7$.\n    -   Action: Move **UP** to rows 0-3.\n3.  **Orange L-shape (Color 7):**\n    -   Located at columns 11-12.\n    -   Pixels: (7,11), (7,12), (8,11). Total $N=3$.\n    -   Action: Move **UP** to rows 0-1.\n4.  **Yellow T-shape (Color 4):**\n    -   Located at columns 15-17.\n    -   Pixels: (4,15), (4,16), (4,17), (5,16), (6,16). Total $N=5$.\n    -   Action: Move **DOWN** to rows 16-18.\n5.  **Pink Cross (Color 6):**\n    -   Located at columns 21-24.\n    -   Pixels: (11,22), (12,22), (13,21), (13,22), (13,23), (13,24), (14,22). Total $N=7$.\n    -   Action: Move **UP** to rows 0-3.\n6.  **Green Diamond (Color 3):**\n    -   Located at columns 22-24.\n    -   Pixels: (2,23), (3,22), (3,24), (4,23). Total $N=4$.\n    -   Action: Move **DOWN** to rows 16-18.\n\n**Constructing Output Grid:**\n-   **Row 0:** Teal (part), Blue (part), Orange (part), Pink (part).\n-   **Row 1:** Teal (part), Blue (part), Orange (part), Pink (part).\n-   **Row 2:** Blue (part), Pink (part).\n-   **Row 3:** Blue (part), Pink (part).\n-   **Rows 4-15:** Empty (Background 9).\n-   **Row 16:** Yellow (part), Green (part).\n-   **Row 17:** Yellow (part), Green (part).\n-   **Row 18:** Yellow (part), Green (part).\n\n9,9,8,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Test Input Solution for ARC Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I've been tasked with an ARC problem. After analyzing two example grids and a test grid, I've noticed a pattern. It looks like the core task involves rearranging objects within the grid. My gut says it's not a simple reflection or rotation. Example 1 shows the shapes are not flipped, but moved.  The colors are: blue(1), green(3), yellow(4), red(2).\n\nThe key seems to be where the shapes \"start\" on the grid (initial Y-coordinate). If a shape is \"high\" or above the midline, it goes bottom in the output. If a shape starts low in the input, it shifts top in the output. The shapes aren't \"flipped\" but their placement changes relative to each other. Example 2 clarifies that this isn't simply a vertical flip of all pixels.\n\nThe problem seems to be an edge case. Shapes can overlap, so it's not simply pushing to edges. There is the background color, it's 0 in the first example, and 5 in the second example, and 9 for the Test.\nIs there a shape-property, like holes, or convex, to explain the mapping? Let's check. Not just solid objects or a specific topology.\n\nI finally nailed down a rule, it follows the mapping that shapes can not overlap each other.\n*Test Grid*:\nColors present: blue(1), green(3), yellow(4), pink(6), orange(7), teal(8).\n\nThe mapping rule: \"Tree-like shapes\" goes to bottom edge, and \"Compact shapes\" to the top edge.  The shapes are 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 3.\nThe shapes at the Top have to be the: Green(3), Orange(7), Teal(8) shape, or Compact shapes.\nThe shapes at the Bottom have to be the: Blue(1), Yellow(4), Pink(6), or Tree shapes.\n\nShapes are assigned top or bottom. The shapes in the grid are preserved in the assigned edges.\n\nFinal output: Place Top objects flush with Row 0. Place Bottom objects flush with Row 18, and draw the objects according to the input examples.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rule is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Identify all connected components (objects) formed by non-background pixels. The background color is determined by the majority color (0 in Example 1, 5 in Example 2, 9 in the Test Input).\n2.  **Preserve Shape and Horizontal Position:** Each object maintains its original shape (pixels and orientation) and its horizontal (X-axis) position.\n3.  **Vertical Displacement to Edges:** Each object is moved vertically to either the very top (flush with Row 0) or the very bottom (flush with the last row) of the grid.\n4.  **Sorting Rule (Top vs Bottom):**\n    *   The rule for determining whether an object goes to the Top or Bottom depends on the geometric properties of the shape, derived consistently from Example 2 (which shares a non-zero background with the test case).\n    *   **Compact / Ring / Block / Small L-shapes** go to the **Top**.\n        *   In Example 2: Green (Ring), Red (Ring), Center 7/9 (Block/Small L) moved to Top.\n    *   **Linear / Tree-like / Cross / T-shapes** go to the **Bottom**.\n        *   In Example 2: Blue (T-shape), Yellow (T-shape) moved to Bottom.\n    *   *Note: Example 1 (Background 0) followed a different parity-based logic, but the geometric classification fits the more complex Example 2 and the Test Input better.*\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Background:** 9.\n*   **Objects and Classification:**\n    *   **Teal (8)** at Cols 1-2: Small L-shape. -> **Top**.\n    *   **Orange (7)** at Cols 11-12: Small L-shape. -> **Top**.\n    *   **Green (3)** at Cols 22-24: Diamond with hole (Ring-like). -> **Top**.\n    *   **Blue (1)** at Cols 4-7: Cross/Tree shape (inverted 7 with base). -> **Bottom**.\n    *   **Yellow (4)** at Cols 15-17: T-shape. -> **Bottom**.\n    *   **Pink (6)** at Cols 21-24: Cross shape. -> **Bottom**.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   **Top Group (Teal, Orange, Green):** X ranges are [1-2], [11-12], [22-24]. No overlap.\n*   **Bottom Group (Blue, Yellow, Pink):** X ranges are [4-7], [15-17], [21-24]. No overlap.\n\n**Final Construction:**\n*   **Teal (8):** Moves to Rows 0-1.\n*   **Orange (7):** Moves to Rows 0-1.\n*   **Green (3):** Moves to Rows 0-2.\n*   **Blue (1):** Moves to Rows 15-18 (Height 4).\n*   **Yellow (4):** Moves to Rows 16-18 (Height 3).\n*   **Pink (6):** Moves to Rows 15-18 (Height 4).\n\n9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9",

The rule appears to be:\n- Shapes in **top-left quadrant** \u2192 move to **bottom** of output\n- Shapes in **bottom-right quadrant** \u2192 move to **bottom** of output  \n- Shapes in **top-right quadrant** \u2192 move to **top** of output\n- Shapes in **bottom-left quadrant** \u2192 move to **top** of output\n- Shapes near the **center** \u2192 move to **top** of output\n\nColumn positions are preserved, and shapes align to the very top (row 0) or very bottom (last row) of the output.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nGrid is 19 rows \u00d7 28 columns. Center at row 9.5, col 14.\n\nIdentifying shapes and their quadrants:\n- **Shape 1** (rows 5-8, cols 4-7): top-left \u2192 **bottom**\n- **Shape 3** (rows 2-4, cols 22-24): top-right \u2192 **top**\n- **Shape 4** (rows 4-6, cols 15-17): top-right \u2192 **top**\n- **Shape 6** (rows 11-14, cols 21-24): bottom-right \u2192 **bottom**\n- **Shape 7** (rows 7-8, cols 11-12): near center \u2192 **top**\n- **Shape 8** (rows 15-16, cols 1-2): bottom-left \u2192 **top**\n\n**Building Output:**\n- Top shapes (3, 4, 7, 8) start at row 0\n- Bottom shapes (1, 6) end at row 18\n\n```\n9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n```",

These occupied columns form contiguous blocks separated by fully-background columns.  \n   Let **`x_div`** be the **first column of the second occupied block from the left**.\n\n4. **Decide whether each object goes to the top edge or bottom edge**  \n   For each object, compute its bounding box top-left corner `(y_min, x_min)`:\n   - It is **left** if `x_min < x_div`, otherwise **right**.\n   - It is **above** if `y_min < y_div`, otherwise **in the bottom band**.\n\n   Placement rule (matches both examples):\n   - **Top edge** if (right & above) **or** (left & bottom-band).\n   - **Bottom edge** if (left & above) **or** (right & bottom-band).\n\n5. **Move objects vertically only**\n   - If assigned to **top**, shift it so its `y_min` becomes 1.\n   - If assigned to **bottom**, shift it so its `y_max` becomes the last row.\n   - Keep all columns unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n- Background = **9**.\n- Occupied row blocks: rows **3\u20139** and **12\u201317** \u21d2 bottommost block starts at **row 12**, so `y_div = 12`.\n- Occupied column blocks: **2\u20133**, **5\u20138**, **12\u201313**, **16\u201318**, **22\u201325** \u21d2 second block starts at **column 5**, so `x_div = 5`.\n\nClassifying objects:\n- **Color 6** object has `y_min = 12` (bottom band) and `x_min = 22` (right) \u21d2 **goes to bottom**.\n- **Color 8** object has `y_min = 16` (bottom band) and `x_min = 2` (left) \u21d2 **goes to top**.\n- All other objects (1,3,4,7) are right & above \u21d2 **go to top**.\n\nAfter shifting accordingly, the output grid is:\n\n9,9,8,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9",

All non-background cells form several colored \u201cobjects\u201d (in example 1, even disconnected parts of the same color move together, so treat **all cells of a color** as one object).  \n3. Inside the bounding box that contains *all* non-background cells, there is:\n   - a **horizontal empty band** (one or more consecutive rows of pure background) that acts as a separator between \u201cupper\u201d and \u201clower\u201d objects,\n   - and a **vertical empty band** (one or more consecutive columns of pure background) that acts as a separator between \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d objects.  \n   From the examples:  \n   - the **horizontal band** chosen is the **largest** internal all-background row band,  \n   - the **vertical band** chosen is the **rightmost** internal all-background column band.\n4. These two bands split the objects into 4 quadrants (Top/Bottom \u00d7 Left/Right).  \n5. **Quadrant rule (matches both examples):**\n   - Objects in **Top-Right** and **Bottom-Left** move to the **top edge** (their topmost row becomes row 0).\n   - Objects in **Top-Left** and **Bottom-Right** move to the **bottom edge** (their bottommost row becomes the last row).\n   \nEquivalently:  \nLet `left = object is left of the vertical empty band` and `above = object is above the horizontal empty band`.  \nThen the object goes to the **top** iff `left XOR above` is true; otherwise it goes to the **bottom**.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input  \n- Background color is **9**.  \n- The largest internal empty horizontal band is **rows 9\u201310** (all 9s).  \n- The rightmost internal empty vertical band is **columns 18\u201320** (all 9s).  \n\nQuadrants:\n- **Top-Right**: color **3** \u2192 move to **top**\n- **Bottom-Left**: color **8** \u2192 move to **top**\n- **Top-Left**: colors **1, 4, 7** \u2192 move to **bottom**\n- **Bottom-Right**: color **6** \u2192 move to **bottom**\n\nThen shift each color\u2019s cells straight up or down (columns unchanged) so its bounding box touches the target edge.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9",
