The output shows the unique pattern that appears in only one section (or a \"cleaned\" version showing distinctive elements).\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nThe test input is a 15\u00d715 grid with background color 6 and pattern color 8. There's no explicit vertical divider line, but the grid can be conceptually divided into a 3\u00d73 arrangement of 5\u00d75 sections.\n\nLooking at the 8s distribution:\n- There's a distinctive **cross/plus pattern** centered around rows 5-7, columns 5-9\n- This pattern in the center section (rows 5-9, cols 5-9) forms:\n  - Row 5: 8 at position 2 (col 7)\n  - Row 6: 8s at positions 1,2,3 (cols 6,7,8)\n  - Row 7: 8s at positions 1,3 (cols 6,8)\n\nThis cross pattern is unique - it doesn't appear duplicated elsewhere. The other 8s in the grid are scattered single points or small groups.\n\nExtracting the center 5\u00d75 section (which contains this unique cross pattern):\n\n```\n6,6,8,6,6\n6,8,8,8,6\n6,8,6,8,6\n6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6\n```\n\nThis follows the pattern from the examples where the output shows the distinctive/unique pattern from the sectioned input.\n\n**Output:**\n```\n6,6,8,6,6\n6,8,8,8,6\n6,8,6,8,6\n6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_3\">\nLooking at the solved examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.

The transformation appears to find elements that are either:\n   - Common to all sections (appearing in the same position across all)\n   - Unique patterns that appear in only one section (normalized/shifted)\n\n**For the test input:**\nThe 15\u00d715 grid doesn't have explicit separator columns. Looking at the structure, I can divide it into a 3\u00d73 arrangement of 5\u00d75 sections.\n\nExtracting the sections, I notice:\n- The center section (rows 5-9, cols 5-9) contains a distinctive cross/T-shaped pattern of 8s\n- Other sections have scattered single 8s\n\nThe center section (1,1) pattern:\n```\nRow 5: ..8..

The initial approach was a detailed analysis of the given grids, looking for separators, color patterns, and attempting to deduce an operation (AND, OR, XOR) to generate the output from the input sections.\n\nI quickly realized the examples likely involve *object extraction*. Specifically, the task is to identify shapes or objects that are present in the input and then \"denoise\" or \"filter\" out all the other patterns. I needed to extract the correct object.  For Ex 1, the Caret shape was most prominent, even though it was within other dots.\n\nI moved on to Ex 2, and again, the task seemed to center around *shape recognition and preservation*. A key observation was the symmetry of preferred shapes. If a symmetric shape exists, it is more likely to be the one extracted and shown in the output. I also realized that the location of the object in the output may relate to the position of similar objects in the input.\n\nEx 3 proved insightful, revealing connections within the extracted objects. I suspected some overlaying or combining of sections.  The output shape, a 'Y', prompted a closer look at object formation and connections.\n\nThe Test Input, unlike the examples, had no clear separators and lacked distinct sections. The object here was the most coherent shape. The \"Space Invader\" shape popped out. From the examples I knew I had to locate it and then remove noise.\n\nI reevaluated my understanding of the problem.  The key takeaway from the examples was that the task is *denoising, pattern extraction, and in particular, symmetric shape extraction*.  \n\nMy final plan was to identify the dominant shape (the Space Invader), isolate its pixels (using the image), and create a 15x15 output grid that has that shape, and then populate the rest with the background color. Position is kept. Symmetry is central.\n\n\nThe goal of this task is to identify a specific \"object\" or pattern hidden within a noisy grid and isolate it, removing all other \"noise\" pixels.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** The input grid is divided into three vertical sections. Each section contains scattered yellow pixels (4) on a blue background (1).\n    *   **Observation:** Section 1 contains a distinct caret `^` shape formed by three pixels: `(1,1)`, `(2,3)`, `(2,5)` (relative to section start? No, coordinates relative to the shape's bounding box are `(0,1)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,2)`). The output grid isolates this `^` shape, preserving its relative position from the first section. Other scattered pixels are removed.\n2.  **Example 2:** The input has four sections.\n    *   **Observation:** Several shapes are present. Section 4 contains an upright `T` shape. Section 1 contains an inverted `T`. Sections 2 and 3 contain `L` shapes. The output grid shows only the upright `T` shape. The position in the output `(row 5)` matches the row of the object in Section 1, while the shape matches Section 4. This suggests finding a \"significant\" shape (perhaps the most symmetric or \"upright\" one) and placing it.\n3.  **Example 3:** The input has two sections.\n    *   **Observation:** The output is a `Y` shape. This shape is symmetric. The task involves filtering out the random noise pixels and keeping the coherent, symmetric object.\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\n1.  **Identify the Object:** Scan the grid for connected components of the pattern color. In the examples, the \"correct\" object is a coherent, symmetric shape (like `^`, `T`, `Y`). Random isolated pixels or non-symmetric clusters are treated as noise.\n2.  **Remove Noise:** Clear all pixels that are not part of the identified object, setting them to the background color.\n3.  **Preserve Position:** In the absence of multiple sections conflicting on position (as seen in Example 2), the object remains in its original coordinates.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Properties:** 15x15 grid. Background color is Magenta (6). Pattern color is Teal (8). There are no vertical separators.\n*   **Object Search:** We look for connected components of color 8.\n    *   Rows 1, 3, 8, 13 contain isolated or sparsely paired pixels (noise).\n    *   Rows 5, 6, 7 contain a cluster centered around `(6,7)`.\n        *   Row 5: Pixel at `(5,7)`.\n        *   Row 6: Pixels at `(6,6), (6,7), (6,8)`. (Note: pixels at `4` and `10` are not connected to this central mass).\n        *   Row 7: Pixels at `(7,6), (7,8)`.\n*   **Shape Identification:** The connected pixels form a symmetric figure resembling a \"space invader\" or stick figure:\n    ```\n      8\n     888\n     8 8\n    ```\n    This is the only significant symmetric connected object in the grid.\n*   **Construction:** We create a 15x15 grid filled with the background color (6). We then place the pixels of the identified object at their original coordinates.\n    *   `(5,7)` -> 8\n    *   `(6,6), (6,7), (6,8)` -> 8\n    *   `(7,6), (7,8)` -> 8\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n*   Rows 0-4: All 6.\n*   Row 5: `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6`\n*   Row 6: `6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6`\n*   Row 7: `6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6`\n*   Rows 8-14: All 6.\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n<REASONING_MODEL_C model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_5_step_5_generate_hint\">\nLooking at this problem, I need to understand the pattern from the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Input has 26 columns with dividers (color 3) at columns 8 and 17, creating 3 panels of 8 columns each.

The other 8s are isolated noise.\n\nFollowing the pattern: output the grid with only the main connected shape preserved.\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_C>\n</CANDIDATE 4>\n<CANDIDATE 8>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 15x15\n666666666666666\n666666686666666\n666666888666666\n666666868666666\n666666666666666\n666666666666666\n666666666666666\n666666666666666\n666666666666666\n666666666666666\n666666666666666\n666666666666666\n666666666666666\n666666666666666\n666666666666666\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_3_step_3\">\n### Key observations from the solved examples\n\n1. **Inputs are made of one or more equal \u201cpanels\u201d separated by full-height vertical separator columns** (a single color forming a solid vertical line).  \n   - Example 1: two separator columns \u2192 3 panels.\n   - Example 2: three separator columns \u2192 4 panels.\n   - Example 3: one separator column \u2192 2 panels.\n   - The **output width equals the width of one panel** (separators removed).\n\n2. Inside the panels there are:\n   - A dominant **background color**.\n   - One **foreground color** (the \u201cink\u201d pixels).\n   - A special **anchor pixel**: a foreground pixel that appears in *every* panel at the *same relative coordinate* and is **isolated** (no neighboring foreground pixels in its 8-neighborhood).  \n     If several qualify, pick the **topmost, then leftmost**.\n\n3. Each panel also contains one main **foreground component** (8-connected).  \n   We select the component (over all panels) whose **closest pixel is nearest to the anchor** (Manhattan distance). (If only one panel, this just means \u201cpick the largest component excluding the anchor\u201d.)\n\n4. That selected component has a clear **\u201ctip side\u201d**: in its bounding box, one edge has *fewer* foreground pixels than the opposite edge (often 1 vs 2 or 3). That edge indicates whether the component is pointing **up/down/left/right**.\n\n5. The component is **rotated** so that:\n   - If the anchor is closer to the **top** than the bottom, the component\u2019s tip should point **up** (so the bulk lies below the anchor).\n   - If the anchor is closer to the **bottom**, the tip should point **down**.\n\n6. After rotation, the component is **translated** so that its **tip pixel** lands exactly on the anchor coordinate.  \n   The output grid is otherwise empty background (only this placed component remains).\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n- There are **no full-height separator columns**, so this is effectively **one panel** (output is also 15\u00d715).\n- Background color is **6**; foreground color is **8**.\n- The **anchor** (topmost-leftmost isolated 8) is at **(row 2, col 8)**.\n- The largest 8-connected component of 8\u2019s is the cluster around rows 6\u20138, cols 7\u20139 (6 pixels).  \n  Its bounding box shows the **tip is the single pixel on the top edge** (so it already points **up**), matching the \u201canchor near top \u21d2 tip up\u201d rule.\n- Translate this component so its tip (originally at (6,8)) moves to the anchor (2,8): shift **up by 4 rows**.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gemini-3-high_7_step_5_image\">\n**The Puzzle of the Panels**\n\nMy mission, should I choose to accept it (and I have), is to decipher these ARC puzzles. The gist seems to be that we're given a set of grids\u2014the inputs\u2014often divided into vertical sections. There's a \"test\" input, too. The outputs are smaller grids that somehow represent a distillation or recombination of these input sections.\n\nMy initial thought is that the solution involves identifying and manipulating \"signals\" within the grids and that separator lines help define sections. The outputs appear to be made of particular shapes, so I'll try to find those shapes in the inputs.\n\nLet's dive into the examples. Example 1 has vertical separators, which divide a large input grid into panels. I begin by analyzing this example, focusing on the distinct patterns within these panels, particularly where the color \"4\" appears. The problem is complicated by noise, which makes it hard to quickly see a pattern.\n\nA \"common\" idea appears in the outputs, and I wonder if the goal is to determine the shape that the input panels *share*. I then consider shapes that the input panels have that the outputs do *not*. A variety of logical combinations, like XOR and looking at pixels present in exactly one input panel, seemed promising but, I concluded, led nowhere.\n\nSo I look closer, and notice that the output is some transformed version of the input, and try a theory that the \"correct\" panel is the one with the vertically symmetric component. I note the output shape and seek for the same in the input panels, and, after much consideration, settle on finding the unique shape in the input grids and extracting it. I also consider transformations such as flipping and positioning of an isolated shape.\n\nThe test input has no panels, just a single grid. The same principles should apply, so I look at this particular pattern and its relationship to the example and consider what the \"object\" might be. I also consider what this object's relationship to the overall shape of the board, and which edge of the board the object is likely to align.\n\nThe objective seems clear: I must find the symmetric shapes! The object is the connected component I seek, and I must flip the object if it is an inverted shape and align it to a new location. With this logic, I believe I can decode all the puzzles!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on patterns found in the solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Identify the Object:** In each example, there is a \"signal\" panel containing a vertically symmetric connected component (the object), while other panels contain noise or partial shapes.\n    *   Example 1 (Yellow `4`): Panel 2 contains a symmetric `V` shape. The output contains an upright `^` shape. (Flipped).\n    *   Example 2 (Green `3`): Panel 2 contains a symmetric Inverted `T` shape. Panel 4 contains a symmetric Upright `T`. The output contains an Upright `T`. (If derived from P2, it's flipped).\n    *   Example 3 (Pink `6`): Panel 2 contains a symmetric `Arrow` shape. The output contains the same `Arrow` shape. (Not flipped).\n    *   **Rule for Object:** Find the symmetric shape. Ensure it is \"upright\" (e.g., pointed top, or head at top). The `V` and Inverted `T` are considered \"inverted\" and are flipped. The `Arrow` and Upright `T` are kept as is.\n\n2.  **Identify the Position:** The final position of the object in the output grid seems to be determined by \"guide\" or \"noise\" pixels present in the first panel (or the grid itself).\n    *   Example 1: There is a noise pixel at `(1, 1)` in Panel 1. The output object's top-center is placed at `(1, 1)`.\n    *   Example 3: There is a noise pixel at `(0, 5)` in Panel 1. The output object's top-center is placed at `(0, 5)`.\n    *   Example 2: The output object is at Row 5. There is a noise pixel at `(5, 4)` in Panel 1. The object is centered horizontally at 4, so its top aligns with `(5, 4)`. (Green objects might align to the lowest guide pixel, or follow a falling gravity rule, but Cyan is likely to follow the Yellow/Pink \"floating\" behavior).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Grid Analysis:** The input is a single 15x15 grid (no separators). Background is Pink (6), Foreground is Cyan (8).\n2.  **Object Extraction:** There is a symmetric shape formed by Cyan (8) pixels in the lower half (Rows 5-7), centered at Column 7.\n    *   Shape structure:\n        *   Row 5: Pixel at col 7.\n        *   Row 6: Pixels at cols 6, 7, 8.\n        *   Row 7: Pixels at cols 6, 8.\n    *   This forms a \"Space Invader\" or \"Bug\" shape:\n        ```\n          8\n         888\n         8 8\n        ```\n    *   This shape is already \"upright\" (head at top, legs at bottom), similar to the `Arrow` in Example 3. So, **no flip** is needed.\n\n3.  **Positioning:** We look for the \"guide\" pixel in the noise.\n    *   The noise pixels are scattered around the grid (e.g., at (1,7), (1,11), (3,3), etc.).\n    *   Based on the \"floating\" behavior of non-green objects (Ex 1 & 3), we look for the **topmost** guide pixel.\n    *   The topmost noise pixel is at **Row 1, Column 7**.\n    *   Therefore, we place the top-center of our object at **(1, 7)**.\n\n4.  **Construction:**\n    *   Create a 15x15 grid filled with background (6).\n    *   Draw the object such that its top pixel is at `(1, 7)`.\n    *   Coordinates of object relative to top-center `(r, c)`:\n        *   Top: `(r, c)`\n        *   Middle: `(r+1, c-1), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+1)`\n        *   Bottom: `(r+2, c-1), (r+2, c+1)`\n    *   Target `(r, c) = (1, 7)`.\n    *   Pixels to set to 8:\n        *   `(1, 7)`\n        *   `(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)`\n        *   `(3, 6), (3, 8)`\n\n**Output Grid:**\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n...

So **no rotation** is needed.\n- Translate the main component so its top tip lands on (1,7), i.e. shift it **up by 4 rows**.\n\n### Output grid\n```csv\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_D>\n<REASONING_MODEL_E model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_12_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the examples)\n\n1. **Find divider columns** (a full-height vertical line of a non-background color).  \n   - If present, the grid is split into equal-width panels and the output width is one panel width.  \n   - **In the test input there are no such full-height divider columns**, so there is only **one panel** and the output keeps the **same 15\u00d715 size**.\n\n2. **Identify background vs foreground.**  \n   - Background is the most frequent color \u2192 **6**.  \n   - Foreground pixels are the other color present \u2192 **8**.\n\n3. **Find the \u201cmain sprite\u201d as the largest 8-connected foreground cluster** (diagonals count as connected, matching the examples\u2019 diagonal link behavior).  \n   - In the test input, there is one 8-connected cluster of size **6** (around rows 6\u20138, cols 7\u20139).  \n   - All other 8s are isolated single-pixel noise.\n\n4. **Find the anchor (\u201cmarker\u201d)**: the **topmost-leftmost isolated** foreground pixel (in multi-panel examples it\u2019s the isolated pixel that repeats across panels; with one panel we use the same selection rule on the single panel).  \n   - The topmost isolated 8 is at **(row 2, col 8)**.\n\n5. **Normalize orientation and translate the main sprite to the anchor.**  \n   - The main sprite\u2019s bounding box has a **single-pixel row** at its top (the pixel at (6,8)), so it is already in the \u201ctip-at-top\u201d orientation.  \n   - Translate so that this tip pixel moves to the anchor at (2,8): shift **up by 4 rows**, same column.\n\n6. **Output**: a background-filled grid with **only** the translated main cluster; all other 8s are removed (set to background 6).\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_E>\n</CANDIDATE 8>\n</INPUT_DATA>\n\n<AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\nExecute this pipeline sequentially for every Candidate.

Else, preserve color.\"\n- *Constraint:* If the reasoning is incoherent or vague, mark the Candidate as \"INVALID - VAGUE\".\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT (CRITICAL)\n- You must \"Back-Test\" the Crystallized Rule against the {{SOLVED_EXAMPLES}}.\n- For **EACH** Solved Example pair (Input -> Output), you must strictly perform this 3-step check:\n  1. **Hypothesis:** \"If I apply the Candidate's Rule to this Input, exactly what *should* happen?\"\n  2. **Observation:** \"Look at the actual Official Output. What *actually* happened?\"\n  3. **Verdict:** \"Do they match?\"\n- **Fatal Contradictions to Watch For:**\n  * **Scope Error:** Rule applies to specific colors (e.g., \"Blue\"), but the example changes \"Red\" pixels.\n  * **Geometry Error:** Rule says \"rotate 90,\" but example shows a flip.\n  * **Object Error:** Rule treats pixels individually, but example shows objects moving as blocks.\n- *Constraint:* Record exactly how many Solved Examples the candidate PASSED vs FAILED. **Do not stop at the first failure**; check all examples to determine the severity of the failure (e.g., \"Passed 2/3 Examples\").\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n- For Candidates that survived Phase 2 (or passed at least one example):\n- Look at the {{TEST_INPUT}} and the Candidate's <PROPOSED_SOLUTION> grid.\n- Does the proposed output actually follow the Crystallized Rule?\n- *Common Hallucination:* The text says \"Move Blue,\" but the grid shows Blue staying still.

The output shows the unique pattern that appears in only one section (or a \"cleaned\" version showing distinctive elements).\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nThe test input is a 15\u00d715 grid with background color 6 and pattern color 8. There's no explicit vertical divider line, but the grid can be conceptually divided into a 3\u00d73 arrangement of 5\u00d75 sections.\n\nLooking at the 8s distribution:\n- There's a distinctive **cross/plus pattern** centered around rows 5-7, columns 5-9\n- This pattern in the center section (rows 5-9, cols 5-9) forms:\n  - Row 5: 8 at position 2 (col 7)\n  - Row 6: 8s at positions 1,2,3 (cols 6,7,8)\n  - Row 7: 8s at positions 1,3 (cols 6,8)\n\nThis cross pattern is unique - it doesn't appear duplicated elsewhere. The other 8s in the grid are scattered single points or small groups.\n\nExtracting the center 5\u00d75 section (which contains this unique cross pattern):\n\n```\n6,6,8,6,6\n6,8,8,8,6\n6,8,6,8,6\n6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6\n```\n\nThis follows the pattern from the examples where the output shows the distinctive/unique pattern from the sectioned input.\n\n**Output:**\n```\n6,6,8,6,6\n6,8,8,8,6\n6,8,6,8,6\n6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,8,6,6\n      6,8,8,8,6\n      6,8,6,8,6\n      6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the solved examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1. Each input grid is divided into sections by separator columns (color 3 in Ex1, color 2 in Ex2, color 4 in Ex3)\n2. The output is the size of one section\n3. The transformation appears to find elements that are either:\n   - Common to all sections (appearing in the same position across all)\n   - Unique patterns that appear in only one section (normalized/shifted)\n\n**For the test input:**\nThe 15\u00d715 grid doesn't have explicit separator columns. Looking at the structure, I can divide it into a 3\u00d73 arrangement of 5\u00d75 sections.\n\nExtracting the sections, I notice:\n- The center section (rows 5-9, cols 5-9) contains a distinctive cross/T-shaped pattern of 8s\n- Other sections have scattered single 8s\n\nThe center section (1,1) pattern:\n```\nRow 5: ..8..  (8 at position 2)\nRow 6: .888.  (8s at positions 1,2,3)\nRow 7: .8.8.  (8s at positions 1,3)\nRow 8: .....\nRow 9: .....\n```\n\nThis forms a unique cross-like shape that doesn't appear in other sections. Following the pattern from the examples where unique patterns from one section get output (sometimes normalized), the output should be this distinctive 5\u00d75 section pattern.\n\n**Output:**\n```\n6,6,8,6,6\n6,8,8,8,6\n6,8,6,8,6\n6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,8,6,6\n      6,8,8,8,6\n      6,8,6,8,6\n      6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"4\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### Inferred transformation (from the examples)\n\n1. **Identify the background color**: it is the most frequent color in the grid (Examples: 1\u2192`1`, 2\u2192`0`, 3\u2192`5`).  \n2. **Identify the foreground color**: the main non-background color that forms scattered marks/objects (Examples: 1\u2192`4`, 2\u2192`3`, 3\u2192`6`).  \n3. **Find connected components of the foreground color** (treating cells as connected by **4-neighborhood**: up/down/left/right).\n4. **Select the single largest connected component** (the \u201creal\u201d object).

The initial approach was a detailed analysis of the given grids, looking for separators, color patterns, and attempting to deduce an operation (AND, OR, XOR) to generate the output from the input sections.\n\nI quickly realized the examples likely involve *object extraction*. Specifically, the task is to identify shapes or objects that are present in the input and then \"denoise\" or \"filter\" out all the other patterns. I needed to extract the correct object.  For Ex 1, the Caret shape was most prominent, even though it was within other dots.\n\nI moved on to Ex 2, and again, the task seemed to center around *shape recognition and preservation*. A key observation was the symmetry of preferred shapes. If a symmetric shape exists, it is more likely to be the one extracted and shown in the output. I also realized that the location of the object in the output may relate to the position of similar objects in the input.\n\nEx 3 proved insightful, revealing connections within the extracted objects. I suspected some overlaying or combining of sections.  The output shape, a 'Y', prompted a closer look at object formation and connections.\n\nThe Test Input, unlike the examples, had no clear separators and lacked distinct sections. The object here was the most coherent shape. The \"Space Invader\" shape popped out. From the examples I knew I had to locate it and then remove noise.\n\nI reevaluated my understanding of the problem.  The key takeaway from the examples was that the task is *denoising, pattern extraction, and in particular, symmetric shape extraction*.  \n\nMy final plan was to identify the dominant shape (the Space Invader), isolate its pixels (using the image), and create a 15x15 output grid that has that shape, and then populate the rest with the background color. Position is kept. Symmetry is central.\n\n\nThe goal of this task is to identify a specific \"object\" or pattern hidden within a noisy grid and isolate it, removing all other \"noise\" pixels.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** The input grid is divided into three vertical sections. Each section contains scattered yellow pixels (4) on a blue background (1).\n    *   **Observation:** Section 1 contains a distinct caret `^` shape formed by three pixels: `(1,1)`, `(2,3)`, `(2,5)` (relative to section start? No, coordinates relative to the shape's bounding box are `(0,1)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,2)`). The output grid isolates this `^` shape, preserving its relative position from the first section. Other scattered pixels are removed.\n2.  **Example 2:** The input has four sections.\n    *   **Observation:** Several shapes are present. Section 4 contains an upright `T` shape. Section 1 contains an inverted `T`. Sections 2 and 3 contain `L` shapes. The output grid shows only the upright `T` shape. The position in the output `(row 5)` matches the row of the object in Section 1, while the shape matches Section 4. This suggests finding a \"significant\" shape (perhaps the most symmetric or \"upright\" one) and placing it.\n3.  **Example 3:** The input has two sections.\n    *   **Observation:** The output is a `Y` shape. This shape is symmetric. The task involves filtering out the random noise pixels and keeping the coherent, symmetric object.\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\n1.  **Identify the Object:** Scan the grid for connected components of the pattern color. In the examples, the \"correct\" object is a coherent, symmetric shape (like `^`, `T`, `Y`). Random isolated pixels or non-symmetric clusters are treated as noise.\n2.  **Remove Noise:** Clear all pixels that are not part of the identified object, setting them to the background color.\n3.  **Preserve Position:** In the absence of multiple sections conflicting on position (as seen in Example 2), the object remains in its original coordinates.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Properties:** 15x15 grid. Background color is Magenta (6). Pattern color is Teal (8). There are no vertical separators.\n*   **Object Search:** We look for connected components of color 8.\n    *   Rows 1, 3, 8, 13 contain isolated or sparsely paired pixels (noise).\n    *   Rows 5, 6, 7 contain a cluster centered around `(6,7)`.\n        *   Row 5: Pixel at `(5,7)`.\n        *   Row 6: Pixels at `(6,6), (6,7), (6,8)`. (Note: pixels at `4` and `10` are not connected to this central mass).\n        *   Row 7: Pixels at `(7,6), (7,8)`.\n*   **Shape Identification:** The connected pixels form a symmetric figure resembling a \"space invader\" or stick figure:\n    ```\n      8\n     888\n     8 8\n    ```\n    This is the only significant symmetric connected object in the grid.\n*   **Construction:** We create a 15x15 grid filled with the background color (6). We then place the pixels of the identified object at their original coordinates.\n    *   `(5,7)` -> 8\n    *   `(6,6), (6,7), (6,8)` -> 8\n    *   `(7,6), (7,8)` -> 8\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n*   Rows 0-4: All 6.\n*   Row 5: `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6`\n*   Row 6: `6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6`\n*   Row 7: `6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6`\n*   Rows 8-14: All 6.\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_5_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to understand the pattern from the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Input has 26 columns with dividers (color 3) at columns 8 and 17, creating 3 panels of 8 columns each.

Inside the panels there are:\n   - A dominant **background color**.\n   - One **foreground color** (the \u201cink\u201d pixels).\n   - A special **anchor pixel**: a foreground pixel that appears in *every* panel at the *same relative coordinate* and is **isolated** (no neighboring foreground pixels in its 8-neighborhood).  \n     If several qualify, pick the **topmost, then leftmost**.\n\n3. Each panel also contains one main **foreground component** (8-connected).  \n   We select the component (over all panels) whose **closest pixel is nearest to the anchor** (Manhattan distance). (If only one panel, this just means \u201cpick the largest component excluding the anchor\u201d.)\n\n4. That selected component has a clear **\u201ctip side\u201d**: in its bounding box, one edge has *fewer* foreground pixels than the opposite edge (often 1 vs 2 or 3). That edge indicates whether the component is pointing **up/down/left/right**.\n\n5. The component is **rotated** so that:\n   - If the anchor is closer to the **top** than the bottom, the component\u2019s tip should point **up** (so the bulk lies below the anchor).\n   - If the anchor is closer to the **bottom**, the tip should point **down**.\n\n6. After rotation, the component is **translated** so that its **tip pixel** lands exactly on the anchor coordinate.  \n   The output grid is otherwise empty background (only this placed component remains).\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n- There are **no full-height separator columns**, so this is effectively **one panel** (output is also 15\u00d715).\n- Background color is **6**; foreground color is **8**.\n- The **anchor** (topmost-leftmost isolated 8) is at **(row 2, col 8)**.\n- The largest 8-connected component of 8\u2019s is the cluster around rows 6\u20138, cols 7\u20139 (6 pixels).  \n  Its bounding box shows the **tip is the single pixel on the top edge** (so it already points **up**), matching the \u201canchor near top \u21d2 tip up\u201d rule.\n- Translate this component so its tip (originally at (6,8)) moves to the anchor (2,8): shift **up by 4 rows**.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_7_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**The Puzzle of the Panels**\n\nMy mission, should I choose to accept it (and I have), is to decipher these ARC puzzles. The gist seems to be that we're given a set of grids\u2014the inputs\u2014often divided into vertical sections. There's a \"test\" input, too. The outputs are smaller grids that somehow represent a distillation or recombination of these input sections.\n\nMy initial thought is that the solution involves identifying and manipulating \"signals\" within the grids and that separator lines help define sections. The outputs appear to be made of particular shapes, so I'll try to find those shapes in the inputs.\n\nLet's dive into the examples. Example 1 has vertical separators, which divide a large input grid into panels. I begin by analyzing this example, focusing on the distinct patterns within these panels, particularly where the color \"4\" appears. The problem is complicated by noise, which makes it hard to quickly see a pattern.\n\nA \"common\" idea appears in the outputs, and I wonder if the goal is to determine the shape that the input panels *share*. I then consider shapes that the input panels have that the outputs do *not*. A variety of logical combinations, like XOR and looking at pixels present in exactly one input panel, seemed promising but, I concluded, led nowhere.\n\nSo I look closer, and notice that the output is some transformed version of the input, and try a theory that the \"correct\" panel is the one with the vertically symmetric component. I note the output shape and seek for the same in the input panels, and, after much consideration, settle on finding the unique shape in the input grids and extracting it. I also consider transformations such as flipping and positioning of an isolated shape.\n\nThe test input has no panels, just a single grid. The same principles should apply, so I look at this particular pattern and its relationship to the example and consider what the \"object\" might be. I also consider what this object's relationship to the overall shape of the board, and which edge of the board the object is likely to align.\n\nThe objective seems clear: I must find the symmetric shapes! The object is the connected component I seek, and I must flip the object if it is an inverted shape and align it to a new location. With this logic, I believe I can decode all the puzzles!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on patterns found in the solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Identify the Object:** In each example, there is a \"signal\" panel containing a vertically symmetric connected component (the object), while other panels contain noise or partial shapes.\n    *   Example 1 (Yellow `4`): Panel 2 contains a symmetric `V` shape. The output contains an upright `^` shape. (Flipped).\n    *   Example 2 (Green `3`): Panel 2 contains a symmetric Inverted `T` shape. Panel 4 contains a symmetric Upright `T`. The output contains an Upright `T`. (If derived from P2, it's flipped).\n    *   Example 3 (Pink `6`): Panel 2 contains a symmetric `Arrow` shape. The output contains the same `Arrow` shape. (Not flipped).\n    *   **Rule for Object:** Find the symmetric shape. Ensure it is \"upright\" (e.g., pointed top, or head at top). The `V` and Inverted `T` are considered \"inverted\" and are flipped. The `Arrow` and Upright `T` are kept as is.\n\n2.  **Identify the Position:** The final position of the object in the output grid seems to be determined by \"guide\" or \"noise\" pixels present in the first panel (or the grid itself).\n    *   Example 1: There is a noise pixel at `(1, 1)` in Panel 1. The output object's top-center is placed at `(1, 1)`.\n    *   Example 3: There is a noise pixel at `(0, 5)` in Panel 1. The output object's top-center is placed at `(0, 5)`.\n    *   Example 2: The output object is at Row 5. There is a noise pixel at `(5, 4)` in Panel 1. The object is centered horizontally at 4, so its top aligns with `(5, 4)`. (Green objects might align to the lowest guide pixel, or follow a falling gravity rule, but Cyan is likely to follow the Yellow/Pink \"floating\" behavior).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Grid Analysis:** The input is a single 15x15 grid (no separators). Background is Pink (6), Foreground is Cyan (8).\n2.  **Object Extraction:** There is a symmetric shape formed by Cyan (8) pixels in the lower half (Rows 5-7), centered at Column 7.\n    *   Shape structure:\n        *   Row 5: Pixel at col 7.\n        *   Row 6: Pixels at cols 6, 7, 8.\n        *   Row 7: Pixels at cols 6, 8.\n    *   This forms a \"Space Invader\" or \"Bug\" shape:\n        ```\n          8\n         888\n         8 8\n        ```\n    *   This shape is already \"upright\" (head at top, legs at bottom), similar to the `Arrow` in Example 3. So, **no flip** is needed.\n\n3.  **Positioning:** We look for the \"guide\" pixel in the noise.\n    *   The noise pixels are scattered around the grid (e.g., at (1,7), (1,11), (3,3), etc.).\n    *   Based on the \"floating\" behavior of non-green objects (Ex 1 & 3), we look for the **topmost** guide pixel.\n    *   The topmost noise pixel is at **Row 1, Column 7**.\n    *   Therefore, we place the top-center of our object at **(1, 7)**.\n\n4.  **Construction:**\n    *   Create a 15x15 grid filled with background (6).\n    *   Draw the object such that its top pixel is at `(1, 7)`.\n    *   Coordinates of object relative to top-center `(r, c)`:\n        *   Top: `(r, c)`\n        *   Middle: `(r+1, c-1), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+1)`\n        *   Bottom: `(r+2, c-1), (r+2, c+1)`\n    *   Target `(r, c) = (1, 7)`.\n    *   Pixels to set to 8:\n        *   `(1, 7)`\n        *   `(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)`\n        *   `(3, 6), (3, 8)`\n\n**Output Grid:**\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n...

It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, select the **single most detailed and logical** explanation.\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most rigorous and complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - best grounded in the grid data.\n  3.

Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2.
