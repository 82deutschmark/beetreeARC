        "Full raw LLM response": "**Solution Summary for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. The user's given me a task: solve an ARC problem that involves understanding a visual transformation rule and applying it. Essentially, I'm given some input grids, and the goal is to figure out the \"how\" and then generate the corresponding output for a new input.\n\nI kicked things off by diving into the provided examples. The first one was a good start \u2013 it had this little cross-shaped pattern made of 8s (teal) in a black grid. The output was a much more elaborate pattern, like a ripple or concentric rings of 8s. My job was to figure out the connection between the input and output. I started by getting a sense of coordinates and identifying the center of the cross. Then I attempted to map it to the expanded shape.\n\nI began thinking about coordinate distances and symmetries. I tried finding the patterns in the 8s and 0s in the output, looking at horizontal, vertical, and diagonal patterns. My working theory became: there's some kind of expansion, maybe based on distance from the center. I realized I could use the Chebyshev distance (max of horizontal and vertical distance from the center). This helped me consider concentric square \"shells\" of activity.\n\nMy hypothesis was getting tighter: the input image defines a \"seed\" (in this case, the cross), that controls an output ripple based on distances. I noticed that the input cross had arms of a length I labeled $L$. So my pattern depended on the arm length of the cross as a parameter. Next, I took a closer look at a new Example, and started noticing a clear connection between the input's $L$ and the resulting output grid's arrangement. For each Example, I analyzed the pattern of 8s, looking for consistent rules.\n\nI noticed a specific structure: an area filled in by 8s, and then 0s. The walls had thickness 1 (in number of cells), and gaps had thickness $(L-1)$. Then, the key insight: the number of cells from the center, $d$, determines whether it's an 8 or 0. The output follows $L$. Now I was ready to define some rules that should apply to every case.\n\nI worked to formalize these observations and proposed my algorithm: the output depends on $d = (c-c_c) + (r-r_c)$ where $L$. I realized that the value of any pixel depended on whether its distance from the center met a particular condition. It felt like the output image had a \"Checkerboard\" feel, and I considered parity and modulo operations to find a working rule. Then, I needed to figure out how to generate the spiral pattern, and its rule.\n\nI noticed that the diagonals alternate 0 and 8, but, on the axis, it depended on the current $L$.\n\nSo I formalized my idea into a plan of attack: identify the spiral of 8s and build the output grid step-by-step. The $L$ is a parameter that gives you the period of the pattern.\n\nOkay, I could make it work using these: first, the distance, then a checkerboard algorithm, and then applying a set rule to fill the grid.\n\nNow it's time to test it with the test input, and carefully fill in the new output grid. Let's start building it, cell by cell, based on the identified pattern. I then did some extra checks just to be sure. I'm ready to write the code.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to infer a transformation rule from three solved examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n1.  **Input Pattern:**\n    *   All inputs contain a single cross-shaped pattern made of `8`s (teal) on a background of `0`s (black).\n    *   This cross can be characterized by its **Center** $(r_c, c_c)$ and its **Arm Length** $L$.\n    *   **Example 1:** A small cross centered at $(4, 5)$ with arm length $L=1$. (Neighbors are `8`, corners are `0`).\n    *   **Example 2:** A large cross centered at $(9, 9)$ (inferred from symmetry) with arm length $L=3$. The arms are 3 cells long.\n    *   **Example 3:** A medium cross centered at $(7, 6)$ with arm length $L=2$.\n\n2.  **Output Pattern:**\n    *   The output is a pattern of concentric square rings centered at $(r_c, c_c)$.\n    *   The rings are composed of `8`s and `0`s.\n    *   **Ring Locations:** Rings appear at specific Chebyshev distances $d$ (maximum of horizontal and vertical distance) from the center.\n        *   In Example 1 ($L=1$), rings are at $d = 1, 2, 3, 4...$ (Every distance).\n        *   In Example 2 ($L=3$), rings are at $d = 1, 4, 7...$ (Distances $1, 1+3, 1+6...$).\n        *   In Example 3 ($L=2$), rings are at $d = 1, 3, 5...$ (Distances $1, 1+2, 1+4...$).\n    *   **Rule:** Rings exist at distances $d$ satisfying $(d - 1) \\pmod L == 0$. That is, $d = 1 + k \\cdot L$ for $k = 0, 1, 2...$\n    *   **Ring Pattern (Values):**\n        *   On the rings, the values alternate between `8` and `0` (checkerboard pattern along the perimeter).\n        *   The phase of this alternation is determined by the ring index $k$.\n        *   **Corner Rule:**\n            *   If $k$ is **even** ($0, 2, 4...$), the corners of the square ring are `0`.\n            *   If $k$ is **odd** ($1, 3, 5...$), the corners of the square ring are `8`.\n        *   The sides of the square are filled by alternating `8` and `0` starting from the corners. Since the side length ($2d+1$) is always odd, the start and end corners of a side have the same parity and value, ensuring consistency.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Input Features:**\n    *   The input grid is $26 \\times 26$.\n    *   The pattern is a cross.\n    *   Vertical bar is at column 10 (0-indexed). It spans rows 8-11 and 13-16.\n    *   Horizontal bar is at row 12. It spans columns 6-9 and 11-14.\n    *   Intersection (Center) is at **Row 12, Column 10**.\n    *   The length of the arms (from center neighbor to tip) is 4 cells (e.g., cols 11, 12, 13, 14).\n    *   So, $Center = (12, 10)$ and $L = 4$.\n\n2.  **Generate Output Grid:**\n    *   We create a $26 \\times 26$ grid of `0`s.\n    *   We apply rings at distances $d = 1 + 4k$.\n    *   **Ring $k=0$ ($d=1$):**\n        *   $k$ is even $\\rightarrow$ Corners are `0`.\n        *   Bounds: Rows $[11, 13]$, Cols $[9, 11]$.\n        *   Perimeter pattern (alternating from corner `0`): `0, 8, 0`.\n        *   Top (Row 11): `0` (col 9), `8` (col 10), `0` (col 11).\n        *   Bottom (Row 13): `0, 8, 0`.\n        *   Left (Col 9): `0` (row 11), `8` (row 12), `0` (row 13).\n        *   Right (Col 11): `0, 8, 0`.\n    *   **Ring $k=1$ ($d=5$):**\n        *   $k$ is odd $\\rightarrow$ Corners are `8`.\n        *   Bounds: Rows $[7, 17]$, Cols $[5, 15]$.\n        *   Perimeter pattern (alternating from corner `8`): `8, 0, 8, 0...`\n        *   Top (Row 7, cols 5-15): `8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8`.\n        *   Bottom (Row 17, cols 5-15): `8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8`.\n        *   Sides follow the same alternating pattern.\n    *   **Ring $k=2$ ($d=9$):**\n        *   $k$ is even $\\rightarrow$ Corners are `0`.\n        *   Bounds: Rows $[3, 21]$, Cols $[1, 19]$.\n        *   Perimeter pattern: `0, 8, 0, 8...`\n        *   Top (Row 3, cols 1-19): Starts and ends with `0`.\n    *   **Ring $k=3$ ($d=13$):**\n        *   $k$ is odd $\\rightarrow$ Corners are `8`.\n        *   Bounds: Rows $[-1, 25]$, Cols $[-3, 23]$.\n        *   This ring is partially off-grid.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**The Task and Initial Observations**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I have to figure out the pattern in an input grid and apply it to a new one.  I've got three example inputs and a test case.  My first thought is to analyze the examples to find the underlying logic. In the first example, I see a small cross shape, which I quickly determine is a hollow diamond, and an output that looks like a spiraling or concentric square pattern around a central point.  I have to note the coordinates are zero-indexed, which is very important. I notice that the central diamond shape is preserved but, is the center 8, or 0?  I begin to look at the details.\n\n**Decoding Example 1**\n\nLooking closely, I see the output has a core of teal \"8\"s which match my input, but also extra ones.  This seems related to concentric square rings. I spend a lot of time retracing the spiral path of the \"8\"s to see how they grow outwards from the input shape.  A key detail is identifying the center, because it defines how to generate the output.  The output shape looks like a wave.\n\n**Analyzing Example 2 and Identifying Patterns**\n\nThe second example is bigger, with a larger cross shape. The output is again a spiral, and I am noting if the input parts are perfectly in the output shape. I want to know if the size matters. I confirm that the cross shape is again preserved in the output. I start trying to connect the arms of the cross with the spiral to see if the spiral is just growing from the ends of the cross arms.  I start noticing the spiral or concentric pattern might skip intermediate rings. The arms of the cross play a role in this skipped ring pattern.\n\n**Understanding the Relationship**\n\nIt seems the output is a set of \"rings\" - it is the rings that have a pattern. This leads me to try an \"alternating ring\" model. I think about how the input shape is related to the generation of the concentric pattern. The number of rings seems important.\n\n**Generalization and the Broken Arm Pattern**\n\nI realize that the pattern is based on concentric rings, but not every one is filled. I start mapping the parity of the ring distances to the output values, trying to map to horizontal or vertical walls in the spiral.  Here is where the key detail comes in- the input cross is modified by the output spiral. At this point, I realize that for the spiral to be generated there has to be a specific rule.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nI find that for an even arm length L, the arms are \"broken.\"  I find the algorithm, I think: Generate the concentric spiral from the center.\n\nI have it! I've developed the rules and can now apply it to the test input.\n\nI create the grid.\n\nThen, for each location (x, y):\n* Calculate distance $d$ from the center to (x, y).\n\nThen, based on the even/odd nature of d and whether it is a vertical or horizontal part of the ring, assign the output value. The value is either 8 or 0.\n\nThe transformation rule creates a pattern of concentric square rings centered at the intersection of the cross arms in the input grid. The phase (filled vs. empty) of the rings depends on the distance from the center and the parity of the ring index. For tasks where the arm length $L$ is even (like Example 3 and the Test Input), the input arms are \"broken\" into dashes by this pattern.\n\nThe algorithm to generate the output pixel at $(y, x)$ is:\n1.  Identify the center $(cy, cx)$ of the cross shape from the input. For the test input, the center is at **Row 12, Column 10** (0-indexed).\n2.  Calculate the Chebyshev distance $d = \\max(|x - cx|, |y - cy|)$.\n3.  Apply the ring rules:\n    *   **Center ($d=0$):** Value is 0.\n    *   **Vertical Walls** (where $|x - cx| = d$):\n        *   If $d$ is **Even**: Value is **8** (Teal).\n        *   If $d$ is **Odd**: Value is **0** (Black).\n            *   *Exception:* If $d=1$ and the pixel is on the horizontal axis ($y = cy$), value is **8**.\n    *   **Horizontal Walls** (where $|y - cy| = d$ and $|x - cx| < d$):\n        *   If $d$ is **Odd**: Value is **8**.\n        *   If $d$ is **Even**: Value is **0**.\n\nApplying this to the 26x26 test input centered at (12, 10):\n\noutput:\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can see a pattern:\n1. There's a cross shape made of 8s in the input with a 0 at the center\n2. The output creates a spiral pattern emanating from this cross\n3. The spiral expands outward from the cross, creating alternating lines of 8s and 0s\n4. The cross is preserved in the output\n5. Each \"layer\" of the spiral connects to the next, creating a continuous rectangular spiral pattern\n\nFor the test input:\n- Grid size: 26\u00d726\n- Cross center: row 12, column 10 (with 0 at center)\n- Vertical arm: column 10, rows 8-16 (with gap at row 12)\n- Horizontal arm: row 12, columns 6-14 (with gap at column 10)\n- Arm length: 4 (four 8s in each direction)\n\nThe spiral pattern starts from this cross and expands outward, creating nested rectangular frames that connect to form a continuous spiral. Each layer alternates between 8s and 0s.\n\n```\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The input contains a single \u201chub\u201d: one **0** cell that is surrounded in the four cardinal directions by color **8**, with longer straight \u201carms\u201d of 8 extending outward.  \nFrom the examples, the output is not a local modification of that hub; instead, the hub\u2019s color (8) is used to build a **global, deterministic labyrinth/spiral wall pattern** across the whole grid, while preserving the hub\u2019s center as 0 and keeping the original arms as 8.\n\nA direct way to reconstruct the same kind of global structure is:\n\n1. **Create an empty output grid** (all 0).\n2. **Draw a rectangular spiral \u201cwall\u201d of 8s** from the outside inward, leaving a 1-cell corridor (so the spiral steps inward by 2 each layer). Concretely, with boundaries `(top,bottom,left,right)`:\n   - draw the left boundary from `top` to `bottom`\n   - draw the bottom boundary from `left` to `right`\n   - draw the right boundary upward but stop 2 cells short of `top` (so the spiral can continue inward)\n   - draw the row at `top+2` from `right` back to `left+2`\n   - then shrink the rectangle by 2 on all sides and repeat\n3. **Overlay the given hub arms** (keep all input 8s as 8).\n4. **Force the hub center cell back to 0** (the center of the plus).\n\nApplying that to the test input (hub center at row 12, column 10; arm color 8) gives:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",
