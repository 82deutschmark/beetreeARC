        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Strategy for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. The core is figuring out the transformations applied to grid-based objects. The main strategy is to analyze a few examples with inputs and their corresponding outputs. And try to understand the pattern.\n\nIt looks like the key is understanding how moveable objects interact with fixed objects. And the fixed objects are not transformed. I'm thinking of it in terms of \"fixed\" and \"moveable\" components.\n\nI'm focused on the color of the objects. Each grid cell has a value, indicating the color or background.\nIn the examples, I see shapes in the input grid, and those shapes change position/shape in the output. The shapes are represented by a distinct color.\n\nNow, going through the examples and their inputs and outputs:\nIn the first example, I see that the yellow object moved upwards and to the right, adjacent to the existing shapes. My first thought is \"gravity\". \n\nIn the second example, a green object moves upwards and connects with a fixed object at the top. This reinforces the idea of movement being towards the other objects.\n\nIn the third example, the moveable object connects two fixed objects, almost like a chain. In the fourth example, the moveable object hugs the walls and moves upwards.\n\nIn the fifth example, it's the same pattern of connecting and moving upwards or filling a particular region.\n\nSo I think the pattern is this: There are \"fixed\" objects (walls, obstacles, boundaries) and one moveable object. The moveable object moves and touches the fixed object in a specific way. It looks like the moveable objects *fill the space* in a way adjacent to the walls. In some way the moveable object's pixels *climb up* and are placed against the wall. It also depends on which side of the wall it clings to.\n\nI formulated a \"Taut String\" or \"Elastic Band\" model, like the pixels are pulled. And the number of output pixels in the moveable object is less than input in some examples. This may mean that the new position of a pixel could be blocked or merged with the wall. The output of the moveable object is often a continuous chain.\n\nSo the rule is the moveable object (pixels) get moved and placed in adjacent or connected locations to the walls/obstacles. \"Adjacent\" is important! The exact adjacent locations might be on the left or the right side of the wall. It depends. It seems the direction the pixels travel might depend on their initial layout and the shape of the obstacles. They fill to the left or right of walls.\n\nGoing back to Example 4 and Example 5. It looks like the algorithm is \"Climbing the walls on the left\".\n\nI then try to apply the hypothesis to the new Test Input. The goal is to figure out the output given the input grid. I identify Teal as a diagonal line, Green a horizontal line, Blue a vertical, and Magenta a single dot, as walls. And Yellow as the moveable object.\n\nI realized that the Yellow pixels are at the bottom, and the Teal and Green are at the top and form a ceiling. It seems the path follows up from the Yellows, which are pushed under the ceiling.\n\nSo I need to locate where Yellow can move. It adheres to the left, which implies a \"right path\" to climb. There is a \"passage\" or a \"channel\" from the lower Yellow. This must be a path between the fixed objects. The pixels should follow \"Right\" side of Teal and Green.\n\nIt has the most space, between the Teal, Green, and the two Right-side walls (Blue and Magenta).\n\nThe problem then is \"How many rows should I fill\"? Can I reach the Magenta? The Blue? Is there an overlap problem?\nI formulated a rule \"Move the Yellow up by adhering to the closest fixed (Right) Wall\". It should be the \"Left-most\" path possible.\n\nNow the question is how long to extend the Yellow. The pixels should be pushed from the Yellow towards the diagonal Teal. The new output should form a chain hugging the bottom of Teal.\n\nI count the Teal line. Count the Yellow pixels. The shape needs to make the maximum use of the pixels, by filling under the walls or obstacles. In the end, it forms a chain from the Yellow to the top. The yellow object fills a particular area, or follows a specific path. In this instance, the yellow object has a limited path.\n\nThe plan is this. There is a path by the Teal object. Starting from the bottom, the Yellow object ascends to this path, forming the output. And I can identify all pixels.\n\nThe transformation involves moving the \"moveable\" object (the Yellow pixels, color 4) from the bottom of the grid to a new position defined by the \"fixed\" objects (Teal lines, Green lines, etc.). The moveable object behaves like a gas or a chain that rises to the top of the grid (Row 0) and conforms to the contours of the fixed obstacles.\n\nSpecifically, the rule inferred from the examples (especially Examples 4 and 5) is:\n1.  **Identify Fixed vs. Moveable:** The Yellow pixels (4) are the moveable object. The Teal (8), Green (3), Blue (1), Magenta (6), and Maroon (9) pixels act as fixed obstacles.\n2.  **Determine Path:** The moveable pixels rise to Row 0. They align themselves adjacent to the \"walls\" formed by the fixed objects.\n    *   In the Test Input, there is a continuous \"Left Wall\" formed by the Teal (8) pixels from Row 1 to Row 7 and the Green (3) pixels at Row 8.\n    *   The Teal pixels are at (1,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,3), (6,4), (7,5).\n    *   The stream of Yellow pixels adheres to the **Right** side of this Left Wall (filling the adjacent empty cells).\n3.  **Calculate Positions:** We calculate the target slots starting from Row 0 downwards.\n    *   Row 0: Extrapolating the Teal line (1,1) upwards gives a virtual wall at (0,0). The slot to its right is **(0,1)**.\n    *   Row 1: Teal is at (1,1). Slot to the right is **(1,2)**.\n    *   Row 2: Teal is at (2,2). Slot to the right is **(2,3)**.\n    *   Row 3: Teal is at (3,2). Slot to the right is **(3,3)**.\n    *   Row 4: Teal is at (4,2). Slot to the right is **(4,3)**.\n    *   Row 5: Teal is at (5,3). Slot to the right is **(5,4)**.\n    *   Row 6: Teal is at (6,4). Slot to the right is (6,5).\n4.  **Move Pixels:** There are exactly 6 Yellow pixels in the input. We fill the top 6 calculated slots: (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,4).\n5.  **Clean Up:** The original Yellow pixels at the bottom are removed (replaced with background color 5). All fixed objects remain unchanged.\n\nOutput Grid Construction:\n- Start with a grid of 5s (Background).\n- Place Fixed Objects:\n  - Teal (8) at (1,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,3), (6,4), (7,5), (7,6).\n  - Green (3) at Row 8 (cols 0-6).\n  - Maroon (9) block at Rows 4-6, cols 10-13.\n  - Magenta (6) at (17,7).\n  - Blue (1) vertical line at col 8, starting Row 18.\n- Place New Yellow (4) pixels at: **(0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,4)**.\n\n5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,8,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,8,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,8,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,8,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,8,4,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,8,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**The Core Idea: Horizontal Compaction with Vertical Ordering**\n\nI'm tackling an ARC problem with a \"gravity-like\" transformation. The general pattern seems to be that everything gets \"pulled\" horizontally towards a vertical \"wall\" (a column of unchanging pixels). The challenge is figuring out how the objects stack up vertically after this compaction.\n\nI started by analyzing the examples, focusing on identifying the wall and how objects move relative to it. I realized the objects don't necessarily need to be directly connected to the wall in the input. Instead, the transformation seems to apply to all objects.\n\nOne of the key observations: the objects, after this gravity-like movement, are often vertically aligned in a way that relates to the \"wall\". Sometimes it creates a clear vertical line, or a shape against the wall. This suggested a sorting or stacking principle. I was initially thrown off by cases where the output shape seemed irregular.\n\nAfter exploring several possibilities, I've arrived at a more refined hypothesis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Anchor/Wall column.** This is the column with the vertical segment of unchanging pixels.\n2.  **Determine the direction of gravity.** Objects to the left of the wall move to the right, and objects to the right of the wall move to the left.\n3.  **Horizontal compaction**: All objects move horizontally towards the target column (the one adjacent to the wall)\n4.  **Vertical ordering**: The key is the vertical arrangement, which is either:\n\n    1.  **Reflection + Gravity (Main approach):** This rule is, objects below some connection points (4s) will be reflected across horizontal axis, while objects above, such as 8s, are not and maintain vertical locations\n    2.  **Straightening + Filling**: The objects seem to be \"unwound\" or \"unfurled\" from their original shape and then stacked in a single vertical column.\n\nIn many cases, applying my main approach of a horizontal slide towards the target combined with reflection creates the exact output transformation. When reflection isn't perfect, I look at simple shape stacking logic.\n\n\nThe problem involves transforming a grid containing various objects (connected components of non-background pixels) and a \"wall\" structure. Based on the provided examples, the transformation follows a specific set of physical-like rules:\n\n1.  **Identify the Anchor Wall:** In each example, there is a vertical segment of pixels that remains fixed (or defines the target position). In the test input, this is the vertical line of **1s** at **Column 8** (spanning Rows 18-21).\n\n2.  **Chain Reflection (Unfolding):** Objects connected to the wall behave like a hanging chain or hinged structure.\n    *   Find the \"connection point\" or \"root\" row where the object attaches to the top of the wall. In the test input, the **4s** attach to the **1s** at **Row 18**.\n    *   Pixels forming the \"chain\" below this connection point are **vertically reflected** upwards around the root row.\n        *   Equation: $y_{new} = y_{root} - (y_{old} - y_{root})$.\n    *   Pixels above the connection point (like the **6**, **8s**, **3s**, **9s**) maintain their original row indices.\n\n3.  **Horizontal Gravity (Compaction):** All objects slide horizontally towards the Anchor Wall until they are adjacent to the wall or another object (forming a compact stack).\n    *   Objects to the left of the wall (8s, 3s, 4s, 6) slide **Right** to stack against the wall (Column 7).\n    *   Objects to the right of the wall (9s) slide **Left** to stack against the wall (Column 9).\n    *   The relative horizontal order of objects in the same row is preserved during compaction.\n\n**Applying these rules to the Test Input:**\n\n*   **Wall (1s):** Remains at **(18,8), (19,8), (20,8), (21,8)**.\n*   **4s (Yellow):**\n    *   Root is Row 18.\n    *   Pixels at Row 18: **(18,6), (18,7)** remain at Row 18. Slide to **(18,6), (18,7)** against the wall.\n    *   Pixels at Row 19: **(19,3), (19,4), (19,5)** reflect to Row 17 ($18 - (19-18) = 17$). They slide right to fill columns next to the 6.\n    *   Pixel at Row 20: **(20,2)** reflects to Row 16 ($18 - (20-18) = 16$). Slides right to **(16,7)**.\n*   **6 (Magenta):**\n    *   Located at **(17,7)**. Above root, stays at Row 17. Stays at Column 7.\n    *   *Row 17 Composition:* Contains reflected 4s and the static 6. The 6 is at Col 7. The 4s (3 pixels) fill Cols 4, 5, 6.\n*   **3s (Green):**\n    *   Row 8 contains 7 pixels. Above root, stays Row 8. Slide right to occupy **(8,1)** to **(8,7)**.\n*   **8s (Light Blue):**\n    *   Rows 1-6 contain 1 pixel each. Slide right to **Col 7**.\n    *   Row 7 contains 2 pixels. Slide right to **Cols 6, 7**.\n*   **9s (Maroon):**\n    *   Located to the right of the wall. Slide Left to target **Col 9**.\n    *   Row 4 (2 pixels): **(4,9), (4,10)**.\n    *   Row 5 (3 pixels): **(5,9), (5,10), (5,11)**.\n    *   Row 6 (4 pixels): **(6,9), (6,10), (6,11), (6,12)**.\n*   **Background (5):** Fills the rest of the grid.\n\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,8,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,4,4,4,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What the solved examples show\n\nAcross the examples there are **three non-background colors**:\n- **Two \u201canchor\u201d objects** stay exactly where they are (often vertical lines, sometimes a single pixel or a small fixed shape).\n- The **third color is completely rearranged** into a very specific **chevron / bracket path** that is determined only by the anchors\u2019 geometry.\n\nThe chevron template is built like this:\n\n1. **Pick the two anchor objects** (the ones that do *not* get rearranged).\n2. Decide which anchor is the **short anchor** (the one with the smaller vertical span).  \n3. Let **d** be the **horizontal distance** (in columns) between the two anchors (measured between the sides that face each other).\n4. Build a path of the moved color:\n   - A **spine** running alongside the short anchor (one pixel per row of the short anchor\u2019s vertical span), placed on the side *away* from the other anchor.\n   - From the top and bottom of this spine, draw **diagonal arms** of length **d** toward the other anchor (slope \u00b11).\n5. The moved-color pixels are placed **along this template path starting from the end nearest the other anchor**.  \n   - If there are **fewer** pixels than the template length, you get only the first part of the path.\n   - If there are **more**, extras are discarded (as in examples 1 and 4).\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n- Background color is **5**.\n- The clear fixed anchors in the lower-right cluster are:\n  - **Color 1**: a vertical line at column 8, rows 18\u201321.\n  - **Color 6**: a single pixel at (row 17, col 7), diagonally above-left of the top of the 1-line.\n- The moved color is **4** (the scattered 4s near the anchors).\n\nCompute parameters:\n- Short anchor is the **single 6** (vertical span = just row 17).\n- The 1-line is to the **right** of the 6 by 1 column, so **d = 1**.\n\nTemplate for d=1 and a 1-row spine gives a 3-cell chevron:\n- Endpoint nearest the 1-line\u2019s top: **(18,7)**\n- Spine/apex (one left of the 6): **(17,6)**\n- Other arm endpoint: **(16,7)**\n\nSo:\n- Remove all existing **4** pixels.\n- Place **4** at **(16,7), (17,6), (18,7)**.\n- Leave everything else unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,8,5,5,5,5,5,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,8,8,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,4,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",
