        "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's the plan I've meticulously crafted to tackle this ARC task.** The user wants me to solve a visual pattern problem using three examples and a test input. It's a bit like tracing circuits, with colours instead of electrons.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic elements. The inputs have 3x3 colored blocks or shapes, a teal-colored structure, and the outputs have the same, with added patterns. I've realized the teal structure is a crucial wiring system, connecting source blocks with destination areas.\n\nLet's break down the types of blocks. There are the solid blocks (all one color), X-shaped blocks (corners and center), and the output Diamonds (sides). The solid blocks seem to 'transmit' their color to destination slots in the structure. \n\nThe first step, for me, is recognizing how the teal wiring system affects the colors. The color in a source block gets moved based on how the teal \"wires\" connect to it. Grey pixels are important. There is a specific order of patterns. Solid patterns on the top become Diamonds at the same spot, while empty parts get Xs at the output. \n\nFrom the examples, it seems like the teal wires cause swaps. Imagine an Amidakuji ladder. Each vertical line has a spot where a color is, which is a starting point, and has a finishing spot, which is the output spot. The goal is to determine the correct mapping for each color for the given test input. \n\nAnalyzing the test input, I identified the pattern. We have 4 color blocks, which are the main sources. Then, another source, which is at the end of the test input. There are specific spots for the color blocks, and those can then be swapped due to a shift. Using this, I can start applying these connections, while trying to determine the logic, if any. \n\nI've made a careful set of guesses and observed that the key is in the \"wiring\" and the location. It does not matter what the input blocks were, as the resulting color is based on where the source is, if that makes sense.\n\nBased on everything, the rule I think is: Source blocks become diamonds, and their colors move along the wires to fill other X-shaped regions, by swapping around the locations. I'm going to follow the existing wiring to see where these signals go. I will double-check the locations, and then generate the final output. The key will be ensuring the shapes (diamonds or Xs) are placed correctly in the right spots.\n\nI have it! I will begin by making a copy of the input grid, and overwrite specific areas to change source blocks to the right shapes, and generate the proper grid.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rules are as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Components:** The grid contains a teal (8) structure acting as a connecting network (wires) between \"sockets\".\n    *   **Top Sockets:** Located in the top rows (rows 2-4). They contain solid 3x3 blocks of color or are empty.\n    *   **Bottom Sockets:** Located in the bottom rows (rows 21-23). They can contain X-patterns of color or are empty.\n    *   **Static Elements:** The teal (8) wires, grey (5) connectors, and maroon (9) blocks act as the background structure and are preserved in the output.\n\n2.  **Determine Transformations for Sockets:**\n    *   **Top Sockets (Output):** Regardless of whether they were solid blocks or filled from elsewhere, the output pattern for top sockets is always a **Diamond** shape (single pixels at the center of the four edges).\n    *   **Bottom Sockets (Output):** The output pattern for bottom sockets is always an **X-shape** (pixels at the four corners and the center).\n\n3.  **Determine Color Permutation (The \"Logic\"):**\n    *   The network defines a permutation mapping input colors to output positions.\n    *   **Source Identification:** Identify all colors present in the Top Sockets and Bottom Sockets. In the Test Input:\n        *   Top Pos 1 (Cols 2-4): **1 (Blue)**\n        *   Top Pos 2 (Cols 7-9): **Empty**\n        *   Top Pos 3 (Cols 12-14): **2 (Red)**\n        *   Top Pos 4 (Cols 17-19): **3 (Green)**\n        *   Top Pos 5 (Cols 22-24): **6 (Magenta)**\n        *   Bottom Pos 5 (Cols 22-24): **4 (Yellow)**\n    *   **Top Row Filling:** The \"Gap\" in the Top row (Pos 2) is filled by the color found in the Bottom row (4). The existing Top colors stay in their respective columns.\n        *   Top Output Order: **1, 4, 2, 3, 6**.\n    *   **Bottom Row Permutation:** The network implements a specific swap logic, likely based on pair swaps and wire crossovers.\n        *   Left Pair (Pos 1 & 2): Swap. (Pos 1 gets 4, Pos 2 gets 1).\n        *   Center (Pos 3): Fixed. (Pos 3 gets 2).\n        *   Right Pair (Pos 4 & 5): Swap. (Pos 4 gets 6, Pos 5 gets 3).\n        *   Bottom Output Order: **4, 1, 2, 6, 3**.\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Copy the background (8s, 9s, 5s) from the input.\n    *   Draw **Diamonds** in rows 2-4 for the sequence **1, 4, 2, 3, 6**.\n    *   Draw **X-shapes** in rows 21-23 for the sequence **4, 1, 2, 6, 3**.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,1,0,1,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,6,0,6,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8,8,8,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,8,5,8,5,8,8,5,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,4,0,4,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,3,0,3,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0\n0,4,0,4,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,3,0,3,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Comprehensive Analysis and Strategy for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given three solved examples and need to deduce the underlying logic. Based on a deep dive into the provided examples, my thought process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Foundation:** The core idea seems to revolve around simulating a circuit or logic gate system. There are 'source' inputs, 'destination' outputs, and 'components' connecting them. The wires are a central component made of a color, 8 (teal). The core goal is to determine the state of the circuit based on the flow of the signals (which are also a color).\n\n2.  **Signal Propagation:** A solid block acts as a 'source' that generates and transmits the signal, while an X block serves as a passive port that can also emit signals. An empty spot suggests a terminal. The signal travels through the wires (8's). The key is tracking where the signal \"lands\" to determine if a signal is passed or switched.\n\n3.  **Key components:** the gray block ('5') and the maroon block ('9') act as operators to change the path of wires and interact with the signal flow.\n    *   **The 5 Block:** The '5' blocks seem to act as crossovers or swappers. A Horizontal wire passes the signal, and when intercepted by the 5 block, the wires and signals on both sides are swapped.\n    *   **The 9 Blocks:** The '9' Blocks appear to change the horizontal routing rules. The vertical wires have a tendency to go through the block, but horizontal wires can go around it.\n\n4.  **Transformation Logic:** A diamond marker means active/true. I will analyze how input solid blocks change to diamond and determine how this relates to their position/color.\n\n    *   Solid block (source): Solid -> Diamond (if signal is 'on'/'true').\n    *   X (or empty) that receives signal -> Diamond (if signal is 'on'/'true').\n    *   Wires: Conduct signals.\n    *   The aim is to figure out the rules behind how the signal moves through the circuit, especially focusing on how components like \"5\" and \"9\" modify the signal path.\n\n5.  **Test Input Application (Routing Puzzle):** I'll now apply what I've learned to a new test case. The goal is to predict what the output grid should look like based on tracing signals (the input colors) from source to destination, through the circuit's network of wires and gates. I should start by mapping how my input signal from 1, 2, 3, 6 sources. Based on the wiring, my assumption is that the signals are modified by specific rules, and this modification dictates the position of the signals in the output. I need to apply all the component rules to simulate each signal's journey and predict the output. This becomes a permutation, but a permutation modified by the wire system.\n\n    *   For the test case, I will apply a plan:\n        *   Reconstruct the grid.\n        *   Determine the destination for all signals based on tracing.\n\n            *   Source `1` (col 2) -> output at (col 7).\n            *   Source `2` (col 12) -> output at (col 17).\n            *   Source `3` (col 17) -> output at (col 12).\n            *   Source `6` (col 22) -> output at (col 22, will overwrite pre-existing `4` Diamond).\n\n        *   Transform top source blocks: Convert sources from Solid to Diamond.\n        *   Transform bottom outputs. Draw bottom Diamonds in respective positions, replacing existing elements.\n\n6.  **Edge Case Checks and Refinement:** If it's a cyclic shift of positions (2, 12, 17) -> (7, 17, 12).\n    *   Signal 1 (from 2) -> Port 7.\n    *   Signal 2 (from 12) -> Port 17.\n    *   Signal 3 (from 17) -> Port 12.\n\n7.  **Final Implementation:** I'll implement the solution by copying the input grid and modifying the relevant rows/columns to reflect the transformed grid, as derived by the above analysis.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where the grid simulates a digital circuit or routing network. The grid contains \"wires\" (represented by color 8, teal) connecting \"sources\" (solid 3x3 blocks at the top) to \"sockets\" or \"outputs\" (positions at the bottom). There are various components (colors 5, 9, 4) that modify the path or permute the signals.\n\n**Analysis of Logic:**\n\n1.  **Sources:** Solid 3x3 blocks of color $C$ in the input act as signal sources. In the output, these source blocks transform from a solid square to a diamond shape (a hollow cross).\n    *   Test Input Sources:\n        *   Color `1` (Blue) at Top-Left (Cols 1-3).\n        *   Color `2` (Red) at Top-Middle (Cols 11-13).\n        *   Color `3` (Green) at Top-Right (Cols 16-18).\n        *   Color `6` (Magenta) at Far-Right (Cols 21-23).\n\n2.  **Signals and Wires:** The signals travel downwards along the teal wires (`8`).\n    *   **Signal `1`** (from Col 2) travels down and encounters a horizontal wire at Row 9, moving it to the right towards Column 7 or 12. Detailed tracing and the presence of a swapper-like structure involving `9` blocks at the bottom-left suggests this signal is routed to the empty slot at **Column 7**.\n    *   **Signal `2`** (from Col 12) and **Signal `3`** (from Col 17) enter a swapping network (indicated by `5`s and horizontal wires at Rows 5 and 12). Based on Example 2 and 3 patterns, such networks typically swap adjacent or connected channels. Here, `2` and `3` are swapped.\n        *   Signal `2` goes to **Column 17**.\n        *   Signal `3` goes to **Column 12**.\n    *   **Signal `6`** (from Col 22) travels down, shifts left briefly, passes through a `9` block, but the output socket at the bottom of Column 22 (marked by `4`s) suggests it returns or stays in that channel. Thus, Signal `6` ends at **Column 22**.\n    *   **Column 2:** Since Signal `1` moved to Column 7, the output at Column 2 is empty/null.\n\n3.  **Outputs:** The destination sockets at the bottom (Rows 21-23) light up with the color of the signal reaching them. The shape is a Diamond pattern.\n    *   **Column 7:** Receives Signal `1`. Output: Diamond `1`.\n    *   **Column 12:** Receives Signal `3`. Output: Diamond `3`.\n    *   **Column 17:** Receives Signal `2`. Output: Diamond `2`.\n    *   **Column 22:** Receives Signal `6`. Output: Diamond `6` (overwriting the placeholder `4` pattern).\n\n**Transformation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Copy the input grid.**\n2.  **Transform Top Sources (Rows 1-3):**\n    *   Change Solid `1` (Cols 1-3) to Diamond `1`.\n    *   Change Solid `2` (Cols 11-13) to Diamond `2`.\n    *   Change Solid `3` (Cols 16-18) to Diamond `3`.\n    *   Change Solid `6` (Cols 21-23) to Diamond `6`.\n3.  **Generate Bottom Outputs (Rows 21-23):**\n    *   At Cols 6-8 (Center 7): Draw Diamond `1`.\n    *   At Cols 11-13 (Center 12): Draw Diamond `3`.\n    *   At Cols 16-18 (Center 17): Draw Diamond `2`.\n    *   At Cols 21-23 (Center 22): Draw Diamond `6`.\n    *   (Cols 1-3 remain empty/zeros as per input).\n\n**Diamond Pattern for 3x3 block (Center r, c):**\n*   $(r-1, c) = C$\n*   $(r, c-1) = C$\n*   $(r, c+1) = C$\n*   $(r+1, c) = C$\n*   Others = 0\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,3,0,3,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8,8,8,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,8,5,8,5,8,8,5,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,0,3,0,2,0,2,0,6,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation rules:\n\n1. **Solid 3x3 colored blocks become cross patterns** (plus-sign shape) - the solid squares are \"hollowed out\" into a cross pattern with the same color.\n\n2. **Existing cross patterns remain as crosses** (but may change shape type based on position).\n\n3. **Patterns propagate to symmetric positions** - colors from the top row appear at the bottom, and vice versa. The 5s on the 8-grid lines act as \"gates\" that determine how colors flow/propagate.\n\n4. **Top patterns use plus-sign crosses** (center plus 4 orthogonal points), while **bottom patterns use X-shaped crosses** (center plus 4 diagonal points).\n\n5. **Color permutation** - When reflecting colors from top to bottom, there's a rearrangement based on the gate structure. The existing 4-cross at bottom-right stays as an anchor, and other colors shift.\n\nFor the test input:\n- Top row has: 1 (col 2), 2 (col 12), 3 (col 17), 6 (col 22)\n- Bottom row has: 4 (col 22) - existing cross\n- Col 7 is empty but part of the grid structure\n\nAfter transformation:\n- Top becomes plus-sign crosses: 1, 4 (propagated from bottom), 2, 3, 6\n- Bottom becomes X-shaped crosses: 6, 2, 1, 3, 4 (permuted from top + existing 4)\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,1,0,1,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,6,0,6,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8,8,8,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,8,5,8,5,8,8,5,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,6,0,6,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0\n0,6,0,6,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

Each slot can host either a top diamond (rows 2\u20134) or a bottom X (rows 21\u201323).\n\n#### Color reordering for the newly created X-shapes\nTake the colors of the solid blocks in reading order along the line of blocks (here left\u2192right).  \nReorder them as:\n\n- **even-indexed colors** (2nd, 4th, \u2026), **reversed**\n- then **odd-indexed colors** (1st, 3rd, \u2026) in original order\n\nPlace these reordered colors as **X-shapes** into the **empty bottom slots** from left to right (skipping any slot already occupied by an existing X-shape).\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n- Top solid blocks (left\u2192right): **[1, 2, 3, 6]**\n- Bottom already has an X-shape of **4** (so that slot is occupied).\n- One top slot is empty \u2192 fill it with a **diamond of color 4**.\n\nPermutation of block colors:\n- evens = [2, 6] \u2192 reversed = [6, 2]\n- odds  = [1, 3]\n- result = **[6, 2, 1, 3]**\n\nPlace these as bottom X-shapes into the remaining empty bottom slots (left\u2192right).\n\nAll other cells stay unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,1,0,1,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,6,0,6,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8,8,8,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,8,5,8,5,8,8,5,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,6,0,6,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0\n0,6,0,6,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

A **row of isolated 8s** just below the top blocks marks the **ports/slots** (their center columns).\n\n---\n\n### 1) Convert each 3\u00d73 solid block into a \u201cdiamond\u201d\nA solid 3\u00d73 block of color `c` becomes this 3\u00d73 pattern (centered at the same place):\n\n- keep only the midpoints of each side:\n  - top middle, left middle, right middle, bottom middle\n- clear everything else in that 3\u00d73 (corners and center become 0)\n\nSo a 3\u00d73 becomes a 4-pixel diamond:  \nrows = `c` at (top middle), `c` at (middle left & middle right), `c` at (bottom middle).\n\n---\n\n### 2) Identify the port columns\nThe row of isolated 8s is row 4 in the test input; those 8s occur at columns:\n\n- **2, 7, 12, 17, 22**\n\nThese are the centers of the top diamonds and the bottom X-markers.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Trace the wiring permutation (which input port feeds which output port)\nFor each port (row4, col = one of the above), follow the connected non\u2011zero \u201cwire\u201d cells downward through the diagram until it ends at the bottom port row (row19). This gives a mapping **start_column \u2192 end_column**.\n\nDoing that tracing yields:\n\n- **2 \u2192 12**\n- **7 \u2192 22**\n- **12 \u2192 17**\n- **17 \u2192 7**\n- **22 \u2192 2**\n\nSo colors move along those connections to form the output row of X-markers.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Fill any missing top port color using any given bottom X-marker\nThe test input already contains a bottom X-marker of **color 4** centered at **col 22**.  \nFrom the mapping, output col22 comes from input col7, so:\n\n- **input color at port 7 must be 4**\n\nThus the top port colors (left\u2192right) are:\n\n- col2=1, col7=4, col12=2, col17=3, col22=6\n\nWe draw diamonds for *all* ports, including the one that was missing a solid block.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Draw bottom X-markers for all ports using the mapping\nSend each input color to its mapped output port and draw a 3-row X-marker (2-1-2 shape) in rows **20\u201322**.\n\nResulting bottom output colors at centers:\n\n- end col2 = 6\n- end col7 = 3\n- end col12 = 1\n- end col17 = 2\n- end col22 = 4\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,1,0,1,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,6,0,6,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8,8,8,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,8,5,8,5,8,8,5,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,6,0,6,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0\n0,6,0,6,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",
