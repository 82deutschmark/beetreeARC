        "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into a Complex Pattern Recognition Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I need to transform inputs based on a few provided examples. My immediate thought is to dissect these examples and identify the underlying rules. It's clear that the output is always a 20x20 grid, but the inputs vary in size, which suggests some kind of tiling or resizing operation.\n\nMy initial analysis involves breaking down the structure of each example.  I'm looking for relationships between input size and output size, the colors used, and any discernible patterns in how the input data is mapped to the output. Example 1 has me thinking about a basic pasting of the input in the top left corner. However, this is quickly disrupted as Example 4 shows a displacement.\n\nA crucial observation emerges: the *location* of the input within the output is not fixed. Sometimes it's in the top-left, sometimes not. This hints at a more dynamic transformation, possibly related to some periodic or repeating structure. I start to entertain the possibility of an infinite grid or a torus where the input is merely a window.\n\nThe \"Examples\" are leading me down a rabbit hole.  I now have the task of deriving how the input pattern relates to the output pattern. I need to extrapolate. The Test Input is 11x10. I hypothesize that this Test Input fits in the center.\n\nBased on an observation from example 4, I assume the \"test input\" window fits at the center. I hypothesize this \"Test Input\" window is a crop or section of a grid, then tile it.\n\nSo I am now testing this hypothesis, and based on the nature of the test input. I now tile the input with a 2x2.\n\nThis should generate the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a test input grid into an output grid based on five solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Output Size:** In all five examples, the output grid size is consistently **20x20**, regardless of the input size (which varies: 8x10, 16x8, 10x10, 13x12, 8x10).\n2.  **Pattern Relationship:** The input grid acts as a \"seed\" or a \"window\" into a larger repeating pattern that fills the 20x20 output grid.\n    *   In **Example 1** (Input 8x10), the input matches the top-left corner of the output.\n    *   In **Example 3** (Input 10x10), the input matches the top-left corner.\n    *   In **Example 4** (Input 13x12), the input is found starting at row 2, column 0 of the output.\n    *   In **Example 5** (Input 8x10), the input is found at the bottom-right of the output (starting at row 12, column 10).\n3.  **Tiling Logic:** The most consistent transformation that explains the generation of the full 20x20 grid from a smaller rectangular input is **periodic tiling** (repeating the input grid).\n    *   Mathematically, this corresponds to mapping the output pixel at coordinate $(r, c)$ to the input pixel at $(r \\pmod H, c \\pmod W)$, where $H$ and $W$ are the height and width of the input grid.\n    *   Checking **Example 5**: Input 8x10. The input is at the bottom right. The pattern wraps around. For instance, Output row 0 matches Input row 4 ($0 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$? No, $12 \\pmod 8 = 4$. If Input starts at 12, then $y_{out}=12 \\to y_{in}=0$. So $y_{in} = (y_{out} - 12) \\pmod 8$. If we assume the underlying pattern is aligned such that $(0,0)$ of the pattern is $(0,0)$ of the input, then $O[r,c] = I[r \\pmod 8, c \\pmod{10}]$. Let's check Ex 5 Output(0,0). $I[0,0] = 8$. Output(0,0) is 8. Matches. This simple tiling works for Ex 5.\n    *   Checking **Example 1**: Input 8x10. $O[0,10]$ should be $I[0,0]=7$. Actual is 8. While there are some discrepancies/variations in Example 1, the other examples (especially 4 and 5) strongly suggest a tiling or sliding window mechanism. Given the Test Input has a strong diagonal texture (stripes of 5s and 6s), preserving this texture via tiling is the most logical deduction.\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\nThe output is a 20x20 grid generated by tiling the input grid.\n$Output[r, c] = Input[r \\pmod {Height}, c \\pmod {Width}]$\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   Input Size: 11 rows, 10 columns.\n*   Output Size: 20 rows, 20 columns.\n*   We will fill the output grid by copying the input grid.\n    *   Rows 0-10: Copy Input Rows 0-10.\n    *   Rows 11-19: Copy Input Rows 0-8 ($r \\pmod{11}$).\n    *   Cols 0-9: Copy Input Cols 0-9.\n    *   Cols 10-19: Copy Input Cols 0-9 ($c \\pmod{10}$).\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\nThe Input is:\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6\n```\n\nWe extend this to 20x20.\nRows 0-10, Cols 0-9: Identical to Input.\nRows 0-10, Cols 10-19: Identical to Input (since width is 10, col 10 maps to col 0).\nRows 11-19: Repeat rows starting from 0.\nRow 11 = Input Row 0\nRow 12 = Input Row 1\n...\nRow 19 = Input Row 8\n\nOutput Grid:\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Inference of a Pattern Transformation for ARC Tasks**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to crack an ARC puzzle with a bunch of examples. My thinking is to find a function that takes an input grid and spits out the corresponding output grid. Since the output's always $20 \\times 20$, I'm guessing the input is somehow being fitted or transformed into that size. \n\nFirst, I looked at scaling. Nope. Didn't fit. I tried to figure out if it was just copying parts of the input to the output, but there were shifts and weird overlaps. My first observation, the inputs are a variety of shapes and sizes while all outputs are $20 \\times 20$. The examples I am shown vary in dimension, making a simple scaling transformation impossible. I also thought, what if the inputs are simply \"cropped\" out of the larger $20 \\times 20$ picture. That failed because I can't find an obvious $20 \\times 20$ repeated shape within the examples. Then I thought rotation! Maybe rotating the input and putting it in quadrants. But again, that didn't pan out since the size of the inputs are all different.\n\nI kept looking for the secret sauce! I'm noticing a pattern: the outputs are tiled versions of the inputs. But, it's not a simple tiling. The outputs' horizontal dimensions are always double the inputs'. It must be \"smart-tiling.\"\n\nThen, a key realization: the outputs are composed of the input, possibly with transformations and shifts! Think about it, the outputs have repeating features. I started to think of them as wallpapers. I realized that the best bet is to try to expand the smaller inputs into a $20 \\times 20$ tiled shape. Let's make an algorithm! The key is to see that we can \"fill-in\" the output space. The core idea is to replicate it horizontally (shift the data) and then vertically mirror it. This approach allows me to tile the $20\\times20$ canvas from a base shape. The user is probably trying to test how well the algorithm \"extends\" the pattern. If there's a pattern, I can extend it with mirror and shift. If no pattern, that's what the task is all about!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a test input grid of size $11 \\times 10$ into an output grid. Based on the solved examples, we can observe the following patterns:\n1.  **Output Dimensions:** All output grids in the examples are $20 \\times 20$, regardless of the input size.\n2.  **Horizontal Pattern:** The output width (20) is exactly twice the input width (10) for the relevant examples (Example 1, 3, 5, Test). In Example 1, the right half of the output (columns 10-19) is a cyclic shift of the left half (columns 0-9) by 5 positions (half the width). This creates a symmetric or continuous appearance at the boundary. For the test input, which consists of distinct blocks of colors 5 and 6, this shift strategy will align matching colors at the center seam (e.g., `...5,5` | `5,5...`).\n3.  **Vertical Pattern:** The output height is 20. The input heights vary. In Example 1 ($H=8$), the rows below the input region are reflections of the rows above (Row 8 is a copy of Row 7). This suggests a mirroring or \"bouncing\" pattern to fill the vertical space. Since the test input has height 11, we will fill rows 0-10 with the generated horizontal pattern, and then fill rows 11-19 by reflecting the rows 10 down to 2.\n\n**Transformation Rules Applied:**\n1.  **Top Half (Rows 0-10):**\n    *   **Left (Cols 0-9):** Copy the Input row directly.\n    *   **Right (Cols 10-19):** Apply a cyclic shift of 5 to the Input row.\n2.  **Bottom Half (Rows 11-19):**\n    *   Mirror the rows from the top half. Row $y$ (where $y > 10$) is a copy of Row $10 - (y - 11)$.\n    *   Specifically: Row 11 is a copy of Row 10, Row 12 is a copy of Row 9, ..., Row 19 is a copy of Row 2.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n\n*   **Row 0:**\n    *   Input: `6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5`\n    *   Shift 5: `5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6`\n    *   Output: `6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6`\n*   **Row 1:**\n    *   Input: `5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6`\n    *   Shift 5: `5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5`\n    *   Output: `5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5`\n*   **Row 2:**\n    *   Input: `6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6`\n    *   Shift 5: `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6`\n    *   Output: `6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6`\n*   **Row 3:**\n    *   Input: `5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6`\n    *   Shift 5: `6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6`\n    *   Output: `5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6`\n*   **Row 4:**\n    *   Input: `5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6`\n    *   Shift 5: `6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6`\n    *   Output: `5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6`\n*   **Row 5:**\n    *   Input: `6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6`\n    *   Shift 5: `6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6`\n    *   Output: `6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6`\n*   **Row 6:**\n    *   Input: `5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6`\n    *   Shift 5: `6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5`\n    *   Output: `5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5`\n*   **Row 7:**\n    *   Input: `5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6`\n    *   Shift 5: `5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5`\n    *   Output: `5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5`\n*   **Row 8:**\n    *   Input: `5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6`\n    *   Shift 5: `5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5`\n    *   Output: `5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5`\n*   **Row 9:**\n    *   Input: `5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6`\n    *   Shift 5: `5,5,5,6,6,5,6,6,6,6`\n    *   Output: `5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,6,6,6,6`\n*   **Row 10:**\n    *   Input: `5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6`\n    *   Shift 5: `6,5,5,5,6,5,6,6,6,6`\n    *   Output: `5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,5,6,6,6,6`\n\n*   **Rows 11-19 (Mirror):**\n    *   Row 11 = Row 10\n    *   Row 12 = Row 9\n    *   ...\n    *   Row 19 = Row 2\n\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,5,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,6\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Output size**: All outputs are 20\u00d720 grids regardless of input size.\n\n2. **Input placement**: The original input is placed in the top-left corner of the output.\n\n3. **Pattern continuation**: The examples show snake/ribbon patterns (made of one color against a background) that form open paths in the input. The transformation extends these patterns to create closed loops in the 20\u00d720 output.\n\n4. **Snake behavior**: Looking at the examples:\n   - The snake continues from its endpoints\n   - It creates diagonal, horizontal, and vertical bands\n   - The continuation follows the same \"style\" as the original\n   - Eventually, the extensions connect to form a complete circuit\n\nFor the test input:\n- The 5s form a snake starting at top-right (row 0, cols 5-9)\n- It meanders through the grid with a diagonal pattern going from top-right toward bottom-left\n- It ends with a vertical line at column 0 (rows 7-10) and a diagonal band at the bottom (cols 6-8 at row 10)\n\nThe transformation should:\n1. Keep the original in rows 0-10, cols 0-9\n2. Continue the diagonal pattern going down-right from the bottom of the input\n3. Continue the vertical patterns\n4. Add connecting patterns on the right side\n5. Create patterns that loop back to connect all endpoints\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5\n6,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,5\n5,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,6,6,5,5\n5,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n```",
