        "Full raw LLM response": "**My initial assessment is that the user wants me to solve an ARC task, likely involving transforming grid-based input into a specific output format. The problem seems to revolve around re-arranging blocks of pixels, where block placement and order are based on analyzing and interpreting the given examples.**\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the given examples, my initial thoughts were that the solution would involve identifying the structural pattern of the given examples. \n\n**Example 1:**\nI recognized the 11x11 input grid. It's a square grid that seems to be separated into four quadrants by horizontal and vertical lines of 6s. The output grid is wider, but the key is that it's a vertical stacking of these four quadrants. I counted the pixel colors to be a key factor in how the output was structured. The outputs for each quadrant were: red(2)=4, green(3)=6, yellow(4)=7, and blue(1)=10. So it appears that there is an order, but what is it? I compared these numbers, and noticed an increasing order. The corresponding order of appearance in the output grid was as well the corresponding order of pixel counts - a crucial finding. This suggested an ascending order in the pixel count within the quadrant.\n\n**Example 2:**\nI then analyzed the second example and realized that there's a 17x5 tall input, composed of horizontal bands, and converted into a 5x17 wide output. There are three regions separated by lines of 6s, and the corresponding pixel count was all at 7. Because the counts were all the same, the method for determining output order was less clear. By looking at the pattern, it seems as though it had to do with order of appearance from bottom to top, or it could also be the value of the color itself. I initially considered these various possibilities, until I noticed that there was an opposite order being followed.\n\n**Example 3:**\nI next reviewed the third example, which was a 5x17 wide input transformed into a 17x5 vertical stack, again separated by 6s. By doing this I had confirmed my suspicions of how the re-arrangement works. Since it was in the descending order of the count, this helped me confirm my suspicions.\n\nThrough these analyses, I've concluded the most important steps to solving this problem will be as follows:\n1.  **Grid Parsing:**\n    *   Parse the input grid into 5x5 blocks separated by the value 6.\n\n2.  **Pixel Counting:**\n    *   For each block, calculate the total number of pixels that do not have the background color (7).\n\n3.  **Output Layout and Sorting**\n    *   **Square input:** If the input is Square, I can use an ascending pixel count (as in Example 1).\n    *   **Tall vs Wide input:** If there are ties for the pixel counts, it must rely on reverse order.\n\nNow, with this information, I can analyze the test input and derive the solution.\n\nBy comparing this test input to the examples, I see that the Test Input is also a 11x11 square grid with separators. Therefore, I can use a similar approach as was used to solve Example 1. I'll split the input into four quadrants and calculate the non-7 pixel count in each.\n\nMy final thought is that, based on all three examples, the key to solving this is going to be correctly calculating pixel count to determine the order of the blocks, and then use the previous analysis to construct the solution.\n\n\nThe task is to transform a grid of colored pixels separated by lines of color 6 (magenta). By analyzing the solved examples, we can deduce the following rules:\n\n1.  **Grid Parsing**: The input grid is divided into subgrids (blocks) by horizontal and/or vertical lines of 6s.\n    *   Example 1 and the Test Input are 11x11 grids divided into four 5x5 quadrants by a central cross of 6s.\n    *   Example 2 is a 17x5 grid divided into three 5x5 blocks vertically.\n    *   Example 3 is a 5x17 grid divided into three 5x5 blocks horizontally.\n\n2.  **Output Structure**: The subgrids are rearranged and concatenated.\n    *   If the input is square (11x11), the output is a vertical stack of the 5x5 blocks, separated by horizontal lines of 6s (Resulting size: 23x5).\n\n3.  **Sorting Logic**: The order of the stacked blocks is determined by the **count of non-background (non-7) pixels** in each block.\n    *   **Example 1 (Square Input)**: The blocks are stacked in **Ascending** order of their pixel counts.\n        *   Top-Left (Red): 4 pixels -> Position 1\n        *   Bottom-Right (Green): 6 pixels -> Position 2\n        *   Top-Right (Yellow): 7 pixels -> Position 3\n        *   Bottom-Left (Blue): 10 pixels -> Position 4\n    *   **Example 2 (Tall Input)**: The blocks have equal pixel counts (7). The output order is Bottom, Middle, Top. This implies that for ties, the order is **Reverse Input Order** (or Descending Index).\n\n**Application to Test Input**:\n\n1.  **Parse Quadrants**:\n    *   **Top-Left (TL)**: Contains Yellow (4) pixels.\n    *   **Top-Right (TR)**: Contains Yellow (4) pixels.\n    *   **Bottom-Left (BL)**: Contains Yellow (4) pixels.\n    *   **Bottom-Right (BR)**: Contains Yellow (4) pixels.\n\n2.  **Count Pixels**:\n    *   **TL**:\n        Row 1: 3 (`7,4,4,4,7`)\n        Row 2: 3 (`4,4,7,4,7`)\n        Row 3: 3 (`7,4,4,4,7`)\n        Total: **9**\n    *   **TR**:\n        Row 1: 4 (`4,4,4,4,7`)\n        Row 2: 2 (`7,7,7,4,4`)\n        Row 3: 3 (`7,4,4,4,7`)\n        Total: **9**\n    *   **BL**:\n        Row 1: 3 (`7,4,4,4,7`)\n        Row 2: 2 (`7,4,7,4,7`)\n        Row 3: 3 (`7,4,7,4,4`)\n        Total: **8**\n    *   **BR**:\n        Row 1: 3 (`7,4,7,4,4`)\n        Row 2: 2 (`7,4,7,4,7`)\n        Row 3: 4 (`4,4,4,4,7`)\n        Total: **9**\n\n3.  **Sort**:\n    *   Primary Key: Count Ascending.\n    *   Secondary Key (Tie-breaker): Reverse Input Order (BR -> TR -> TL).\n    *   **First**: BL (Count 8).\n    *   **Tied (Count 9)**: BR, TR, TL (in reverse reading order).\n    *   **Final Order**: BL, BR, TR, TL.\n\n4.  **Construct Output**:\n    *   Block 1: BL\n    *   Separator: 6s\n    *   Block 2: BR\n    *   Separator: 6s\n    *   Block 3: TR\n    *   Separator: 6s\n    *   Block 4: TL\n\n7,7,7,7,7\n7,4,4,4,7\n7,4,7,4,7\n7,4,7,4,4\n7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7\n7,4,7,4,4\n7,4,7,4,7\n4,4,4,4,7\n7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7\n4,4,4,4,7\n7,7,7,4,4\n7,4,4,4,7\n7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7\n7,4,4,4,7\n4,4,7,4,7\n7,4,4,4,7\n7,7,7,7,7",

The order is: TL, BR, TR, BL (main diagonal first, then anti-diagonal).\n\n2. **Example 2**: A 5\u00d717 grid with 3 sections stacked vertically becomes a 17\u00d75 grid with sections arranged horizontally.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, let's break down this ARC task!** I'm looking at how a grid is reshaped based on some examples. It seems like the input is split into subgrids, and the output is a rearrangement of those subgrids.\n\n**First**, I analyzed Example 1, a 2x2 grid transformed into a vertical stack.  I noticed the output has four sections which seemed to correspond to the input's four quadrants: top-left (TL), top-right (TR), bottom-left (BL), and bottom-right (BR).  The trick was identifying the **order**. I found that the sub-grids were sorted by the number of non-background (color 7) pixels in the shapes. It was an **ascending** sort, going from the least to the most colored pixels, and used reading order to break any ties between equal pixel counts. This gave me the order for Example 1 as  TL, BR, TR, BL.\n\n**Next**, Example 2 showed a vertical stack of three subgrids being transformed into a horizontal arrangement.  I saw a similar pattern of rearranging sections, this time with a **descending** sort by pixel count. However, the exact order from previous was a bit unclear, and it was tempting to think this order from before may be incorrect. I had to look at this one closer. The input and output were reversed, which made me think this might be a simple reverse operation. I then decided that this was simply about transposing the sub-grids.\n\n**Example 3**, with a horizontal input and vertical output, further solidified my understanding. The sort was also **descending**, confirming the pattern I saw with Example 2.\n\n**Thinking carefully now,** it clicked: the *structure* of the input\u2014how the subgrids are stacked\u2014dictates whether we **reverse** or **preserve** the sort order. Input as a vertical stack = Reverse order. Input as a horizontal stack = Preserving. For a 2x2 input grid, I decided to treat the 2x2 grid as a \"vertical\" stacking.\n\n**Moving to the test input,** it's a 2x2 grid. Following my hypothesis, the transformation should involve sorting the subgrids. I extracted the quadrants, counted the non-background pixels, and found that the counts were (TL, TR, BL, BR) as 9, 9, 8, 9, respectively. Applying the rule for the 2x2 to sort the subgrids, I applied an **ascending** sort. So the grid is now sorted by the number of non-background (color 7) pixels. If two or more have the same pixel count, then break with the standard reading order from the input.\n\n**Finally, I'm confident** that I understand the core of this transformation.\n\n*   Parse the input and extract the 4 (or 3) subgrids.\n*   Count the non-background pixels in each subgrid.\n*   Sort in ascending order (or reverse, depending on structure).\n*   Create the output with the sorted subgrids.\n*   Use reading order to break ties in pixel counts.\n\nI just need to construct the output grid using the correct ordering and separators and I should have the correct answer!\n\n\nThe transformation logic is inferred as follows:\n\n1.  **Grid Parsing**: The input grid (11x11) is divided into four 5x5 sub-grids by a vertical line at column index 5 and a horizontal line at row index 5. Both separator lines are color 6 (magenta). This creates four quadrants: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n\n2.  **Feature Extraction**: For each of the four 5x5 sub-grids, we count the number of pixels that are *not* the background color (7). The background color 7 is identified as the dominant color surrounding the shapes.\n    *   **Test Input Analysis**:\n        *   **Top-Left (TL)**: Contains a shape of color 4.\n            *   Row 1: `7,4,4,4,7` (3 pixels)\n            *   Row 2: `4,4,7,4,7` (3 pixels)\n            *   Row 3: `7,4,4,4,7` (3 pixels)\n            *   Total: 9 pixels.\n        *   **Top-Right (TR)**: Contains a shape of color 4.\n            *   Row 1: `4,4,4,4,7` (4 pixels)\n            *   Row 2: `7,7,7,4,4` (2 pixels)\n            *   Row 3: `7,4,4,4,7` (3 pixels)\n            *   Total: 9 pixels.\n        *   **Bottom-Left (BL)**: Contains a shape of color 4.\n            *   Row 7: `7,4,4,4,7` (3 pixels)\n            *   Row 8: `7,4,7,4,7` (2 pixels)\n            *   Row 9: `7,4,7,4,4` (3 pixels)\n            *   Total: 8 pixels.\n        *   **Bottom-Right (BR)**: Contains a shape of color 4.\n            *   Row 7: `7,4,7,4,4` (3 pixels)\n            *   Row 8: `7,4,7,4,7` (2 pixels)\n            *   Row 9: `4,4,4,4,7` (4 pixels)\n            *   Total: 9 pixels.\n\n3.  **Sorting Logic**: Based on Example 1, the sub-grids are rearranged into a vertical stack sorted by their pixel count in **ascending order**.\n    *   Example 1 had counts 4, 7, 8, 10 and was output in that order.\n    *   For the Test Input, the counts are 8, 9, 9, 9.\n    *   The sorted order starts with the sub-grid having count 8 (**BL**).\n    *   The remaining three sub-grids have a count of 9. Following standard conventions for stable sorting (preserving reading order TL, TR, BR), the order for the ties is **TL**, then **TR**, then **BR**.\n    *   Final Order: **BL, TL, TR, BR**.\n\n4.  **Output Construction**: The output is a vertical stack of these 5x5 grids, separated by single rows of color 6. The output dimensions are 23 rows by 5 columns.\n\n    *   **Section 1**: BL grid.\n    *   **Separator**: Row of 6s.\n    *   **Section 2**: TL grid.\n    *   **Separator**: Row of 6s.\n    *   **Section 3**: TR grid.\n    *   **Separator**: Row of 6s.\n    *   **Section 4**: BR grid.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\n7,7,7,7,7\n7,4,4,4,7\n7,4,7,4,7\n7,4,7,4,4\n7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7\n7,4,4,4,7\n4,4,7,4,7\n7,4,4,4,7\n7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7\n4,4,4,4,7\n7,7,7,4,4\n7,4,4,4,7\n7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7\n7,4,7,4,4\n7,4,7,4,7\n4,4,4,4,7\n7,7,7,7,7",
