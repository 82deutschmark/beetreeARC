        "Full raw LLM response": "**Comprehensive Analysis and Solution for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to solve an ARC task, and it seems like it's a logic puzzle involving circuit simulation. The input is a grid of numbers representing \"colors\" or states, and the output is a modified version of the same grid. I need to figure out the transformation rules based on the examples.\n\nInitially, I see the grid is a \"canvas\" with blocks and wire-like structures, with the goal to simulate a circuit.  The key is that the initial and final states of the circuit are based on the initial state, and it seems like there are several key elements: input terminals (blocks), logic gates made from 9s, wires (made from 8s), and output terminals (blocks).\n\nFirst off, I notice that there are three examples. Example 1 has the core elements (blocks of 3s, 2s, and 6s) and wiring. It shows the connection between 3x3 blocks and \"wires\", and the change that occurs in the output. I also noticed there are different block patterns: Solid, Diamond and Checkerboard. Analyzing the patterns in Example 1, I deduce that the \"blocks\" have 3 different states:\n1.  Solid blocks: Usually input state.\n2.  Diamond blocks: Low or OFF.\n3.  Checkerboard blocks: High or ON.\n\nThis analysis provides the insight that the solid blocks transform to diamond blocks and Checkerboard blocks remain the same. The wiring and gates are made of 8s, 9s, 4s, and 5s and the transformation is affected by the connection, gates and states.\n\nI examine the 9s block and see how wires connect into it, and conclude it might be a NOT gate or a buffer gate. Wires and gates seem to be the logic structure of the puzzle. I also recognize that the 5s blocks can act as AND or OR structures. After several attempts at simulating circuit behavior, I realize that it can be simplified as a set of rules for block changes:\n1.  Solid Input blocks at the top -> Diamond block.\n2.  Newly generated blocks are Checkerboard.\n3. Wires and gates remain same.\n4.  Copy rest of the grid without change.\nApplying these rules, I successfully decipher Example 1.\n\nMoving on, Example 2 has input and output. The task is to deduce the behavior of inputs with wire connections.  Input is changed to a Diamond pattern which might suggest that signal is being \"consumed\" or is the base \"0\" from which logic builds. \n\nI make an important distinction: \"Inputs\" at the start of a wire will turn into Diamonds in the Output, while outputs are created. Also, these blocks could be a visual indication of the signal value (Diamond=0, Checkerboard=1).\n\nI confirm in Example 3 that my rules regarding block patterns hold: input blocks turn to Diamond, new blocks are Checkerboard. At this point, I am confident I can predict the output for the test input.\n\nThe test input has 1, 2, 3, and 6 as the initial inputs which I'll transform to Diamonds. There's a 9 block and 4 block. Based on Example 1 and 3, I know new output at the end of the wire becomes Checkerboard.\n\nI will start with the input grid, clear the 3x3 block regions, draw the new patterns in these 3x3 regions, and that's the output. I can generate the new checkerboard patterns based on rows and columns and the size of the block.\n\n**To implement:**\n1.  Parse the input grid.\n2.  Clear the specific 3x3 (or 4x3) areas.\n3.  Draw the new patterns in the 3x3 areas, according to my earlier calculations on the positions.\n\nI will zero out col 1 of the bottom 9s block and make cols 2-4 Checkerboard.\nI will make col 2 of the 4s block 0 and col 3 and 4 checkerboard.\n\nEverything else stays as is.\n\nI feel confident in this approach. I have a clear set of rules and a method for translating them into a solution. I can generate the correct output grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform an input grid based on the logic inferred from three examples.\n\n**Inferred Logic:**\n1.  **System Components:** The grid represents a logic circuit.\n    *   **Wires (8):** Transport signals.\n    *   **Logic Gates (Structures of 5, 9, etc.):** Process signals.\n    *   **Terminals (3x3 Blocks):** Input and Output points for signals.\n    *   **Connection:** Terminals are connected to the circuit via wires.\n\n2.  **Terminal States:**\n    *   **Solid 3x3 Block:** Represents an **Input Source** (initially High/Active).\n    *   **Diamond 3x3 Pattern (4 pixels):** Represents an **Inactive State** (Low/Off) or a \"Spent Input\".\n        *   Pattern: Center edges are colored, corners and center are empty.\n        *   `[[0, C, 0], [C, 0, C], [0, C, 0]]`\n    *   **Checkerboard 3x3 Pattern (5 pixels):** Represents an **Active State** (High/On).\n        *   Pattern: Corners and center are colored.\n        *   `[[C, 0, C], [0, C, 0], [C, 0, C]]`\n\n3.  **Transformation Rules:**\n    *   **Inputs (Top/Start of wires):** Solid blocks in the input grid represent sources. In the output grid, they always transform into the **Diamond** pattern (indicating the input has been read/consumed).\n    *   **Outputs (Bottom/End of wires):** Blocks at the end of the logic chains reflect the signal state. Based on the examples, the circuit logic in the provided tasks results in **Active (Checkerboard)** outputs for all connected terminals.\n    *   **Existing Bottom Blocks:** Any pre-existing blocks at output positions (whether Solid or Diamond in the input) are transformed/updated to the **Checkerboard** pattern in the output.\n    *   **Wiring and Gates:** The rest of the grid (wires 8, gates 5/9, background 0) remains unchanged.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Top Input Blocks (Solid -> Diamond):**\n    *   **Blue (1) Block:** Rows 1-3, Cols 1-3. Transform to Diamond.\n    *   **Red (2) Block:** Rows 1-3, Cols 11-13. Transform to Diamond.\n    *   **Green (3) Block:** Rows 1-3, Cols 16-18. Transform to Diamond.\n    *   **Magenta (6) Block:** Rows 1-3, Cols 21-23. Transform to Diamond.\n\n2.  **Bottom Output Blocks ( -> Checkerboard):**\n    *   **Maroon (9) Block:** Located at Rows 15-17. In the input, it is a 4-wide solid block (Cols 1-4). The connecting wire is at Col 5. To maintain connectivity (adjacency to Col 5), the 3x3 block must be placed at Cols 2-4. We clear Col 1 and place a **Checkerboard** pattern of 9s in Cols 2-4.\n    *   **Yellow (4) Block:** Located at Rows 20-22, Cols 21-23. In the input, it is a Diamond pattern. Being an output, it transforms to **Checkerboard**.\n\n3.  **Background/Circuit:** Copied exactly from input.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n\n*   **Block 1 (Blue):**\n    `0,0,0,0,0...` -> `0,0,0,0,0...`\n    `0,1,1,1,0...` -> `0,0,1,0,0...`\n    `0,1,1,1,0...` -> `0,1,0,1,0...`\n    `0,1,1,1,0...` -> `0,0,1,0,0...`\n\n*   **Block 2 (Red), Block 3 (Green), Block 6 (Magenta):** Apply same Diamond pattern logic at their coordinates.\n\n*   **Block 9 (Maroon):**\n    Rows 15-17, Cols 1-4 input: `0,9,9,9,9,0...`\n    Output (Checkerboard at Cols 2-4): `0,0,9,0,9,0...`\n    (Row 16 center line: `0,0,0,9,0,8...`)\n\n*   **Block 4 (Yellow):**\n    Rows 20-22 input: Diamond.\n    Output: Checkerboard `[[4,0,4],[0,4,0],[4,0,4]]`.\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,6,0,6,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8,8,8,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,9,0,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,9,0,8,5,8,5,8,8,5,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,9,0,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, here's my thought process for this ARC task, broken down step-by-step:\n\n**1. Initial Assessment and Pattern Recognition:** I start by looking at the provided examples, focusing on the input and output grids. My goal is to identify how the input transforms into the output. I immediately notice the size consistency (22x22). I analyze the colors (3,2,6) and their positions and shapes (solid blocks, an X pattern). I start by carefully documenting the coordinates of the blocks, I then trace the evolution of each color block from input to output, noting that blocks transform from solid/X shapes into a \"Diamond\" or a \"X\".\n\n**2. Identifying Wires and Connections:**  I see a network of teal lines (8s) connecting the colored blocks. I trace these \"wires\" to understand the flow of information. I hypothesize that the teal wires are crucial for determining how colors shift around. I pay attention to the relative positions of elements and start tracking the positions of each color in both input and output.\n\n**3. \"Amida-kuji\" Hypothesis:** Inspired by the visual arrangement of wires, I consider the possibility of an \"Amida-kuji\" or permutation network. This leads me to believe the colors are being routed or swapped through a series of connections. I look at intersections and junctions in the wire structure and try to infer rules.\n\n**4. The \"5\" and \"9\" Mystery:** I observe that \"5\" and \"9\" values are present in the wire structure, and hypothesize that these may play a role in the routing, perhaps acting as switches, bridges, or blockers. I trace the connections in various examples, trying to decipher their meaning by comparing their arrangement in multiple solved examples.\n\n**5. Decoding the Test Input's Logic:** I move on to the \"Test Input\" and its grid. I apply what I've learned from solved examples to this new problem. I see the colors, their shapes, and the wire structure. I go down the wires to understand the source to destination mappings, carefully tracing.\n\n**6. Analyzing the Wire Network:** Based on the placement of the \"5\" and \"9\" markers within the wires, I start formulating rules for \"swapping\". I look at how the horizontal \"5\" blocks might cause lines to intersect or switch positions. I see that these elements create connections that are horizontal, implying potential swaps between lines. I continue tracing from sources.\n\n**7. Test the \"Swap\" Logic with the Examples:** I then test the hypothesis that the \"5\" and \"9\" markers imply swaps. I test my swap logic on previous examples to validate my understanding of the wiring's behavior. I order the wires by how they change the input, which I've found to be a useful technique when looking for permutations.\n\n**8. Mapping Sources to Destinations:** I look at the order of colors in the source grid, and trace their paths to the final output to find out the rules that govern the outputs.\n\n**9. Analyzing the Occupied Destination:** The Test Input has an occupied destination with the color Yellow. This requires me to rethink how the colors move. Based on prior observations I test out the \"empty source\" logic. I consider what happens to this fixed item, I re-analyze the problem with the assumption that the 4 is fixed.\n\n**10. Finding the Missing Source:** I consider that perhaps there is an \"empty source\". By tracing the paths and recognizing the \"routing\", I realize there is a source \"empty\" that can be used. By carefully looking at the grid I find a wire path in column 7, and infer that there is actually an empty source in row 7.\n\n**11. Ordering the Swaps:** I now have the 5 inputs and 5 output destinations. I need to arrange these. I order the inputs and study how the wiring permutes them. I observe that the wiring seems to shuffle the elements to the side.\n\n**12. Final Testing on Test Inputs:** Based on the \"Swaps\" hypothesis, I go through a meticulous line-by-line check. By tracing what would happen after different swaps, I see a clear set of steps needed to move the source colors. I simulate the movements in the test input, by looking at what changes happen in the outputs of each wire section.\n\n**13. Final Verification and Construction Plan:**  I have a plan, the \"Empty slot to the side\" logic. So, to confirm, by tracing, I look at the permutations, and confirm that the wiring \"bubbles\" a slot that has color. Now, knowing the final location of all the items, I plan the output by drawing each shape in the correct destination. I then carefully document each step to be taken.\n\n**14. Documenting the Solution:** I create the final algorithm.\n\n**15. Double-checking\n\nThe problem asks us to simulate a routing system where colored blocks travel from \"Source\" positions at the top to \"Destination\" positions at the bottom. The transformation involves two parts:\n1.  **Shape Transformation:**\n    *   Source blocks (solid 3x3 squares) are transformed into **Hollow Diamonds** (3x3) at their original location.\n    *   The blocks move to their destination slots and appear as **Xs** (3x3).\n2.  **Routing/Permutation:**\n    *   The wires (color 8) and components (colors 5 and 9) determine the mapping from source columns to destination columns.\n    *   We analyzed the test input's wiring logic, specifically interpreting the horizontal bars as mechanisms that reverse or swap the order of the connected paths.\n    *   **Sources:**\n        *   Blue (1) at Column 2 (Pos 1).\n        *   Empty at Column 7 (Pos 2).\n        *   Red (2) at Column 12 (Pos 3).\n        *   Green (3) at Column 17 (Pos 4).\n        *   Magenta (6) at Column 22 (Pos 5).\n    *   **Logic:** The routing reverses the first three lines (Pos 1, 2, 3) effectively swapping Blue and Red and moving the Empty slot. The Empty slot then \"bubbles\" to the end (Pos 5), shifting the remaining blocks left.\n    *   **Mapping:**\n        *   Pos 1 (Blue) $\\to$ Pos 2 (Dest Slot 2).\n        *   Pos 3 (Red) $\\to$ Pos 1 (Dest Slot 1).\n        *   Pos 4 (Green) $\\to$ Pos 3 (Dest Slot 3).\n        *   Pos 5 (Magenta) $\\to$ Pos 4 (Dest Slot 4).\n        *   Pos 2 (Empty) $\\to$ Pos 5 (Dest Slot 5, which is already occupied by Yellow 4, consistent with \"no overwrite\").\n    *   **Final Destination Order:** Red (at Col 2), Blue (at Col 7), Green (at Col 12), Magenta (at Col 17), Yellow (Fixed at Col 22).\n\n**Output Construction:**\n*   **Rows 1-3:** Draw Diamonds for Blue (Col 2), Red (Col 12), Green (Col 17), Magenta (Col 22).\n*   **Rows 4-20:** Copy wires exactly from Input.\n*   **Rows 21-23:** Draw Xs for Red (Col 2), Blue (Col 7), Green (Col 12), Magenta (Col 17), Yellow (Col 22).\n\nOutput Grid:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,6,0,6,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8,8,8,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,8,5,8,5,8,8,5,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

The mapping follows:\n   - Each top position copies to a bottom position\n   - Each bottom position copies to a top position\n   - Left-right positions swap in the reflected row\n\nFor the test input:\n- **Top row has solid blocks**: 1 (cols 1-3), 2 (cols 11-13), 3 (cols 16-18), 6 (cols 21-23)\n- **Bottom row has diamond**: 4 (cols 21-23)\n\nApplying the transformation:\n- Convert all solid blocks to diamonds\n- Add 4's diamond to top position 2 (cols 6-8)\n- Add reflected copies to bottom: 6 at cols 1-3, 3 at cols 6-8, 2 at cols 11-13, 1 at cols 16-18\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,1,0,1,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,6,0,6,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8,8,8,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,8,5,8,5,8,8,5,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,6,0,6,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### 1) What changes happen to the 3\u00d73 \u201cdata blocks\u201d\nFrom the examples there are two special 3\u00d73 patterns that matter:\n\n**A. Solid 3\u00d73 square (9 pixels, all the same color c)**  \nIt is **split into two complementary 3\u00d73 patterns**:\n- At the original location, it becomes a **hollow \u201c+\u201d without the center** (4 pixels):  \n  positions = (top-middle, middle-left, middle-right, bottom-middle).\n- Elsewhere, we create the **\u201cX\u201d pattern** (5 pixels):  \n  positions = (4 corners + center).\n\nSo a solid square turns into **(plus at the source slot) + (X at some destination slot)**.\n\n**B. 3\u00d73 \u201cX\u201d pattern already present (5 pixels of color c)**  \nIt stays as an **X** where it is, and we also create its complementary **hollow plus** (4 pixels) in some top slot.\n\nThis is why (as in example 3) a color that appears as an X in the input also appears as a hollow plus in the output.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Where do the moved pieces go? (the permutation)\nThe grid contains a large multicolored \u201cmachine\u201d made mostly of 8/9/5.  \nJust below the top squares there is a row of **8 markers**; their columns define the **centers of equally spaced 3\u00d73 slots** (top slots).  \nLikewise, just above the bottom output area there is another row of the same markers defining the **bottom slots**.\n\nBetween these two marker rows, the machine acts like a **ladder-permutation**:\n\n- Let the marker columns (slot centers) be ordered left\u2192right as slot indices 0..n\u22121.\n- Scan the machine rows from top to bottom.\n- For each row, whenever **all cells between two adjacent marker columns are non-zero**, that row contains a \u201crung\u201d connecting those two lanes, so we **swap** the two lane labels.\n- If multiple adjacent swaps occur in the same row, apply them **left to right**.\n\nAfter processing all rows, we know which **top slot index** arrives at each **bottom slot index** (a permutation).\n\nThen:\n- Each **top solid square\u2019s X-part** is placed into its destination bottom slot.\n- Each **existing bottom X\u2019s plus-part** is placed into the corresponding top slot via the inverse mapping.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Apply to the test input\n\n**Slot centers** are given by row 4 (and rows 18\u201319): columns  \n`2, 7, 12, 17, 22` \u2192 5 slots (indices 0..4).  \nTop 3\u00d73 slots are rows 1\u20133; bottom 3\u00d73 slots are rows 20\u201322.\n\n**Input data:**\n- Solid squares at top:\n  - slot0 color 1 (cols 1\u20133)\n  - slot2 color 2 (cols 11\u201313)\n  - slot3 color 3 (cols 16\u201318)\n  - slot4 color 6 (cols 21\u201323)\n- Existing bottom X:\n  - slot4 color 4 (rows 20\u201322, cols 21\u201323)\n\n**Compute ladder swaps (rows where adjacent slots are fully connected by non-zeros):**\n- row7: swaps (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)\n- row9: swaps (0,1), (1,2)\n- row12: swaps (1,2), (2,3)\n- row16: swaps (0,1), (1,2), (2,3)\n\nApplying these swaps left\u2192right gives final bottom labels:\n`[0,4,3,2,1]`  \nMeaning bottom slot 0 gets top slot 0, bottom slot 1 gets top slot 4, \u2026 bottom slot 4 gets top slot 1.  \nEquivalently (top\u2192bottom):  \n`0\u21920, 1\u21924, 2\u21923, 3\u21922, 4\u21921`.\n\nSo:\n- Place X(1) in bottom slot0\n- Place X(6) in bottom slot1\n- Place X(3) in bottom slot2\n- Place X(2) in bottom slot3\n- Keep existing X(4) in bottom slot4\n- And place the complementary **plus(4)** into top slot1 (since top slot1 \u2192 bottom slot4).\n\nAlso convert each top solid square into its hollow plus in place.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,1,0,1,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,6,0,6,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8,8,8,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,8,5,8,5,8,8,5,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,1,0,1,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0\n0,1,0,1,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What changes and why\n\nThere are two kinds of \u201cterminals\u201d in these grids:\n\n1. **Filled 3\u00d73 squares** near the top (a color repeated in a solid 3\u00d73 block).  \n2. **3\u00d73 X-shapes** near the bottom (diagonals + center):  \n   ```\n   c 0 c\n   0 c 0\n   c 0 c\n   ```\n\nBetween them is a \u201cwiring ladder\u201d made of non\u2011background cells (mostly `8`, plus `9`/`5` in places). This ladder implements a **permutation of the vertical channels**.\n\n#### Terminal conversions\n- Every **filled 3\u00d73 square** is converted in-place into a **hollow diamond** (a \u201c+\u201d without the center):\n  ```\n  0 c 0\n  c 0 c\n  0 c 0\n  ```\n- Every **bottom X terminal** stays as-is.\n- Additionally, each terminal\u2019s color is sent through the ladder to the opposite side:\n  - From a **top square color** \u2192 draw a **bottom X** at its connected bottom channel.\n  - From a **bottom X color** \u2192 draw a **top hollow diamond** at its connected top channel.\n\n#### How to read the ladder permutation\n- The **channel columns** are the columns containing `8` in the first wiring row under the top terminals.  \n  In the test, row 4 has `8` at columns: **2, 7, 12, 17, 22** \u2192 5 channels.\n- A row creates a **swap between adjacent channels** if **all cells between their two channel columns (inclusive) are non\u2011zero**.  \n  Process rows from top to bottom; if multiple swaps happen in one row, apply them **left-to-right**.\n\nFor the test grid, swaps occur at:\n- Row 7: swap (2\u20133), (3\u20134), (4\u20135)\n- Row 9: swap (1\u20132), (2\u20133)\n- Row 12: swap (2\u20133), (3\u20134)\n- Row 16: swap (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134)\n\nStarting with labels `[1,2,3,4,5]`, this yields bottom order:\n`[1,5,4,3,2]`, i.e.\n- top1 \u2192 bottom1\n- top2 \u2192 bottom5\n- top3 \u2192 bottom4\n- top4 \u2192 bottom3\n- top5 \u2192 bottom2\n\nSo the existing bottom X (color `4`) on channel 5 maps back to **top channel 2**, which is the missing top slot; and the top square colors map to bottom channels as:\n- color1 (top ch1) \u2192 bottom ch1\n- color2 (top ch3) \u2192 bottom ch4\n- color3 (top ch4) \u2192 bottom ch3\n- color6 (top ch5) \u2192 bottom ch2\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,1,0,1,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,6,0,6,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,5,8,5,8,8,8,8,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0,5,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,8,5,8,5,8,8,5,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,9,9,9,9,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,1,0,1,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0\n0,1,0,1,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,4,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",
