            "Full raw LLM response": "**1. Initial Assessment and Pattern Identification**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at an ARC task, likely involving some kind of transformation on an input grid to produce an output grid. My initial thought process involves breaking down Example 1 to identify patterns. I see that there's a background color (8), and some distinct shapes within it, each with a core color (9, 1, 4, 6) and a border of 3s. The shapes seem to be 4x4 or 4x5 blocks, and I'm noting the positions of these cores in the input relative to the grid. I'm focusing on the input grid's structure.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what each shape is doing. I can see these core colors are inside a ring of 3s, which leaves the corners of the box as 8s.\n\nI notice that the output shows those cores, but there are also what look like diagonal lines emanating from them. And also the corners of the 4x4 or 5 boxes change to the core color.\n\n**2. Refining the Transformation Rule**\n\nAlright, it looks like there's a specific set of rules.\n\nIt appears the process is:\n\n**A. Identify the object:** It's a structure with a 2x2 core of color C, surrounded by a border of 3s. There are missing corners.\n**B. Fill the corners:** Take the corners of the shape, which are usually 8s, and fill them with the core color.\n**C. Emit the beam:** The next step is diagonal projections from the filled corners.\n**D. Interact with the environment:** Diagonal lines that go out from the core's bounding box that intersect grid lines or other shapes.\n\nI start testing to see the behaviour in several shapes of the grid. It looks as though the beam interaction is important.\n\n**3. Applying to the Test Input and Handling Beams and Interactions**\n\nOkay, now let's apply these rules to a new test case. I need to find these shapes first, especially when they overlap. I'll identify the bounding box and the core within it. In my mind, I'm imagining how these lines are going to work based on the rules. I'm imagining them going out, and what will happen when they hit walls or other beams.\n\nI'm imagining where the shapes are. I'll follow the same procedure as before.\n\n**4. Generating the Final Output Grid**\n\nSo, with all the rules sorted out, I feel confident about generating the output grid. I am checking collisions again. I am imagining where all the lines are. I am noting how the lines will go, what color they will be, and where they will stop. I will generate an outline for each section and build up the output grid.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I will apply a transformation rule based on the analysis of the provided examples (1 through 4).\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The grid contains several \"core-border\" shapes. Each shape consists of a 2x2 \"core\" of a specific color $C$, surrounded by a border of color 3 (green). The corners of the shape's rectangular bounding box are initially the background color (8).\n2.  **Fill Corners:** For each identified shape, the four corners of its bounding box are filled with the shape's core color $C$.\n3.  **Emit Diagonal Beams:** From these newly filled corners, beams of color $C$ are emitted outwards into the background.\n    *   **Direction:**\n        *   Shapes in the **top half** of the grid emit beams **upwards** (Up-Left and Up-Right).\n        *   Shapes in the **bottom half** of the grid emit beams **downwards** (Down-Left and Down-Right).\n        *   Shapes in the **middle** of the grid (like the Magenta one in the test input) emit beams in **all four diagonal directions**.\n    *   **Reflection:** If a beam hits the vertical grid boundaries (left or right walls), it reflects at a 90-degree angle (like a billiard ball).\n    *   **Interaction/Termination:**\n        *   If a beam encounters another shape, it connects to it and stops.\n        *   If two beams of different colors are on a collision course to land on the same pixel (head-on collision), they stop one step early and turn vertical (or simply stop), preserving the gap between them. In Example 1, beams 9 and 1 became adjacent and turned vertical. Here, the Red (2) and Yellow (4) top beams would collide at (0,10). Following the \"adjacency/vertical\" precedence, they likely stop or deviate to (0,9) and (0,11).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shapes Identified:**\n    *   **Top-Left:** Red Core (2), bounding box rows 4-7, cols 3-6.\n    *   **Top-Right:** Yellow Core (4), bounding box rows 4-7, cols 14-17.\n    *   **Middle:** Magenta Core (6), bounding box rows 13-16, cols 22-25.\n    *   **Bottom-Left:** Maroon Core (9), bounding box rows 25-28, cols 0-3.\n    *   **Bottom-Right:** Orange Core (7), bounding box rows 20-23, cols 21-24.\n\n*   **Step 1: Fill Corners:**\n    *   Red: (4,3), (4,6), (7,3), (7,6) -> 2.\n    *   Yellow: (4,14), (4,17), (7,14), (7,17) -> 4.\n    *   Magenta: (13,22), (13,25), (16,22), (16,25) -> 6.\n    *   Orange: (20,21), (20,24), (23,21), (23,24) -> 7.\n    *   Maroon: (25,0), (25,3), (28,0), (28,3) -> 9.\n\n*   **Step 2: Project Beams:**\n\n    *   **Red (Top, Upwards):**\n        *   Left (from 4,3): Travels to (0,1) via reflection at wall (column 0).\n        *   Right (from 4,6): Travels to (0,10). **Collision Check:** Hits Yellow beam.\n    *   **Yellow (Top, Upwards):**\n        *   Left (from 4,14): Travels to (0,10). **Collision Check:** Meets Red beam.\n            *   *Resolution:* Red stops at (0,9), Yellow stops at (0,11). (Symmetric avoidance).\n        *   Right (from 4,17): Travels to (0,21).\n    *   **Magenta (Middle, All Directions):**\n        *   Up-Left (from 13,22): Travels to (8,17), hitting the bottom-right corner of the Yellow shape.\n        *   Up-Right (from 13,25): Hits wall at (9,29), reflects to (0,20). (Adjacent to Yellow beam at 21).\n        *   Down-Left (from 16,22): Travels to (29,9), passing to the left of the Orange shape.\n        *   Down-Right (from 16,25): Hits wall at (20,29), reflects to (29,20).\n    *   **Orange (Bottom, Downwards):**\n        *   Left (from 23,21): Travels to (29,15).\n        *   Right (from 23,24): Travels to (29,28), reflecting off the wall at (28,29).\n    *   **Maroon (Bottom, Downwards):**\n        *   Left (from 28,0): Travels to (29,0) (and off grid/wall).\n        *   Right (from 28,3): Travels to (29,4).\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nThe grid is constructed by superimposing these lines and filled corners onto the original background.\n\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,2,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,3,3,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,7,3,3,7,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n9,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Strategy: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, here's my game plan for tackling this ARC task. The goal is to figure out the rules that govern the formation of \"beams\" emanating from colored shapes, given a grid with these shapes and an expected output grid. Let's break it down:\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics:** The user wants me to solve this. I see distinct objects in the input. Each object has a core color and a border color (usually teal or a background color). Each object in the input has a central color and a surrounding ring. I'm looking for how this shape maps to \"beams\" on the output grid.\n2.  **Initial Hypothesis:** I start by looking at a number of examples. I see lines with the colors from the object in specific directions. I notice the shapes of the objects vary. They usually have a colored center and border 3 (or the same color of the background).\n3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** My initial intuition is that the direction of the beam is influenced by the shape of the border. I see that border pixel has \"gaps.\"\n4.  **The \"Nozzle\" Hypothesis:** The direction of the beam depends on which parts of the border are open and which parts are closed. Imagine each of the 3s as walls, and gaps are the openings the \"light\" shoots through. If a border pixel is part of the border, the beam is blocked. If an input grid value is the background, it means there is a gap that allows the beam to pass.\n5.  **Examine Corner Cases:** I look at various combinations of shapes. The beams shoot in orthogonal directions and diagonal directions. I look at each example very carefully to build a model that explains where the beams come from based on border geometry.\n6.  **Edge Analysis:** I think of a perimeter or \"border\" for the central core of pixels. This border has orthogonal edge pieces, and 4 corners. Border pixels can be open, closed, or part of a side. Beams can come from gaps or corners.\n7.  **Finalize the Model:** Each object has a specific pattern of open and closed sections that direct the beams. I formalize the rules: open is 8 (background color), a corner is open to diagonal.\n    *   I see a relationship: orthogonal directions come from border pixels, diagonal directions come from corner pixels, where pixels are background pixels.\n8.  **Test and Verify:** I run this model with all examples. It works!\n9.  **Execution Plan:** I map each shape from the initial grid input to its specific beam-launching configuration.\n10. **Test Data Application:** I take the test input, analyze the structure of each object, and create the projected output based on the model.\n11. **Grid Implementation:** I'm careful to address issues such as beam collisions. If overlapping occurs, the earlier beam overwrites the latest beam (or the latest one overrides, based on a pattern or object order, or maybe the source color).\n12. **Final Touches:** I generate the final output and check one last time.\n\nIn essence, it's about carefully interpreting geometric cues to decode the beam directionality rule.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I analyzed the provided examples to understand the relationship between the objects (colored cores surrounded by `3`-colored borders) and the beams of light they emit.\n\n**1. Object Structure:**\nEach object consists of a 2x2 core of a specific color `C`, surrounded by a ring of 12 pixels. The ring is primarily color `3` (green), acting as a \"nozzle\" or \"shield\". The pixels in this ring can be `3` (Closed) or `8` (Open/Background).\n\n**2. Transformation Rule:**\nThe beams emerge from the `Open` pixels (gaps) in the `3`-border. The direction of the beam depends on the position of the gap relative to the 2x2 core.\nMapping the 12 border positions (relative to a 4x4 box where the core is central):\n*   **Corners (TL, TR, BL, BR):** A gap in a corner emits a **Diagonal** beam in that direction.\n    *   Example: Top-Left Corner Gap -> Beam Up-Left.\n*   **Sides (Top, Bottom, Left, Right):** Each side has 2 pixels (e.g., Top-Left side `T1` and Top-Right side `T2`).\n    *   **Right-Half of an Edge (T2, R2, B2, L2):** Emits an **Orthogonal** beam (Up, Right, Down, Left).\n        *   Gap at Top-Right side (`T2`) -> Beam Up.\n        *   Gap at Right-Bottom side (`R2`) -> Beam Right.\n    *   **Left-Half of an Edge (T1, R1, B1, L1):** Emits a **Diagonal** beam or Horizontal/Vertical beam skewed to that side. Based on Examples 3 and 4, these produce beams consistent with the \"Propeller\" or specific diagonal logic:\n        *   Gap at Top-Left side (`T1`) -> Beam **Up-Left**.\n        *   Gap at Right-Top side (`R1`) -> Beam **Up-Right**.\n        *   Gap at Left-Top side (`L1`) -> Beam **Left** (Horizontal).\n        *   Gap at Left-Bottom side (`L2`) -> Beam **Down-Left**.\n\n**3. Applying to Test Input:**\nI identified 4 objects in the test input and applied the logic:\n\n*   **Object 1 (Red `2`, Top-Left):**\n    *   **Gap at T1** (Top edge, left pixel): Emits **Up-Left Diagonal**.\n    *   **Gap at L1** (Left edge, top pixel): Emits **Left Horizontal**.\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow `4`, Top-Right):**\n    *   **Gap at R1** (Right edge, top pixel): Emits **Up-Right Diagonal**.\n    *   **Gap at BL** (Bottom-Left Corner): Emits **Down-Left Diagonal**.\n*   **Object 3 (Green `7`, Middle-Right):**\n    *   **Gap at R1** (Right edge, top pixel): Emits **Up-Right Diagonal**.\n*   **Object 4 (Maroon `9`, Bottom-Left):**\n    *   **Gap at T2** (Top edge, right pixel): Emits **Up Vertical**.\n    *   **Gap at BR** (Bottom-Right Corner): Emits **Down-Right Diagonal**.\n\nI traced these beams on the 30x30 grid, handling intersections by prioritizing the object logic (Red overwrites Maroon at crossing points).\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,7,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,7,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,7,8\n8,8,8,8,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,8,9,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

It looks like we're dealing with grids of numbers that represent colored shapes. The primary goal is to predict the output grid based on the input.\n\n**Initial Observations**\n\nThe background is a teal color, and we have smaller colored structures, possibly squares or partial squares, with a central core of a different color. The key seems to be the relationship between the shapes of these colored structures in the input and the pattern of colored lines in the output. The structures have borders that contain gaps.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1.  **Structure of the Example**: Let's examine a specific example. We see a green border (color 3) surrounding a core of a different color. The gaps in these green borders seem crucial. It appears that the output lines emanate from these gaps.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis: Gap-Driven Line Generation**: Maybe the gaps in the border point to the direction of the lines. If there's no green pixel blocking a direction, a line of the core color \"shoots out\". For a 2x2 core: A core at (r,c), (r,c+1), (r+1,c), (r+1,c+1). The green pixels are at (r-1,c), (r-1,c+1), (r,c-1), (r,c+2), (r+1,c-1), (r+1,c+2), (r+2,c), (r+2,c+1). The \"gaps\" are the four corners of the border (r-1,c-1), (r-1,c+2), (r+2,c-1), (r+2,c+2). This \"gap hypothesis\" checks out for the first input. The output lines are in the diagonal direction of the gaps.\n\n3.  **Color Matters**: However, the example of a blue and maroon shape of the same geometry produces a different output. The color of the core must influence the output behavior. So, is there an odd/even correlation? Not apparent. This might mean we need a lookup table for the colors.\n\n4.  **Blue Exception**: The blue core shape with the same border geometry has vertical and horizontal output lines. Something is different with the Blue core. It might \"permeate\" the borders and be the exception. In fact, if we look at the image, Blue's corners are closed with green, while Maroon is open at the same locations. So the rule \"Shoot through Gap\" becomes \"Shoot through Wall\", so Blue and the shape produces lines perpendicular to the green pixels that close the geometry of the core.\n\n5.  **Revising the Hypothesis (Wall/Gap Shooter)**:\n    *   I'll call Blue a \"wall shooter\" (shooting through walls or green pixels) and all other cores are \"gap shooters\".\n    *   If color is blue, shoot a beam in the neighbor's location if it has a green pixel.\n    *   If color is not blue, shoot a beam in the neighbor's location if it has an empty pixel.\n\n6.  **Refinement - Granular \"Gap Shooter\"**: The initial model had gaps defined at the corner pixels. Instead, each individual pixel of the 2x2 core checks all outward-facing neighbors. For the Top-Left of Core: Up, Left, Up-Left. (and same thing with core's Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right)\n    *   **Blue cores**: The presence of green neighbors triggers beam generation. (Wall Shooter).\n    *   **Non-Blue cores**: The presence of empty neighbors triggers beam generation. (Gap Shooter).\n\n7.  **Final Model Verification**:\n    *   Using this hypothesis, apply it to the new input.\n    *   Scan the input grid for cores. The coordinates become available.\n    *   Identify the four 12 neighbors.\n    *   Apply the Blue exception. For Blue cores (color 1), a beam radiates in the direction of any green neighbor. For any other core, a beam radiates in the direction of empty space.\n    *   Draw the beams. If there is a \"collision\", overwrite (I'll assume a \"first come first serve\" rule or whatever the system's rule is for conflicts).\n\nThe final step will be to implement this approach on the example to see if all example outputs become reproducible with the proposed model.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rule is determined by the \"green casing\" (pixels of color 3) surrounding the 2x2 core of each object. The core color itself determines the color of the emitted beams, but the **direction** of the beams is determined by the **gaps** in the green casing.\n\n**Rule:**\n1.  Identify each object consisting of a 2x2 core of a unique color surrounded by green (3) pixels.\n2.  For each of the 4 pixels making up the 2x2 core, check its immediate outward-facing neighbors in the surrounding 1-pixel wide ring (orthogonal and diagonal).\n    *   **Top-Left Core Pixel**: Check Up, Left, and Up-Left neighbors.\n    *   **Top-Right Core Pixel**: Check Up, Right, and Up-Right neighbors.\n    *   **Bottom-Left Core Pixel**: Check Down, Left, and Bottom-Left neighbors.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Core Pixel**: Check Down, Right, and Bottom-Right neighbors.\n3.  If a neighbor is \"Open\" (color 8), a beam of the core's color is emitted in that direction.\n4.  The beam travels in a straight line until it hits the edge of the grid or another object.\n    *   **Exception**: If the core is Blue (1), it emits beams through the *Walls* (where the neighbor is 3) instead of gaps. However, there are no Blue cores in the test input.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Red Object (Color 2)** at R5-6, C4-5:\n    *   **Up**: The neighbor at R4, C4 is 8 (Open). **Beam Up**.\n    *   **Left**: The neighbor at R5, C3 is 8 (Open). **Beam Left**.\n    *   Other directions are blocked by 3s.\n\n2.  **Yellow Object (Color 4)** at R5-6, C15-16:\n    *   **Up-Left (NW)**: The neighbor at R4, C14 is 8 (Open). **Beam NW**.\n    *   **Right**: The neighbor at R5, C17 is 8 (Open). **Beam Right**.\n    *   **Down**: The neighbor at R7, C15 is 8 (Open). **Beam Down**.\n    *   Other directions are blocked.\n\n3.  **Magenta Object (Color 6)** at R14-15, C23-24:\n    *   **Up**: The neighbor at R13, C23 is 8 (Open). **Beam Up**.\n    *   **Up-Right (NE)**: The neighbor at R13, C25 is 8 (Open). **Beam NE**.\n    *   **Down-Right (SE)**: The neighbor at R16, C25 is 8 (Open). **Beam SE**.\n    *   Note: The SW corner at R16, C22 is 3 (Blocked).\n\n4.  **Orange Object (Color 7)** at R20-21, C22-23:\n    *   **Right**: The neighbor at R20, C24 is 8 (Open). **Beam Right**.\n    *   **Down-Right (SE)**: The neighbor at R22, C24 is 8 (Open). **Beam SE**.\n\n5.  **Maroon Object (Color 9)** at R25-26, C1-2:\n    *   **Up**: The neighbor at R24, C2 is 8 (Open). **Beam Up**.\n    *   **Down-Right (SE)**: The neighbor at R27, C3 is 8 (Open). **Beam SE**.\n\n**Generated Output:**\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,8,2,2,3,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into ARC Problem-Solving**\n\nAlright, let's break down this ARC problem. I'm seeing a pattern: the grids have a teal background, and small objects are popping up, each with a colored core enclosed by a green border. My first instinct is to try and define the object's structure, focusing on a typical object. It seems the green border isn't always a complete box; there are gaps. I want to nail down how those gaps affect the solution.\n\nI'm specifically looking at the relationships between the colors. My mind keeps flipping between individual objects, considering their position, and trying to trace the lines in relation to gaps and corners. In Example 1, I find the core of each object and then analyze the color layout. I can clearly see a circular layout with gaps in certain places. From looking, a gap in the green box leads to a projection of a line, but I can also see examples where there are no gaps but there still is projection.\n\nI am reevaluating the nature of 'gaps,' and I think the concept of 'walls' might provide an important concept in understanding this puzzle. I realize the structure of these lines is important, but how it emerges is much more fascinating. Now I know that, when fully enclosed, the lines originate outwards in all directions.\n\nIn Example 2, the grid has a yellow, 2x2 structure with different border colors. There is a gap at the top and the right, which creates an obvious line. These two experiments provide a pattern for the relationship between border gaps and the outward flow of colored lines. This proves that, when there is a lack of a wall, that line extends outward.\n\nNow I am going back, reevaluating the previous example images, and noticing diagonal lines. Looking at the yellow structure, I can see the lines are vertical and horizontal. It isn't random. The images are a perfect application of what I have discovered, so far.\n\nMy new hypothesis: *Lines emerge from the core color through gaps.*\n\nI've tested this hypothesis, but I noticed something was inconsistent with previous evidence. I am noticing that when two different lines encounter each other, they stop at the boundary where they intersect.\n\nI'm not so sure. Some of the test cases aren't working as well with my rules as I had hoped. The best approach is to examine each element of the layout: 1. Find all green, 2. Identify inner colored pixels, 3. find openings, and 4. draw the lines.\n\nIn the test case, I am seeing three objects. The red core is partially enclosed; the yellow core is enclosed with gaps on the side; the magenta is fully enclosed. All of these factors will influence how the object generates lines. The lines are also able to collide. I am confident I have all the pieces I need to write my solution.\n\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying colored objects enclosed in green borders and extending lines of the object's core color outwards.\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all objects consisting of a core of a specific color (not 8 or 3) surrounded by a green (3) border or partially surrounded.\n    *   **Red Object:** Core (2) at Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5.\n    *   **Yellow Object:** Core (4) at Rows 5-6, Cols 16-17.\n    *   **Magenta Object:** Core (6) at Rows 14-15, Cols 23-24.\n    *   **Orange Object:** Core (7) at Rows 20-21, Cols 22-23.\n\n2.  **Determine Line Directions:**\n    *   **Partially Enclosed Objects:** Lines extend from the core through any **gaps** (8s) in the immediate 4-neighbor green border.\n        *   **Red Object:**\n            *   Top Side (Row 4): Pattern `3, 8` above core `2, 2` (indices 4,5). Col 4 is `8` (Gap). -> **Line Up** from Col 4.\n            *   Left Side (Col 3): Pattern `8, 3` left of core `2, 2` (rows 5,6). Row 5 is `8` (Gap). -> **Line Left** from Row 5.\n        *   **Yellow Object:**\n            *   Right Side (Col 18): Pattern `8, 3` right of core `4, 4` (rows 5,6). Row 5 is `8` (Gap). -> **Line Right** from Row 5.\n            *   Bottom Side (Row 7): Pattern `8, 3` below core `4, 4` (indices 16,17). Col 16 is `8` (Gap). -> **Line Down** from Col 16.\n        *   **Orange Object:**\n            *   Top Side (Row 19): All `8`s. Core `7,7` (indices 22,23) is exposed. -> **Line Up** from Cols 22, 23.\n            *   Right Side (Col 24): Row 20 is `8` (Gap). -> **Line Right** from Row 20.\n    *   **Fully Enclosed Objects:** If the core is completely surrounded by green walls (no gaps), lines extend in **all 4 directions**.\n        *   **Magenta Object:** Surrounded by `3`s on all sides (Rows 13, 16 and Cols 22, 25). -> **Lines Up, Down, Left, Right**.\n            *   Up/Down from Cols 23, 24.\n            *   Left/Right from Rows 14, 15.\n\n3.  **Handle Interactions:**\n    *   Lines stop when they hit another line or object.\n    *   **Magenta Down** (Cols 23,24) meets **Orange Up** (Cols 22,23).\n        *   Col 23: Magenta moves down from Row 16. Orange moves up from Row 19. They meet at Rows 17, 18. Let's fill 17 with Magenta (6) and 18 with Orange (7).\n        *   Col 22: Orange Up fills column.\n        *   Col 24: Magenta Down fills column.\n    *   **Red** Line Up and Left extend to edges.\n    *   **Yellow** Line Right and Down extend to edges.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   **Background:** 8.\n*   **Red Lines:** Col 4 (Rows 0-3) becomes 2. Row 5 (Cols 0-2) becomes 2.\n*   **Yellow Lines:** Row 5 (Cols 19-29) becomes 4. Col 16 (Rows 8-29) becomes 4.\n*   **Magenta Lines:**\n    *   Up: Cols 23,24 (Rows 0-12) become 6.\n    *   Down: Col 24 (Rows 17-29) becomes 6. Col 23 (Row 17) becomes 6.\n    *   Left: Rows 14,15 (Cols 0-21) become 6.\n    *   Right: Rows 14,15 (Cols 26-29) become 6.\n*   **Orange Lines:**\n    *   Up: Col 22 (Rows 0-19) becomes 7. Col 23 (Row 18-19) becomes 7.\n    *   Right: Row 20 (Cols 25-29) becomes 7.\n\nNote: Where lines cross (e.g., Magenta Left crosses Red Up), usually the existing object or a dominant line logic applies. Based on Ex 1, lines stop at other colors.\n*   Magenta Left (Row 14,15) crosses Red Down (Red has no down line). It passes below Red.\n*   Magenta Left crosses Yellow Down (Col 16). Yellow is 4. Magenta is 6. They cross. In Ex 1, different colored lines crossing seemed to overwrite or stop. Let's assume they continue if perpendicular, or stop if head-on. Given the sparsity, they likely just cross (last drawn wins or logical layering). Let's assume Magenta (6) draws over empty space. The Yellow vertical line is at Col 16. Magenta Horizontal at Row 14,15. Intersection (14,16), (15,16).\n*   Magenta Up (Col 23) and Orange Up (Col 23). They are head-on. Magenta ends at 17. Orange ends at 18.\n\nCompleted Grid:\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,7,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,6,3,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nOne detail: Overlaps.\nAt (14,16) and (15,16), Magenta(6) crosses Yellow(4).\nI will preserve the Yellow vertical line as it is \"closer\" (in the test input structure, Yellow is left of Magenta).

No, Orange core is 20-21.\nOrange Up reaches 19?

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. Each shape has a 2x2 colored center surrounded by a green (3) border\n2. Gaps (8s) in the border indicate where lines should extend\n3. For gaps on edges (top/bottom/left/right): straight lines extend outward\n4. For corner gaps: diagonal lines extend outward\n5. Lines use the inner color of the shape and extend to the grid boundary\n\nLet me identify the shapes and their gaps in the test input:\n\n- Shape 1 (color 2): rows 4-7, cols 3-6 - gaps at top (col 4), left (col 3), bottom-right corner\n- Shape 2 (color 4): rows 4-7, cols 14-17 - gaps at top-left corner, right (col 17), bottom (col 15)\n- Shape 3 (color 6): rows 13-16, cols 22-25 - gaps at top (col 23), top-right corner, bottom-right corner\n- Shape 4 (color 7): rows 19-22, cols 21-24 - gaps at right (col 24), bottom-right corner\n- Shape 5 (color 9): rows 24-27, cols 0-3 - gaps at top (col 2), bottom-right corner\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the examples)\n\n**Background** is color **8**. Each \u201cdevice\u201d is a connected component made of:\n- a **frame** in color **3**\n- a **core** in some other single color (e.g. 2,4,6,7,9)\n\nFor each device:\n\n1. **Find its bounding box** (min/max row and col over all its non\u20118 cells).\n2. On the **border of that bounding box**, locate every cell that is **background (8)**.  \n   These are the device\u2019s **exits/openings**.\n3. For each opening, determine the **shoot direction** from its position on the bounding box border:\n   - top edge \u2192 shoot **up**\n   - bottom edge \u2192 shoot **down**\n   - left edge \u2192 shoot **left**\n   - right edge \u2192 shoot **right**\n   - corners shoot diagonally outward (e.g. top-left \u2192 up-left, bottom-right \u2192 down-right, etc.)\n4. **Draw a ray** of the device\u2019s core color starting at the opening cell and continuing step-by-step in that direction:\n   - paint cells while they are **still background (8)**\n   - **stop** just before the ray would enter a non\u20118 cell (original structure or previously drawn ray)\n5. To match interactions seen in the examples, process devices in **increasing core color** order; earlier rays block later ones.\n\nApplying this to the test grid yields the following output.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

Any neighbor cell that is still **background `8`** is an exit.\n3. **Determine the ray direction** for each exit:\n   - Choose an adjacent core cell that touches the exit with **minimum Manhattan distance** (so orthogonal adjacency is preferred over diagonal if both exist).\n   - The direction is the step `(dr, dc)` from that core cell to the exit cell (one of the 8 directions).\n4. **Draw the ray**: starting at the exit cell, repeatedly step by `(dr,dc)` and recolor background `8` cells to the core color until you would leave the grid or hit a non-`8` cell (frames/cores/previous rays block further extension).\n\nApply this to all objects in the grid.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Inputs consist of cyan background plus green frame-like objects that each contain a small colored \u201cpayload.\u201d\n* Outputs keep all original objects fixed and add thin paths drawn using the payload colors.\n* Added paths often run to grid borders (sometimes via staircase diagonals) and can form junctions where multiple paths meet.\n* Green is not used for the new drawing; it mainly serves to mark the source objects.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Alright, let's see. This ARC task is really about these \"paths\" or \"rays\" that are emitted from the corners of these colorful objects within a grid. My first thought is to understand how these rays are created and how they interact.\n\nI see that the color of these rays seems to depend on the color of the payload within each object. For example, a Maroon object emits Maroon rays. The shapes of these objects don't seem super important, but let's make a mental note about the green frames, like bounding boxes. The key seems to be the color and position of the object, plus how the rays interact.\n\nOkay, in example 1, it looks like rays shoot from the corners and when they meet, something happens. It also seems that there are 4 rays in total, from each corner. It is useful that the rays that emerge from neighboring frames are the same color. And they seem to be diagonal, but if they meet, they bend? Yes, it is the case.\n\nI'm starting to think about this in terms of \"interaction rules\" or \"collision rules.\" When rays from objects *come close*, they modify themselves. They also stop at the border of the grid. It's like a geometric problem. And the problem is about connecting the colored rectangles/objects with these colored rays and how they meet.\n\nThe examples are key. In example 1, I see that lines going to the sides meet, and then go up. And if the objects are close, they meet. If the objects are far, they go to the border, like two diagonal lines.\n\nAlso, the \"staircase\" hint is weird, but it seems that the rays that go diagonal, actually go a diagonal step then horizontal, almost like two rays. Sometimes they meet. The staircase hint must mean something.\n\nLet's look at it from a different angle.\n\nWhat's the relationship between the objects in the example output? Are the rays *connecting* anything? It looks like it.\n\nA more clear rule is coming into focus. Rays will be emitted from the *corners* of a simplified shape such as a bounding box. Then, when the rays meet, a rule applies. Also, the rays are only diagonal.\n\nOkay, if two rays come close, then vertical lines form. If the rays are more separated, they just go diagonally.\n\nLet's look at more examples. The behavior of the rays seems pretty consistent. When rays of the same color are next to one another, they combine.\n\nLet's summarize.\nFor now, the rules are:\n1.  From the objects, rays extend to the border of the image, the color of which matches the center object.\n2.  If two rays meet, they turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n\nIt seems to be all about the edges and corners of the objects and how they interact. If the objects don't interact, the lines will go to the side.\n\nOkay, let's look at example 2, 3 and 4 again.\n\nThis \"Test Input\" is helpful. I see how all the rays interact in different parts of the graph. Horizontal rays interact to make a straight horizontal line, vertical rays combine to make a straight horizontal line and diagonal rays continue without intersection to the border.\n\nNow, I think I have enough information to solve this and make a proper summary.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I identified the following rules based on the examples:\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The input contains objects defined by green (`3`) frames enclosing a core of a different color (the \"payload\"). The green frame marks the object's boundary.\n2.  **Ray Emission**: Each of the four corners of an object's bounding box emits a diagonal ray in the color of the payload.\n    *   Top-Left (TL) corner emits a ray Up-Left.\n    *   Top-Right (TR) corner emits a ray Up-Right.\n    *   Bottom-Left (BL) corner emits a ray Down-Left.\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR) corner emits a ray Down-Right.\n3.  **Ray Propagation & Interaction**:\n    *   Rays travel diagonally until they hit the grid border or interact with another ray.\n    *   **Horizontal Interaction**: If two objects are horizontally aligned (or close), their facing rays (e.g., UR of the left object and UL of the right object) converge. When they meet or become adjacent, they turn **vertical**.\n        *   Top rays turn Vertical Up.\n        *   Bottom rays turn Vertical Down.\n        *   The vertical lines run parallel if the gap allows, effectively extending from the convergence point to the grid edge.\n    *   **Vertical Interaction**: If two objects are vertically aligned, their facing rays (e.g., DL of the top object and UL of the bottom object) converge. When they meet or become adjacent, they turn **horizontal**.\n        *   Left-side rays turn Horizontal Left.\n        *   Right-side rays turn Horizontal Right.\n4.  **No Interaction**: Rays that do not encounter a matching ray from another object continue straight diagonally to the grid border.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Object 1 (Red, 2)**: Top-Left region (Row 4-7, Col 3-6).\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow, 4)**: Top-Right region (Row 4-7, Col 14-17).\n    *   **Interaction**: These form a horizontal pair.\n    *   **Top**: Red UR and Yellow UL converge at the top border (Col 10). Diagonal lines drawn to meet there.\n    *   **Bottom**: Red DR and Yellow DL converge below the objects. They turn vertical downwards at Row 10, running down Columns 9 and 11 respectively.\n*   **Object 3 (Magenta, 6)**: Middle-Right (Row 13-16, Col 22-25).\n*   **Object 4 (Orange, 7)**: Bottom-Right (Row 19-22, Col 21-24).\n    *   **Interaction**: These form a vertical pair.\n    *   **Left**: Magenta DL and Orange UL converge between the objects (Row 17/18). They turn Horizontal Left. Magenta's ray runs Left on Row 17. Orange's ray runs Left on Row 18.\n    *   **Right**: Magenta DR and Orange UR converge. They turn Horizontal Right on Row 17 (Magenta) and Row 18 (Orange).\n*   **Object 5 (Maroon, 9)**: Bottom-Left (Row 24-27, Col 0-3).\n    *   **Isolated**: No nearby objects for interaction. All 4 rays travel diagonally to the borders.\n\n**Generated Output Grid:**\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,2,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,2,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,6,0,0,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,6,0,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,6,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,3,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,3,7,7,8,8,7,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,7,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,7,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n3,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,9,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,7,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,9,8,8,2,8,4,8,7,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,9,8,2,8,4,7,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,5,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Inputs consist of cyan background plus green frame-like objects that each contain a small colored \u201cpayload.\u201d\n* Outputs keep all original objects fixed and add thin paths drawn using the payload colors.\n* Added paths often run to grid borders (sometimes via staircase diagonals) and can form junctions where multiple paths meet.\n* Green is not used for the new drawing; it mainly serves to mark the source objects.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Detailed Pathfinding Logic for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out.  The goal is to analyze these ARC tasks, figure out how they work and then generate the correct output.  I'll break this down:\n\n**1.  Initial Observations & Goal:** The user wants me to solve these ARC puzzles based on examples. I need to analyze how the *inputs* (cyan background, green \"frame-like\" objects with color payloads) translate into the *outputs* (which have paths drawn).\n\n**2.  Pattern Recognition:** I\u2019m noticing there's a specific pattern:\n\n    *   **Frame Structure:** The green frames mark the area where the path should emerge, but the actual path *doesn't* use green.\n    *   **Payload Colors:** There's a color \u201cpayload\u201d *inside* the green frame and that dictates the color of the path drawn.\n    *   **Hole Detection:** Where the frame is not *completely* closed - usually at corners/gaps - determines how the path starts and its initial direction! I kept thinking it was the entire shape of the green frame, but that's not it. It's about where the frame *stops*.\n    *   **Line Extension:** Once a *hole* is detected, the path \u201cleaks\u201d out. The direction the path goes appears to correspond to the *neighboring* cells of the payload. It\u2019s a neighbor \u201ccheck\u201d.\n    *   **Grid Boundaries:** The paths extend to the borders of the grid.  Sometimes these go through a \u201cstaircase\u201d diagonal.\n\n**3.  Important Insights:**\n\n    *   **Coordinate system/Indices:** I re-read carefully, because it's easy to make mistakes with this kind of data!\n    *   **Vector Rules:** So far, it looks like a neighbor check to determine \"holes\" in the grid.\n    *   **Diagonal Paths vs. Shift:** I've had to throw out the simple idea of \"perfect diagonals\" because they don't apply, *always*.\n    *   **Overlapping Paths:** I will take into account *overlapping* path cells, just to be precise.  These will *not* be a problem though.\n\n**4.  Test Input Analysis (Most Important Part):** I'll use a test input to confirm everything. I'm going to determine \"holes\", vector rules and directions.\n\n**5.  Output Generation Process:** I\u2019ll now go through all the objects in the test input, identify the \"Hole\", the path vector (based on the neighboring cells) and generate all of the coordinates for the path. I won't *overwrite* any existing *non-8* values, which means objects *won't* have paths drawn *over* them. I'll need a *string-based* output format to represent this.\n\n**6.  Final Coordinate Generation:** I'll map all the individual coordinate points I found and I'll build the output string, which will now have the paths added.\n\nI believe this is all the logic. I can see I've double checked for all possible errors.\n\n\nThe task requires identifying \"objects\" in the grid (defined by green frames containing colored payloads) and extending \"paths\" from them. Based on the analysis of the solved examples, the rule for generating these paths is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Each object consists of a green (3) frame surrounding a 2x2 block of \"payload\" pixels (other colors like 9, 1, 4, 6, 2, 7).\n2.  **Locate \"Holes\":** Examine the 8 immediate neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) of each pixel in the 2x2 payload.\n    *   If a neighbor is a background pixel (8) (i.e., there is a gap in the green frame), it is considered a \"Hole\".\n3.  **Extend Paths:** For each payload pixel with a neighboring Hole, draw a path starting from that Hole.\n    *   **Color:** The path takes the color of the payload.\n    *   **Direction:** The direction is defined by the vector from the Payload pixel to the Hole pixel.\n        *   Example: If the Hole is directly above the Payload pixel, the path goes vertically UP.\n        *   Example: If the Hole is diagonally down-right from the Payload pixel, the path goes diagonally DOWN-RIGHT.\n    *   **Length:** The path extends in a straight line until it hits the grid boundary.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Object 1 (Red 2, Top-Left):**\n    *   Hole at `(4,4)` (Top of Payload `(5,4)`). Vector: UP. Path: Red vertical line at column 4 from row 3 to 0.\n    *   Hole at `(5,3)` (Left of Payload `(5,4)`). Vector: LEFT. Path: Red horizontal line at row 5 from column 2 to 0.\n    *   Hole at `(7,6)` (Down-Right of Payload `(6,5)`). Vector: DOWN-RIGHT. Path: Red diagonal line starting at `(8,7)`.\n\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow 4, Top-Right):**\n    *   Hole at `(5,17)` (Right of Payload `(5,16)`). Vector: RIGHT. Path: Yellow horizontal line at row 5 from column 18 to 29.\n    *   Hole at `(7,15)` (Down of Payload `(6,15)`). Vector: DOWN. Path: Yellow vertical line at column 15 from row 8 to 29.\n\n*   **Object 3 (Magenta 6, Mid-Right):**\n    *   Hole at `(13,23)` (Top of Payload `(14,23)`). Vector: UP. Path: Magenta vertical line at column 23 from row 12 to 0.\n    *   Hole at `(16,25)` (Down-Right of Payload `(15,24)`). Vector: DOWN-RIGHT. Path: Magenta diagonal line starting at `(17,26)`.\n\n*   **Object 4 (Orange 7, Bottom-Mid):**\n    *   Hole at `(20,24)` (Right of Payload `(20,23)`). Vector: RIGHT. Path: Orange horizontal line at row 20 from column 25 to 29.\n    *   Hole at `(22,24)` (Down-Right of Payload `(21,23)`). Vector: DOWN-RIGHT. Path: Orange diagonal line starting at `(23,25)`.\n\n*   **Object 5 (Maroon 9, Bottom-Left):**\n    *   Hole at `(24,2)` (Top of Payload `(25,2)`). Vector: UP. Path: Maroon vertical line at column 2 from row 23 to 0.\n    *   Hole at `(27,3)` (Down-Right of Payload `(26,2)`). Vector: DOWN-RIGHT. Path: Maroon diagonal line starting at `(28,4)`.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\nI will map these paths onto the input grid, replacing the background '8's with the corresponding colors.\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Inputs consist of cyan background plus green frame-like objects that each contain a small colored \u201cpayload.\u201d\n* Outputs keep all original objects fixed and add thin paths drawn using the payload colors.\n* Added paths often run to grid borders (sometimes via staircase diagonals) and can form junctions where multiple paths meet.\n* Green is not used for the new drawing; it mainly serves to mark the source objects.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the pattern:\n\n1. Each input contains \"frame\" objects made of 3s (green) with a colored \"payload\" inside\n2. Gaps in the frames indicate where paths should emanate from\n3. Paths are drawn using the payload color:\n   - Top edge gaps \u2192 paths go upward\n   - Bottom edge gaps \u2192 paths go downward  \n   - Left edge gaps \u2192 paths go leftward\n   - Right edge gaps \u2192 paths go rightward\n   - Corner gaps \u2192 diagonal paths in that direction\n4. Paths extend to grid boundaries\n5. Original frames and payloads are preserved\n\n**Analyzing the test input frames:**\n\n- **Frame 1** (rows 4-7, cols 3-6, payload=2): Gaps at (4,4) top, (5,3) left, (7,6) bottom-right corner\n- **Frame 2** (rows 4-7, cols 14-17, payload=4): Gaps at (4,14) top-left corner, (5,17) right, (7,15) bottom\n- **Frame 3** (rows 13-16, cols 22-25, payload=6): Gaps at (13,23) top, (13,25) & (16,25) corners\n- **Frame 4** (rows 19-22, cols 21-24, payload=7): Gaps at (20,24) & (22,24) right side\n- **Frame 5** (rows 24-27, cols 0-3, payload=9): Gaps at (24,2) top, (27,3) bottom-right corner\n\n**Drawing paths from each gap:**\n- 9 (Frame 5): vertical up col 2, diagonal down-right from (27,3)\n- 2 (Frame 1): vertical up col 4, horizontal left row 5, diagonal down-right from (7,6)\n- 4 (Frame 2): diagonal up-left from (4,14), horizontal right row 5, vertical down col 15\n- 6 (Frame 3): vertical up col 23, diagonals from corners\n- 7 (Frame 4): horizontal right row 20, diagonal down-right from (22,24)\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Inputs consist of cyan background plus green frame-like objects that each contain a small colored \u201cpayload.\u201d\n* Outputs keep all original objects fixed and add thin paths drawn using the payload colors.\n* Added paths often run to grid borders (sometimes via staircase diagonals) and can form junctions where multiple paths meet.\n* Green is not used for the new drawing; it mainly serves to mark the source objects.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Keep all original cells unchanged; only add these new colored paths.\n\n(When multiple objects exist, earlier-drawn paths can block later ones; this naturally creates endpoints/junctions.)\n\n---\n\n### Completed output grid\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Inputs consist of cyan background plus green frame-like objects that each contain a small colored \u201cpayload.\u201d\n* Outputs keep all original objects fixed and add thin paths drawn using the payload colors.\n* Added paths often run to grid borders (sometimes via staircase diagonals) and can form junctions where multiple paths meet.\n* Green

(locations, orientations, bounding boxes)\n* What changes from input to output? (additions, removals, movements)\n* What stays the same?

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\n### Common to all pairs\n- **Background** is a uniform light blue/cyan.\n- There are one or more **green connected components** that look like small \u201cframes/brackets\u201d (hollow-ish shapes).\n- Each green component contains a **non-green colored patch** inside it (e.g., red, blue, yellow, pink, orange).  \n- In the **outputs**, the original green components and their interior colored patches stay in the **same positions** and keep the **same shapes**.\n\n### Pair 1\n**Input 1**\n- Four separate green objects on a cyan background:\n  - Three small green frame-like objects in the upper/middle area, arranged roughly in a row. Each contains a different inner color (dark red/maroon, dark blue, yellow).\n  - One larger green \u201cC\u201d-like object in the lower-left area containing a pink/magenta patch.\n  \n**Output 1**\n- All four original green objects remain unchanged.\n- Additional **1-cell-wide colored paths/lines** appear on the cyan background:\n  - New pixels use **the same non-green colors** seen inside the green objects (red/maroon, blue, yellow, pink).\n  - Several paths are **straight** and some are **staircase-like diagonals** (stepwise).\n  - Paths reach toward **edges** of the grid and also form **junction/crossing areas** where multiple colors appear close together (small mixed clusters where paths meet).\n\n### Pair 2\n**Input 2**\n- One green frame-like object containing a yellow patch, on cyan background.\n\n**Output 2**\n- The same green object remains.\n- A **yellow path** is added, forming a clear **angled (\u201cL\u201d-like)** extension reaching out to the grid boundary (touching at least one edge; appears to touch two edges via a corner/turn).\n\n### Pair 3\n**Input 3**\n- Three green frame-like objects on cyan background:\n  - One with red inside (upper-left region).\n  - One with yellow inside (right-of-center region).\n  - One with orange inside (lower-left region).\n\n**Output 3**\n- All three original objects remain.\n- Added colored paths appear in **red, yellow, orange**:\n  - Multiple **horizontal segments** and at least one **staircase diagonal** segment are visible.\n  - The added segments extend toward edges and meet/approach other drawn segments in places.\n\n### Pair 4\n**Input 4**\n- One green frame-like object containing a pink/magenta patch, near the upper-left region.\n\n**Output 4**\n- The same green object remains.\n- A **pink/magenta staircase-diagonal path** is added, running from near the object toward the grid boundary (touching the top/left boundary region in the drawing).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement**: **absent**\n- **Object recoloring**: **present** (background cells become colored along new paths; original objects keep colors)\n- **Bordering / outlining**: **maybe** (new markings often touch borders, but not clearly outlining existing shapes)\n- **Filling holes or cavities**: **absent**\n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape**: **absent**\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning**: **absent**\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**: **maybe** (new paths frequently terminate at edges/corners)\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**: **maybe** (the rare \u201cinner\u201d colors are reused to draw new content)\n- **Size-based filtering or selection**: **absent** (no clear evidence only largest/smallest is chosen)\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations**: **absent**\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**: **present** (growth-like extension of colored pixels into longer paths)\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**: **absent**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **New drawing uses the inner colors, not green**: the added pixels in the outputs match the non-green colors found inside the green frames; green shapes themselves are not expanded into the new paths.\n2. **The green \u201cframes\u201d behave like sources/emitters**: every instance (even when only one exists) triggers creation of an external path, implying the transformation is driven by detecting these framed colored patches.\n3. **Paths are grid-geometric (orthogonal + staircase diagonals)**: diagonal-looking connections are represented as **Manhattan staircases**, suggesting shortest-path / directional routing rather than arbitrary curves.\n4. **Edges/corners appear to be implicit targets**: in single-object examples, a path still reaches boundary, indicating the operation is not purely \u201cconnect objects together\u201d; the border can be a destination.\n5. **Multi-source interaction produces junction patterns**: when multiple paths are present, they appear to meet/cross, creating small mixed-color junction areas rather than simply stopping far away from each other.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nThe transformation detects each green frame-like object and uses its enclosed non-green color as an \u201cink\u201d to draw one or more **1-cell-wide routes** extending outward onto the cyan background. These routes travel in simple grid directions (often including staircase diagonals) until they reach a **boundary** and, in multi-object cases, may meet/cross other routes producing structured junctions.\n\nIf ambiguous, two close rule families are:  \n- **\u201cEmit beams from frame openings toward the border\u201d** (direction determined by the frame\u2019s geometry/orientation), or  \n- **\u201cRoute shortest-path connections from each framed color to a specific edge/corner anchor\u201d** (with special handling when routes interact).\n\n---\n\n## 5. List checks you would perform when solving\n\n1. **Locate each green frame\u2019s \u201copening/orientation\u201d** (missing side/corner) and verify whether the new path starts exactly from that opening cell.\n2. **Determine path destination rule**: does each path always end at the nearest edge, a specific corner, or the first boundary reached in a given direction?\n3. **Count outputs per object**: does each object generate exactly one path, or multiple (e.g., an L-shape implies two legs/directions)?\n4. **Intersection handling**: when two paths meet, check whether one overwrites the other, they stop, or they create a repeatable mixed/checker/staggered junction pattern.\n5. **Confirm color mapping**: ensure every new pixel color is always taken from the corresponding object\u2019s interior patch (and not from green/background).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* Inputs consist of cyan background plus green frame-like objects that each contain a small colored \u201cpayload.\u201d\n* Outputs keep all original objects fixed and add thin paths drawn using the payload colors.\n* Added paths often run to grid borders (sometimes via staircase diagonals) and can form junctions where multiple paths meet.\n* Green is not used for the new drawing; it mainly serves to mark the source objects.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n- Background: Color 8\n- Framed Regions: Border color 3, Inner colors {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}\n- Lines/Beams: Colors {1, 2, 4, 9}\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1) Find each 3-bordered frame and its interior color X (X \u2208 {1,2,4,6,7,9}).  \n2) On each frame\u2019s bounding-rectangle perimeter, any 8 \u201cgap\u201d in the 3 border is an opening.  \n3) Recolor each opening from 8 \u2192 X.  \n4) From each filled opening, draw a straight beam of color X outward (N/S/E/W or diagonal based on direction from nearest interior X to the opening), painting only 8 cells.  \n5) Stop beams at the grid edge or before/at the first non-8 cell (3 borders, other objects, other beams).  \n6) With multiple frames, beams can block each other.  \n7) In some cases a beam may also continue/turn diagonally from its endpoint (possible chained/deflected extension).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, here's my understanding of the ARC task, as I see it:**\n\nThe goal is to transform a grid based on rectangular objects bordered by a specific color (3, teal). Inside these borders, there's another color, which I'll call the \"core color.\" The transformation involves filling gaps in the border and extending \"beams\" of the core color outwards from these filled gaps.\n\n**My Approach:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** I'll begin by locating the rectangular objects within the grid. These are defined by the continuous lines of color 3 (teal).\n2.  **Determine Core Color:** Once I have an object, I'll extract the dominant color within the object's border. That is the color which needs to be beammed.\n3.  **Find Gaps:** The key is finding where the border (color 3) is *incomplete*. I'll compare the \"ideal\" rectangular border dimensions with the actual border. Where there is a discontinuity, I have a gap.\n4.  **Determine Beam Direction:** The beam's direction depends on the gap's position relative to the object's center. Gaps located at corners will send out diagonal beams. Side gaps radiate orthogonal beams.\n5.  **Simulate Beams:** I'll trace these beams until they hit the grid's edge or another object. The beams can block or deflect each other, which is where things get interesting. I should be able to predict the beam path based on its starting point and the directions of the other beams.\n\n**Refinements:**\n\n*   **Collisions:** When beams collide, they can deflect or merge, changing their direction based on a well defined logic. The rules depend on incoming vectors, and the beam will change accordingly.\n*   **Beam Stopping Condition:** Beams will stop either when they reach the edge of the grid or hit an object. This is a very common condition in programming, so I understand this concept very well.\n*   **Chained/Deflected Extension:** This could be the most complex condition. When a beam is deflected, it becomes the new origin for a new beam. This is a very interesting concept.\n\nI have broken down the test input and performed an iterative tracing analysis of the behavior, focusing on these points. My mental model uses vector calculations and a simulation of the beam propagation to solve the problem.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, we must simulate the propagation of \"beams\" of color from specific openings in the \"frames\" present in the grid.\n\n### Analysis of Transformation Rules\n\n1.  **Identify Objects**: Locate rectangular frames bordered by color 3 (green). Each frame encloses a specific interior color $C$.\n    *   The frame definition includes the 3-colored border and the interior region.\n    *   Gaps (color 8) on the perimeter of this frame are the \"sources\" for beams.\n\n2.  **Initialize Beams**:\n    *   Fill each gap with the interior color $C$.\n    *   Determine the beam direction from the gap position relative to the nearest interior pixel of color $C$:\n        *   **Corner Gap**: Beams emit diagonally (NW, NE, SW, SE).\n        *   **Side Gap**: Beams emit orthogonally (N, S, W, E).\n\n3.  **Propagate Beams**:\n    *   Beams travel in straight lines until they encounter an obstacle (grid edge, existing object, or another beam).\n    *   **Collisions/Interactions**:\n        *   **Beam-Beam Deflection**: If a beam hits another beam, it may deflect. \n            *   *Orthogonal hitting Orthogonal* (e.g., North beam hits West beam): The beam deflects into the diagonal sum of the vectors (e.g., N + W = NW).\n            *   *Converging Collision* (e.g., SE beam meets S beam): The beams turn to run parallel/adjacent in the dominant direction (e.g., both go South).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution for Test Input\n\n**1. Object Identification:**\n*   **Obj 1 (Bottom-Left)**: Rows 24-27, Cols 0-3. Interior **9** (Maroon).\n*   **Obj 2 (Top-Left)**: Rows 4-7, Cols 3-6.

Interior **6** (Magenta).\n*   **Obj 5 (Bottom-Mid)**: Rows 19-22, Cols 21-24. Interior **7** (Orange).\n\n**2. Source Identification & Beam Initialization:**\n*   **Obj 1 (Color 9)**:\n    *   Gap (24, 2) [Top Side] $\\rightarrow$ **North**.\n    *   Gap (27, 3) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE**.\n*   **Obj 2 (Color 2)**:\n    *   Gap (4, 4) [Top Side] $\\rightarrow$ **North**.\n    *   Gap (5, 3) [Left Side] $\\rightarrow$ **West**.\n    *   Gap (7, 6) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE**.\n*   **Obj 3 (Color 4)**:\n    *   Gap (5, 17) [Right Side] $\\rightarrow$ **East**.\n    *   Gap (7, 15) [Bottom Side] $\\rightarrow$ **South**.\n*   **Obj 4 (Color 6)**:\n    *   Gap (13, 23) [Top Side] $\\rightarrow$ **North**.\n    *   Gap (13, 25) [TR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **NE**.\n    *   Gap (16, 25) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE**.\n*   **Obj 5 (Color 7)**:\n    *   Gap (20, 24) [Right Side] $\\rightarrow$ **East**.\n    *   Gap (22, 24) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE**.\n\n**3. Simulation & Interactions:**\n\n*   **Beam 2 (Obj 2, North)**: From (4,4) up to (0,4). Path is clear.\n*   **Beam 4 (Obj 2, West)**: From (5,3) left to (5,0). Path is clear.\n*   **Beam 1 (Obj 1, North)**: Starts at (24,2). Travels North up Col 2.\n    *   At (5,2), it hits **Beam 4** (horizontal at Row 5).\n    *   Collision: North + West $\\rightarrow$ **NW**.\n    *   Deflection path: (4,1), (3,0).\n*   **Beam 2 (Obj 1, SE)**: Starts (27,3). Path: (28,4), (29,5). Hits edge.\n*   **Beam 6 (Obj 3, East)**: From (5,17) right to (5,29). Path is clear.\n*   **Beam 7 (Obj 3, South)**: From (7,15) down to (29,15).\n*   **Beam 5 (Obj 2, SE)**: Starts (7,6). Path: (8,7)...(15,14).\n    *   Next step would be (16,15). **Beam 7** is at (16,15).\n    *   Collision: SE beam meets S beam. They turn adjacent South.\n    *   Deflection path: Turns South at Col 14. Path (16,14) to (29,14).\n*   **Beam 8 (Obj 4, North)**: From (13,23) up to (0,23). Path is clear.\n*   **Beam 9 (Obj 4, NE)**: From (13,25). Path: (12,26), (11,27), (10,28), (9,29).\n*   **Beam 10 (Obj 4, SE)**: From (16,25). Path: (17,26), (18,27), (19,28), (20,29).\n*   **Beam 11 (Obj 5, East)**: From (20,24). Path right along Row 20.\n    *   At (20,29), it hits **Beam 10** (which arrives at step 4, while Beam 11 arrives at step 5).\n    *   Beam 11 stops at (20,28).\n*   **Beam 12 (Obj 5, SE)**: From (22,24). Path: (23,25), (24,26), (25,27), (26,28), (27,29).\n\n### Final Grid Generation\n\nWe apply the calculated paths to the grid.\n\n*   **(4,4)** fills 2.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n- Background: Color 8\n- Framed Regions: Border color 3, Inner colors {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}\n- Lines/Beams: Colors {1, 2, 4, 9}\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1) Find each 3-bordered frame and its interior color X (X \u2208 {1,2,4,6,7,9}).  \n2) On each frame\u2019s bounding-rectangle perimeter, any 8 \u201cgap\u201d in the 3 border is an opening.  \n3) Recolor each opening from 8 \u2192 X.  \n4) From each filled opening, draw a straight beam of color X outward (N/S/E/W or diagonal based on direction from nearest interior X to the opening), painting only 8 cells.  \n5) Stop beams at the grid edge or before/at the first non-8 cell (3 borders, other objects, other beams).  \n6) With multiple frames, beams can block each other.  \n7) In some cases a beam may also continue/turn diagonally from its endpoint (possible chained/deflected extension).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I think about solving this ARC task:**\n\nI'm given examples and I have to find the pattern. It seems like the core concept is about creating beams of color from framed regions. \n\n**First**, I have to identify these framed regions. They look like rectangles bordered by a specific color, but with gaps in the border. The color inside the rectangle is also important - that's the color that will be used for the beam. The background is a consistent color throughout.\n\n**Second**, I noticed the \"gaps\" in the frames are key. These gaps, which are actually sections of the background color within what should be a solid border, are the launch points of the beams.\n\n**Third**, I generate rules:\n1.  **Identify Frames:** It's all about rectangles with borders.\n2.  **Find the Gaps:** Look at the border and see where there are open spots (background color instead of the border).\n3.  **Fill the Gap:** I have to color the gap with the \"inner\" color of the frame.\n4.  **Project Beam:** The main move! From each filled gap, I have to draw a straight line of the inner color outwards. The direction of this beam seems to depend on the gap's location: Top gap is up, Bottom gap is down, etc. I also realized that diagonal beams are used when the gap is in a corner.\n\n**Fourth**, I had to carefully look at examples, especially when a frame's edge or corner had a gap. For example, in Example 1, the corner gaps generated diagonal beams. It was tricky to figure out the exact coordinates and what's meant by an open corner.  Example 2 was a bit easier because it was smaller. I had to pay close attention to the input grid's values!\n\n**Fifth, I considered beam collisions.** Beams seem to have their own rules. They can stop when they hit non-background color cells, existing beams, or even the grid's edge.\n\n**Sixth, I got the test input. It was bigger!** I took my rules and checked that they still work with all the shapes. I also discovered there could be multiple frames. I had to draw everything out to confirm.\n\nI then did what I needed to:\n*   I filled the gaps.\n*   Then, I drew all the beams step-by-step.\n*   I carefully check how beams meet. When the beams meet, one must yield, to avoid errors.\n\nIt takes time, but I think I have it. I need to output based on these instructions!\n\nTo solve this challenge, I will first identify the \"framed regions\" in the input grid. Each frame is bounded by color 3 (green) and contains a solid block of a specific \"inner color\". The transformation involves identifying \"gaps\" (cells of color 8) in the border of these frames, filling them with the inner color, and projecting beams of that color outwards from the gap.\n\n**1. Analyze the Input and Identify Frames:**\n\n*   **Frame 1 (Red, Color 2):**\n    *   **Location:** Rows 4-7, Columns 3-6.\n    *   **Inner Block:** Color 2 at R5-6, C4-5.\n    *   **Gaps in Border:**\n        *   **Top Edge:** R4, C4 is 8. (Action: Beam Up).\n        *   **Left Edge:** R5, C3 is 8. (Action: Beam Left).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner:** R7, C6 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Down-Right).\n\n*   **Frame 2 (Yellow, Color 4):**\n    *   **Location:** Rows 4-7, Columns 15-18.\n    *   **Inner Block:** Color 4 at R5-6, C16-17.\n    *   **Gaps in Border:**\n        *   **Right Edge:** R5, C18 is 8. (Action: Beam Right).\n        *   **Bottom Edge:** R7, C16 is 8. (Action: Beam Down).\n        *   **Top-Right Corner:** R4, C18 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Up-Right).\n\n*   **Frame 3 (Magenta, Color 6):**\n    *   **Location:** Rows 13-16, Columns 22-25.\n    *   **Inner Block:** Color 6 at R14-15, C23-24.\n    *   **Gaps in Border:**\n        *   **Top Edge:** R13, C23 is 8. (Action: Beam Up).\n        *   **Top-Right Corner:** R13, C25 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Up-Right).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner:** R16, C25 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Down-Right).\n\n*   **Frame 4 (Orange, Color 7):**\n    *   **Location:** Rows 20-23, Columns 21-24.\n    *   **Inner Block:** Color 7 at R21-22, C22-23.\n    *   **Gaps in Border:**\n        *   **Right Edge:** R21, C24 is 8. (Action: Beam Right).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner:** R23, C24 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Down-Right).\n\n*   **Frame 5 (Maroon, Color 9):**\n    *   **Location:** Rows 25-28, Columns 0-3.\n    *   **Inner Block:** Color 9 at R26-27, C1-2.\n    *   **Gaps in Border:**\n        *   **Top Edge:** R25, C2 is 8. (Action: Beam Up).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner:** R28, C3 is 8. (Action: Beam Diagonal Down-Right).\n\n**2. Simulate Beam Projections and Resolve Collisions:**\n\nBeams stop when they hit the grid edge or a non-8 cell. Collisions are resolved based on distance from source (first arrival wins).\n\n*   **Collision 1 (R5, C2):**\n    *   **Beam A:** Frame 1 Left Beam (Color 2). Source R5, C3. Distance to C2 is 1.\n    *   **Beam B:** Frame 5 Top Beam (Color 9). Source R25, C2. Distance to R5 is 20.\n    *   **Result:** Beam A arrives first. R5, C2 becomes 2. Beam B stops at R6, C2.\n\n*   **Collision 2 (R5, C23):**\n    *   **Beam A:** Frame 2 Right Beam (Color 4). Source R5, C18. Distance to C23 is 5.\n    *   **Beam B:** Frame 3 Top Beam (Color 6). Source R13, C23. Distance to R5 is 8.\n    *   **Result:** Beam A arrives first. R5, C23 becomes 4. Beam B stops at R6, C23.\n\n*   **Collision 3 (R17, C16):**\n    *   **Beam A:** Frame 1 Diagonal Down-Right (Color 2). Source R7, C6. Distance to (17,16) is 10 steps.\n    *   **Beam B:** Frame 2 Vertical Down (Color 4). Source R7, C16. Distance to R17 is 10 steps.\n    *   **Result:** Simultaneous arrival. Based on similar structures in example solutions, Vertical beams tend to block Diagonal ones. R17, C16 becomes 4. Beam A stops at R16, C15.\n\n**3.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n- Background: Color 8\n- Framed Regions: Border color 3, Inner colors {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}\n- Lines/Beams: Colors {1, 2, 4, 9}\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1) Find each 3-bordered frame and its interior color X (X \u2208 {1,2,4,6,7,9}).  \n2) On each frame\u2019s bounding-rectangle perimeter, any 8 \u201cgap\u201d in the 3 border is an opening.  \n3) Recolor each opening from 8 \u2192 X.  \n4) From each filled opening, draw a straight beam of color X outward (N/S/E/W or diagonal based on direction from nearest interior X to the opening), painting only 8 cells.  \n5) Stop beams at the grid edge or before/at the first non-8 cell (3 borders, other objects, other beams).  \n6) With multiple frames, beams can block each other.  \n7) In some cases a beam may also continue/turn diagonally from its endpoint (possible chained/deflected extension).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n- Background: Color 8\n- Framed Regions: Border color 3, Inner colors {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}\n- Lines/Beams: Colors {1, 2, 4, 9}\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1) Find each 3-bordered frame and its interior color X (X \u2208 {1,2,4,6,7,9}).  \n2) On each frame\u2019s bounding-rectangle perimeter, any 8 \u201cgap\u201d in the 3 border is an opening.  \n3) Recolor each opening from 8 \u2192 X.  \n4) From each filled opening, draw a straight beam of color X outward (N/S/E/W or diagonal based on direction from nearest interior X to the opening), painting only 8 cells.  \n5) Stop beams at the grid edge or before/at the first non-8 cell (3 borders, other objects, other beams).  \n6) With multiple frames, beams can block each other.  \n7) In some cases a beam may also continue/turn diagonally from its endpoint (possible chained/deflected extension).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Beams **do not overwrite** non-background cells, so previously painted content blocks later beam propagation.\n\nApplying that to the test grid yields:\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n- Background: Color 8\n- Framed Regions: Border color 3, Inner colors {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}\n- Lines/Beams: Colors {1, 2, 4, 9}\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1) Find each 3-bordered frame and its interior color X (X \u2208 {1,2,4,6,7,9}).  \n2) On each frame\u2019s bounding-rectangle perimeter, any 8 \u201cgap\u201d in the 3 border is an opening.  \n3) Recolor each opening from 8 \u2192 X.  \n4) From each filled opening, draw a straight beam of color X outward (N/S/E/W or diagonal based on direction from nearest interior X to the opening), painting only 8 cells.  \n5) Stop beams at the grid edge or before/at the first non-8 cell (3 borders, other objects, other beams).  \n6) With multiple frames, beams can block each other.  \n7) In some cases a beam may also continue/turn diagonally from its endpoint (possible chained/deflected extension).\n\nRespond

                "response": "**My Analysis of the Grid Data**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this. First, I need to understand the goal. I've got a series of grids, and I need to describe the object types and their characteristics. However, I can't infer rules or relationships between the grids, and I have to stick to numeric color values (0-9). I also need to present the information in a specific format: text description followed by a summary in XML tags.\n\nSo, I start by looking at the grids one by one. The first thing I notice is that color 8 is everywhere, almost like a constant background. Then, I look for recurring patterns or structures. In the first grid, I see what looks like a rough square or rectangular shape framed by color 3, and it contains pixels of color 6. In subsequent grids, a consistent theme emerges: shapes framed by color 3 with contents of other colors. These interior colors include 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 1. The frames are roughly square or rectangular, and sometimes they're incomplete, with gaps. There are also long, straight lines of color 1, 2, 4, and 9 running across the grids.\n\nFrom this, I can start to synthesize the object types. The background is color 8. The primary objects are what I'd call \"containers\" or \"frames,\" consistently defined by a color 3 border. Inside these frames, there's usually a central region filled with another color, such as 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, or 1. Sometimes the interior matches the border (3) or is empty (8). There are also these \"linear objects,\" or \"beams,\" that run vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.\n\nI keep reviewing each grid to make sure I don't miss anything. Then, I start drafting the description. It needs to be clear and concise, without making assumptions. I make sure I include the background (color 8), the framed shapes (color 3 border, variable interior), and the lines (colors 1, 2, 4, 9). I'm careful to use only the numeric color values. I also verify I've listed all the different inner colors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9.\n\nFinally, I need to create the XML summary. It's straightforward: background (color 8), frames (color 3 border, interior colors), and the beams (colors 1, 2, 4, 9). And I'm ready to output my work.\n\n<objects_summary>\n- Background: Color 8\n- Framed Regions: Border color 3, Inner colors {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}\n- Lines/Beams: Colors {1, 2, 4, 9}\n</objects_summary>\n\n\nThe grids primarily contain distinct composite objects set against a uniform background.\n\n**Background**\nThe canvas of every grid is filled with color 8, which serves as the negative space or background for all other objects.\n\n**Framed \"Box\" Objects**\nThe most prominent objects are square or rectangular composite shapes acting as containers.\n*   **Border:** These objects are defined by an outer boundary or frame made of color 3. The border is typically one pixel wide. In many instances, the border forms a complete square loop, but in some cases, the color 3 border is fragmented, discontinuous, or missing corner pieces (replaced by color 8).\n*   **Interior:** Enclosed within the color 3 border is a core area, often a 2x2 or similar rectangular block of pixels. The color of this interior core varies across different distinct objects. Observed interior colors include color 1, color 2, color 4, color 6, color 7, and color 9. In some instances, the interior might also be color 3 (creating a solid block) or contain patterns of color 8.\n\n**Linear \"Beam\" Objects**\nSeveral grids feature long, straight lines or \"beams\" that extend across the height or width of the grid.\n*   These lines are typically one pixel wide and consist of a single uniform color.\n*   Colors observed forming these linear objects include color 1, color 2, color 4, and color 9.\n*   These lines often span the entire dimension of the grid or terminate upon contact with other objects.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Color 8\n2. Framed Containers:\n   - Border Color: 3\n   - Attribute: Rectangular shape, sometimes fragmented/broken perimeter.\n   - Interior Colors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9\n3. Linear Beams:\n   - Colors: 1, 2, 4, 9\n   - Attribute: Vertical or horizontal lines spanning grid dimensions.\n</objects_summary>",

                "response": "### Identified object-to-object transformations (using colors 0\u20139)\n\n#### 1) Detect \u201cframed regions\u201d\n- Locate each region whose outline/border is color **3** and whose interior contains a solid block of a single non-**3**, non-**8** color **X** (examples show **X** in {**1,2,4,6,7,9**}).\n- Treat **8** as the background.\n\n#### 2) Find \u201copenings\u201d (missing border cells) on each frame\nFor each framed region:\n- Compute its bounding rectangle (min/max row/col covering the border **3** and interior **X**).\n- On the *perimeter* of this rectangle, identify cells that are **8** where a border cell would normally be (i.e., holes/gaps in the **3** border).  \n  These are the frame\u2019s \u201copenings\u201d.\n\n#### 3) Fill openings with the frame\u2019s interior color\n- Every opening cell (perimeter cell that is **8**) is recolored to **X** in the output.\n\n#### 4) Shoot \u201cbeams\u201d (straight-line extensions) from each filled opening\nFrom each filled opening cell of a frame with interior color **X**:\n- Determine a direction pointing outward from the frame. Observed direction rule that fits many cases:\n  - Use the vector from the nearest interior **X** cell to the opening cell (this yields one of the 8 compass directions).\n  - This produces:\n    - Horizontal beams (E/W) for left/right edge openings\n    - Vertical beams (N/S) for top/bottom edge openings\n    - Diagonal beams (NE/NW/SE/SW) for corner-type openings\n- Extend a straight line of color **X** from the opening outward through background **8**.\n\n#### 5) Beam stopping / blocking behavior\nBeams do **not** freely overwrite everything:\n- A beam continues through cells that are **8**.\n- The beam stops when:\n  - it reaches the grid boundary, **or**\n  - the next cell in its path is not **8** (examples show stopping at existing **3** borders, interior blocks, and/or other colored beams).\n- The blocking cell itself typically remains unchanged (beam stops before it or does not overwrite it).\n\n#### 6) Multiple frames and overlapping beams\nWhen multiple framed regions exist:\n- Apply the opening-fill + beam-extension process to each frame.\n- Beams from different frames can approach each other; observed outputs suggest interaction via blocking/termination rather than free overwriting.\n- Where potential overlaps could occur, one plausible behavior (consistent with several outputs) is:\n  - the earlier-present non-**8** cell (frame border **3**, interior **X**, or an already-drawn beam) prevents further extension of the incoming beam.\n\n#### 7) Possible secondary/compound beam behavior (turn/continuation)\nIn some outputs, beams appear to:\n- Extend straight from an opening, **then**\n- Continue from (or near) the far end of that straight segment into a diagonal direction (a \u201cturn\u201d / \u201celbow\u201d effect).\n\nThis can be interpreted in (at least) two plausible ways:\n- **A)** A beam \u201cdeflects\u201d when it is prevented from continuing straight (e.g., due to nearby/impending collision), producing a diagonal continuation.\n- **B)** The endpoint of a straight beam becomes a new \u201csource\u201d that spawns a secondary diagonal beam of the same color **X**.\n\n(Examples show patterns consistent with such chained extension for colors like **2** and **6**.)\n\n#### 8) Preservation of original objects\n- Existing frame borders (**3**) and interior blocks (**X**) remain in place (no translation/rotation observed).\n- Background **8** remains unchanged except where openings are filled or beams are drawn.\n\n---\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1) Find each 3-bordered frame and its interior color X (X \u2208 {1,2,4,6,7,9}).  \n2) On each frame\u2019s bounding-rectangle perimeter, any 8 \u201cgap\u201d in the 3 border is an opening.  \n3) Recolor each opening from 8 \u2192 X.  \n4) From each filled opening, draw a straight beam of color X outward (N/S/E/W or diagonal based on direction from nearest interior X to the opening), painting only 8 cells.  \n5) Stop beams at the grid edge or before/at the first non-8 cell (3 borders, other objects, other beams).  \n6) With multiple frames, beams can block each other.  \n7) In some cases a beam may also continue/turn diagonally from its endpoint (possible chained/deflected extension).  \n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n- Background: Color 8\n- Framed Regions: Border color 3, Inner colors {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}\n- Lines/Beams: Colors {1, 2, 4, 9}\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1) Find each 3-bordered frame and its interior color X (X \u2208 {1,2,4,6,7,9}).  \n2) On each frame\u2019s bounding-rectangle perimeter, any 8 \u201cgap\u201d in the 3 border is an opening.  \n3) Recolor each opening from 8 \u2192 X.  \n4) From each filled opening, draw a straight beam of color X outward (N/S/E/W or diagonal based on direction from nearest interior X to the opening), painting only 8 cells.  \n5) Stop beams at the grid edge or before/at the first non-8 cell (3 borders, other objects, other beams).  \n6) With multiple frames, beams can block each other.  \n7) In some cases a beam may also continue/turn diagonally from its endpoint (possible chained/deflected extension).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
