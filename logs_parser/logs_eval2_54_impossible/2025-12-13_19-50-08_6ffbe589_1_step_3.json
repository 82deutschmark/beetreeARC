        "Full raw LLM response": "**Test Input Analysis and Algorithm Design**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to handle an ARC task. I've got to figure out a transformation from an input grid to an output grid using example inputs. I'm seeing patterns - it looks like a block, potentially with noise and the output might be the clean version. I need to infer the transformation algorithm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dimensions. Is the output a crop of the input? Let me try to analyze the first example.  The input seems to have a large object, perhaps with some \"noise\" pixels around it. The output looks similar but cropped and cleaned up, maybe even symmetric! This is crucial. I check the pixels and try to define a bounding box for the object. The \"noise\" is often present in the non-zero pixels. I can check the coordinates to extract subgrids. It might be a combination of cropping, cleaning up noise, shifting/rotating, or symmetry.\n\nThe second example is the key. The output is like a transformation of an object from the input. It might be a shift or a horizontal flip. I look for symmetric patterns, perhaps finding a center, but it's hard to make conclusive claims with a casual examination. I start defining the pixels for the block. It appears a frame is also involved.\n\nI consider rotations and flips, as those are common in ARC problems. I look for how an object can be mapped. I look at each row and see if the pixels shift in the output. I also look at if the output is just a mirrored pattern.\nThe third example looks at a frame-like object and if shifts are involved. I start looking at the 10x10 block in the input and compare it to the output. I can't quite identify an algorithm. I keep checking the patterns and start considering that pixels outside the main object are the key, to see if those pixel locations match the transformation.\nI can look for the object's boundaries and then apply the logic from the given pixels.\nI also examine if the input is a combination of different smaller pieces. It's a sort of visual arithmetic that I need to decode.\nI can look at these input examples. A common theme is a shift. If that's the case, these are used and not a direct copy. The shift occurs between rows of the input grid. I can define a specific rotation.\n\nI hypothesize that the user wants a clean, reconstructed version. The problem is a kind of jigsaw puzzle, assembling valid rows. I then need to construct the grid from these parts. The noise is probably important. I start looking for how the rows map. Are the pixel values transformed (e.g. 1 becomes 0?\nDoes the solution combine the valid rows from the input and \"repair\" the corrupted rows?\n\nI identify the main features in the Test Input, which has a 13x13 block. Then I construct the final grid based on the given logic and inferred symmetry.\nI can verify this by checking if the inferred noise rows also match the intended ones. I use symmetry to create the main pattern, filling the main objects and the outer frame, making sure the pixels match the ones from the noisy grid. I'll need to do some coordinate calculations.\n\nI have a plan to reconstruct the output from valid row components. And I know it's a symmetric shape with a 13x13 center.\nI need to put a solution together and then carefully check that all pixel values make sense!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the test input grid based on the logic inferred from three solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** The input contains a large, roughly 13x13 object that is somewhat noisy and asymmetric. The output is a 13x13 grid containing a \"clean,\" perfectly symmetric version of that object. The transformation involves cropping the main shape and repairing its symmetry (e.g., matching the left and right sides, fixing broken lines).\n2.  **Example 2:** The input contains a 10x10 block and scattered \"noise\" pixels outside it. The output is a 10x10 grid. The output rows correspond to the input block rows, but repaired and oriented correctly (some input rows were flipped or broken). The \"noise\" pixels appear to hint at the correct content for specific rows or are fragments of the correct rows.\n3.  **Example 3:** Similar to Example 2, the input contains a block and noise. The output is a reconstructed version of the block where rows are aligned and patterns are completed (e.g., the checkerboard frame of 4s is aligned, internal 1s and 2s are centered).\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\nThe test input is a 20x20 grid containing a main block of data roughly in the middle (rows 10-14) and various \"noise\" or fragments above and below it.\n-   **Main Block (Rows 10-14, Cols 7-19):**\n    -   Row 10: `5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5` (Width 13).\n    -   Row 11: `0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5` (Broken/Shifted).\n    -   Row 12: `5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5` (Symmetric, looks like the center).\n    -   Row 13: `0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5` (Identical to R11).\n    -   Row 14: `5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5` (Identical to R10).\n-   **Fragments:**\n    -   Row 6: `5,5,5`.\n    -   Row 7: `5,5,5,5,5`.\n    -   Row 9: `3,3`.\n    -   Row 17: `5,0,5,0,5`.\n    -   Row 18: `5,0,5`.\n    -   Row 2: `0,3,3,0,5`.\n    -   Row 1: `5` and `4`.\n\n**Logic:**\nThe task is to assemble a single coherent, vertically and horizontally symmetric 13x13 sprite (resembling a \"Space Invader\" or spaceship) from these parts.\n-   **Center Row (R6 of output):** Corresponds to Input Row 12 (`5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5`). It is already symmetric.\n-   **Rows R4/R8 of output:** Correspond to Input Row 10/14 (`5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5`). Already symmetric.\n-   **Rows R5/R7 of output:** Correspond to Input Row 11/13. These are broken in the input (`...3...3,3...5,5`). Based on the surrounding rows (transition from solid 3s in R4 to separated 3s in R6), and symmetry requirements, these rows should be repaired to `5,5,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5`.\n-   **Rows R3/R9 of output:** Input R9 has `3,3` in the center. Input R2 has `0,3,3,0,5`. Input R15 is empty. To maintain the shape's curve (narrowing from R4 to R2), and using the `3,3` hint, we construct `0,0,0,5,0,3,3,3,0,5,0,0,0`. (Using `3,3,3` to ensure symmetry on the odd-width grid).\n-   **Rows R2/R10 of output:** Input R1 has `5` and `4`. Input R17 has `5,0,5,0,5`. Based on the \"noise\" in R1 (`5` at col 4, `4` at col 7), we reconstruct a symmetric row `0,0,0,0,5,4,0,4,5,0,0,0,0`.\n-   **Rows R1/R11 of output:** Input R7 is `5,5,5,5,5`. Input R17 is `5,0,5,0,5`. The solid version `5,5,5,5,5` is likely correct. Output: `0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0`.\n-   **Rows R0/R12 of output:** Input R6 is `5,5,5`. Input R18 is `5,0,5`. The solid version `5,5,5` is likely correct. Output: `0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0`.\n\n**Reconstructed Grid (13x13):**\n0: `0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0`\n1: `0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0`\n2: `0,0,0,0,5,4,0,4,5,0,0,0,0`\n3: `0,0,0,5,0,3,3,3,0,5,0,0,0`\n4: `5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5`\n5: `5,5,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5`\n6: `5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5`\n7: `5,5,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5`\n8: `5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5`\n9: `0,0,0,5,0,3,3,3,0,5,0,0,0`\n10: `0,0,0,0,5,4,0,4,5,0,0,0,0`\n11: `0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0`\n12: `0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,5,4,0,4,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,5,0,3,3,3,0,5,0,0,0\n5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5\n5,5,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5\n5,5,0,3,3,0,4,0,3,3,0,5,5\n5,5,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,5,5\n5,5,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,5,5\n0,0,0,5,0,3,3,3,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,5,4,0,4,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Shape Reconstruction from Shifted Fragments**\n\nMy task is to solve an ARC puzzle involving image reconstruction from input examples.  The core idea I've discovered involves analyzing the relationships between input and output images to figure out the underlying transformation. My strategy is to use the examples as a guide to uncover the process. I am a master of image and pattern interpretation and I understand that the key lies in identifying how the input and the solution are related.\n\nFirst, I examined an example with a single object and looked for a relationship between its input size, output size, and the image content.  I identified what seems to be the \"main\" object or \"signal\" from a background of zeroes in the input, which suggests the shape is isolated and may be the focus.  This led me to the concept of **crop** operations on the non-background region but the output and input seemed inconsistent.  I determined that a simple crop was not enough.  I then explored the idea of **horizontal mirroring** or rotations, but these, too, failed to explain the transformation. I then considered symmetry as a key component, so I attempted to find an object's center of symmetry in a given input. This was more complex because the inputs are not always symmetric.\n\nThen, I shifted my focus to analyze the composition of the input. I believed the input images could be fragmented versions of the output. I also realized that the multiple images in the input might be shifted copies of the desired image. I started checking, specifically how the input was built from repeating parts that were possibly shifted or layered upon one another. This led me to a crucial discovery: the input consists of shifted or partially masked versions of the output, which should be able to reconstruct the pattern given the input samples. This explained why it was so difficult to correlate the output directly. This discovery helped me understand how I should approach the problem.\n\nI then considered the idea of **overlaying** all the information in the input (essentially ignoring the zeros). I noted an inconsistent dimension between input and output that pointed me to a key idea: the size of the output is fixed by the largest object present. The key is now understanding the relationship of the shifted parts, since some parts may be completely blacked out.\n\nMy solution emerged: a core extraction and reconstruction process.  Here's my refined process:\n1.  **Object Extraction:** Find the main pattern (the \"object\").\n2.  **Symmetry Repair:** Using the central or symmetrical nature of the main object, reconstruct the missing or inconsistent parts of the central object.\n3.  **Horizontal Symmetry:** Create a symmetric copy of the extracted core object.\n\nBy focusing on reconstructing the core object, understanding the shifting and overlap patterns, and enforcing symmetry, I can solve this ARC puzzle. The focus is to determine the shifting and masking details and reconstruct a clean version of the image. The key realization is that the target pattern is built of slightly moved, and maybe not complete, versions of a symmetric pattern. I am confident I can handle the task, given this newfound understanding of the problem.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the problem asks to reconstruct a single object from a noisy input grid. The input grid (20x20) contains one or more partial or noisy copies of a symmetrical object. The goal is to:\n1.  **Identify the bounding box of the main object components.** In the examples, there is a consistent center axis of symmetry for the \"true\" object. Distractor pixels that do not align with this symmetry or form coherent shapes are ignored.\n2.  **Combine the components to form a complete object.** Pixels from different rows that align with the object's structure are included. In particular, the object in the test input spans from Row 6 to Row 18.\n3.  **Repair the symmetry.** The object is assumed to be perfectly symmetric horizontally. We merge the left and right sides of the extracted crop (Union operation: if a pixel is non-zero on one side, it is mirrored to the other).\n4.  **Produce the cropped output.** The output grid size corresponds to the dimensions of the reconstructed object.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n-   The main object is a \"spaceship\" or \"tower\" shape located roughly between Columns 7 and 19.\n-   The center of symmetry is **Column 13**.\n-   The vertical span of the object is **Row 6 to Row 18**.\n-   Rows 0-4 contain \"noise\" (a vertical line of 5s) that is far to the left (Col 4) and doesn't match the main symmetry, so it is ignored.\n-   We extract the 13x13 region (Rows 6-18, Cols 7-19).\n-   We apply horizontal symmetry around the center column (relative column 6, corresponding to input column 13). Empty rows within the shape (Row 8, Row 16) are preserved as empty.\n\n**Construction of the Output (13x13):**\n-   **Row 0 (Input 6):** `0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0` (Already symmetric)\n-   **Row 1 (Input 7):** `0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0` (Already symmetric)\n-   **Row 2 (Input 8):** Empty -> `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n-   **Row 3 (Input 9):** Input has `3,3` at 12,13.

        "Full raw LLM response": "### How to infer the rule from the examples\n\nEach input contains:\n1) **One main \u201cpicture\u201d** (a cluster of non\u2011zero cells) and  \n2) **Some stray non\u2011zero pixels elsewhere** (noise / instructions).\n\nFrom the solved examples, the transformation is:\n\n#### Step A \u2014 Extract the main object\n- Treat `0` as background.\n- Find the **largest connected component** of non\u2011zero cells (using **8\u2011connectivity**, so diagonals count).\n- Compute its **bounding box** and **crop** the grid to that rectangle.  \n  This cropped rectangle is the base of the output.\n\n#### Step B \u2014 Use outside pixels as \u201cmirror instructions\u201d\n- Look at **all non\u2011zero pixels outside** the cropped bounding box.\n- For each color `c` that appears outside:\n  - Compute how far that outside occurrence is from the cropped box:\n    - `dx` = horizontal gap to the box (0 if vertically aligned with it)\n    - `dy` = vertical gap to the box (0 if horizontally aligned with it)\n  - If `dx > dy`, then **mirror color `c` horizontally** inside the crop.\n  - If `dy > dx`, then **mirror color `c` vertically** inside the crop.\n- Mirroring is done by **moving** the pixels of that color inside the crop to their mirrored positions (not duplicating them). Other colors are left as-is unless they have their own instruction.\n\nThis exactly explains Example 2 (color `3` mirrors horizontally, color `4` mirrors vertically), and the other examples follow the same \u201ccrop main object + mirror instructed colors\u201d pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n#### 1) Crop the main object\nThe largest connected non\u2011zero component is the big `3`/`4` cluster in the middle.  \nIts bounding box is:\n\n- Rows **9 to 15**\n- Columns **10 to 16**\n\nSo the cropped 7\u00d77 grid is:\n\nRow9:  `[0,0,3,3,0,0,0]`  \nRow10: `[3,3,3,3,3,3,0]`  \nRow11: `[0,3,0,0,0,3,3]`  \nRow12: `[3,3,0,4,0,3,3]`  \nRow13: `[0,3,0,0,0,3,3]`  \nRow14: `[3,3,3,3,3,3,0]`  \nRow15: `[0,0,0,0,3,0,0]`\n\n#### 2) Determine mirror instructions from outside pixels\nOutside that crop, we have:\n- Color **3** (the two `3`s near the top-left)\n- Color **4** (a lone `4` near the top)\n\nCompute the relative gaps:\n- The outside `3`s are **much farther left than above**, so `dx > dy` \u21d2 **mirror color 3 horizontally**.\n- The outside `4` is **much farther above than left**, so `dy > dx` \u21d2 **mirror color 4 vertically**.\n\nBut the only `4` in the crop is exactly on the crop\u2019s vertical midline, so a vertical mirror leaves it in the same place. Net effect: **only the 3s change**, via a left-right mirror.\n\nMirroring color `3` horizontally in a 7-wide grid means column `c` moves to `6 - c`.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0  \n0,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n3,3,0,0,0,3,0  \n3,3,0,4,0,3,3  \n3,3,0,0,0,3,0  \n0,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n0,0,3,0,0,0,0",
