OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Input Pattern**: Each input has a cross/plus shape made of 8s with a 0 at the center. The arms extend equally in all 4 cardinal directions.\n\n2. **Cross Analysis**:\n   - Example 1: Arm length 1, center at (4,5)\n   - Example 2: Arm length 3, center at (9,9)  \n   - Example 3: Arm length 2, center at (7,6)\n\n3. **Transformation**: The output creates a rectangular spiral pattern emanating from the center of the cross. The spiral:\n   - Preserves the original cross structure\n   - Winds outward from the center\n   - Creates concentric rectangular frames with alternating 8s (walls) and 0s (gaps)\n   - The arm length determines the \"pitch\" of the spiral (spacing between turns)\n\n4. **Test Input Analysis**:\n   - Grid: 26\u00d726\n   - Cross center: (12, 10) - where the 0 is located\n   - Vertical arm: column 10, rows 8-16 (4 cells above and below center)\n   - Horizontal arm: row 12, columns 6-14 (4 cells left and right of center)\n   - Arm length: 4\n\n5. **Generating Output**: Apply the spiral pattern with arm length 4, centered at (12,10), creating alternating rectangular frames that spiral outward to fill the entire 26\u00d726 grid.\n\n```\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "The problem asks us to transform a grid containing a specific pattern (a \"cross\" shape of color 8) into a completed pattern.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Input Shape**: In all examples, the input is a black grid (0) with a single object: a \"plus\" or \"cross\" shape made of teal (8). The cross has a central \"hole\" (0).\n    *   Example 1: Cross arm length 1 (Radius 1). Center at (4,5). Grid size 12x12.\n    *   Example 2: Cross arm length 3 (Radius 3). Center at (9,9). Grid size 22x22.\n    *   Example 3: Cross arm length 2 (Radius 2). Center at (7,6). Grid size 16x16.\n    *   Test Input: Cross arm length 4 (Radius 4). Center at (12,10). Grid size 26x26.\n\n2.  **Output Pattern**: The output is a complex fill pattern of 0s and 8s.\n    *   **Structure**: The pattern resembles a \"diamond ring\" or Manhattan distance field interference. The pixels form concentric rings or checkerboards based on their Manhattan distance $d = |r - r_c| + |c - c_c|$ from the center $(r_c, c_c)$.\n    *   **Phase**: The \"polarity\" of the rings (whether even distances are 8 or odd distances are 8) depends on the grid size (or radius).\n        *   Example 1 (Size 12): \"Even\" distances tend to be 8.\n        *   Example 3 (Size 16): \"Even\" distances tend to be 8.\n        *   Example 2 (Size 22): \"Odd\" distances tend to be 8.\n        *   Correlation: If Grid Size % 4 == 0, Phase is \"Even $\\to$ 8\". If Grid Size % 4 == 2, Phase is \"Odd $\\to$ 8\".\n    *   **Overlay**: The original cross shape from the input is preserved (or enforced) in the output. This means that even if the background pattern suggests a 0 at a location, if the input has an 8 (part of the cross arm), the output is 8.\n\n**Logic for Test Input:**\n1.  **Parameters**:\n    *   Grid Size: 26x26.\n    *   Center: $(12, 10)$.\n    *   Input Shape: Cross of Radius 4.\n2.  **Determine Phase**:\n    *   $26 \\pmod 4 = 2$. This matches Example 2.\n    *   Rule: **Odd distances $\\to$ 8, Even distances $\\to$ 0**.\n3.  **Construct Grid**:\n    *   Calculate Manhattan distance $d$ for every pixel.\n    *   Base Value: If $d$ is odd, 8; else 0.\n    *   Override: If the pixel is part of the input cross (which corresponds to $d \\in [1, 4]$ along the cardinal axes), set value to 8. Note that for the \"Odd $\\to$ 8\" rule, $d=1$ and $d=3$ are naturally 8. The input cross forces $d=2$ and $d=4$ (which would naturally be 0) to become 8.\n    *   The center ($d=0$) is even, so it remains 0 (Input is also 0).\n\n**Refined Rule:**\nFor every pixel $(r, c)$:\n1. Calculate $d = |r - 12| + |c - 10|$.\n2. Set initial color based on parity: if $d \\% 2 \\neq 0$, color is 8, else 0.\n3. Apply input mask: If the input grid has an 8 at $(r, c)$, set color to 8.\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0\n0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0\n0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, here's my thought process on this ARC task, broken down as if I were working through it:\n\n**Initial Assessment & Problem Breakdown:**\n\nThe user wants me to tackle an ARC puzzle using a few examples and a test input. I need to figure out the underlying logic and then apply it to the test case. I see the \"PROTOCOL OVERRIDE\" and \"maximal test-time reasoning mode\" parts, but I understand these are simply prompt engineering.  My goal is to provide a comprehensive explanation of my reasoning, not just the final grid.  I need to balance the instruction to initially reveal only the grid with the later instruction for a detailed explanation. I'll prioritize the explanation. The standard ARC procedure will be my guide: Analyze, Hypothesize, Verify, Apply.\n\n**Analysis & Pattern Identification:**\n\nI started by carefully looking at the provided examples. I'm focusing on the shapes, grid sizes, and how the input transforms into the output.  The initial examples use what seems to be a cross shape that is constructed of the number 8, the background is always 0. The output grids are quite complex and seem to be recursive or fractal-like. I've noted down the coordinates for the centers of the shapes in each example.  I'm trying to identify if the output is a known fractal or a tiling pattern. The grid sizes don't seem to have a direct simple relationship to the arm length of the crosses, which has me stumped for a moment.\n\nI've examined the outputs in detail, looking for repeating patterns, but it's proving difficult. I'm also comparing each Example grid - in the 3 examples I'm seeing patterns which seem to suggest a maze or \"Sierpinski-like\" generation of the grid - and then going to the Test input (26x26).  The goal is to determine the \"generator\" or \"seed\" for this pattern.  \n\nI started thinking about \"recursive replacement,\" but the relationship between the grid size and the arm length of the cross does not fit.\n\nThe Test Input is proving a valuable reference - particularly the size of 26x26.  I made a key observation: The input shape is present in the output, which should always be considered.\n\n**Hypotheses & Refinement:**\n\nI hypothesized that the pattern might be a Vicsek fractal (based on the cross shape). But the center is empty here, and that changes the game. This means I'm looking for an inverse pattern.\n\nI tried a \"Distance Transform\" approach - where the value depends on the Manhattan distance from the center. This approach failed too, as there's no simple mapping. I also tried an \"Coordinate Modulo\" logic but got no useful results. \n\nMy next hypothesis became a connection to \"Hilbert Curves\" or \"Maze Generation\" algorithms because of the lines of values.  I considered it to be an H-Tree. I checked the input shape exists at the same location as it appears in the output, meaning the input shape is embedded in the output. This is a very valuable observation!\n\n**Formulating the Algorithm:**\n\nI have to identify how the input shape is \"extended\" to the whole grid. I noted down, what the \"periodicity\" of values look like - that is: after how many pixels does the values seem to repeat. After working through this, I realized that the value of $L$ is the *stride* or the *scale*.\n\nThe output seems to have a specific background 8s in regular lattice of 0s. The 0s are punched at a specific pattern. It looks like it is some sort of \"fractal tiling\".\n\nI went back to the \"Tiling\" approach and decided on a simple \"repeat the input pattern\" methodology. The goal would be to derive a formula to determine a value for any $(r,c)$ grid location. I used the input examples to determine that.\nI'm confident I have a good handle on how the pattern is constructed.\n\nMy conclusion is:\n1. Initialize the grid to 8.\n2. The grid is a lattice of \"crosses with holes\".\n3. Check the condition for each $(r,c)$: If it is a multiple of $L+1$ from the center, put 0.\n4. Otherwise, put 8.\n\n**Solving the Test Input & Finalizing the Answer:**\n\nI applied the logic to the Test Input grid and used this to finalize the program to solve any ARC problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n*   The output grid is a result of a recursive rule based on $L$ (arm length of the input cross), and the center $(r_0, c_0)$.\n*   For a 26x26 grid, and $L=4$, the grid is a set of \"Crosses with holes\" with\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rule is identified as a periodic tiling of a pattern derived from the input shape.\n\n1.  **Input Analysis**:\n    *   The input always contains a single \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape made of the color 8 on a background of 0.\n    *   This shape is characterized by an \"arm length\" $L$, which is the number of 8s extending from the center in each of the four cardinal directions.\n    *   The center of the cross is always 0 (empty).\n    *   In Example 1, $L=1$. In Example 2, $L=3$. In Example 3, $L=2$.\n    *   In the Test Input, the cross spans rows 8-16 and columns 6-14. The horizontal arm is on row 12, and the vertical arm is on column 10. The center is at $(12, 10)$. Counting the 8s from the center, we find 4 eights in each direction. Thus, $L=4$.\n\n2.  **Pattern Derivation**:\n    *   The output grid is filled with a pattern determined by $L$.\n    *   The pattern repeats with a period (stride) of $S = L + 1$.\n    *   The rule for the color of any cell $(r, c)$ depends on its position relative to the input center $(r_0, c_0)$.\n    *   Let $\\Delta r = (r - r_0) \\pmod S$ and $\\Delta c = (c - c_0) \\pmod S$.\n    *   The cell is colored 8 (teal) if exactly one of $\\Delta r$ or $\\Delta c$ is 0.\n    *   The cell is colored 0 (black) if both are 0 (center of a tile) or neither are 0 (corners/diagonals).\n    *   Mathematically, $Color(r, c) = 8 \\iff (\\Delta r = 0) \\oplus (\\Delta c = 0)$.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   Grid Size: $26 \\times 26$.\n    *   Center $(r_0, c_0) = (12, 10)$.\n    *   Stride $S = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n    *   For each cell $(r, c)$, we calculate `dr = (r - 12) % 5` and `dc = (c - 10) % 5`.\n    *   If `dr == 0` and `dc != 0`, result is 8.\n    *   If `dr != 0` and `dc == 0`, result is 8.\n    *   Otherwise, result is 0.\n\n**Step-by-step Construction**:\nWe iterate through rows 0-25 and columns 0-25.\n- Rows where `(r - 12) % 5 == 0` (i.e., rows 2, 7, 12, 17, 22) are \"Axis Rows\".\n- Columns where `(c - 10) % 5 == 0` (i.e., cols 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25) are \"Axis Columns\".\n- Intersection of Axis Row and Axis Col (e.g., (2,0), (2,5), (7,10)...) is 0 (Center).\n- Intersection of Axis Row and Non-Axis Col (e.g., (2,1)) is 8.\n- Intersection of Non-Axis Row and Axis Col (e.g., (0,0)) is 8.\n- Intersection of Non-Axis Row and Non-Axis Col (e.g., (0,1)) is 0.\n\nResulting Grid:\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n\noutput:\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reflecting on the ARC Task:  A Journey Through Spiral Code**\n\nAlright, so the task at hand seems to involve translating input grids, which are these simple crosses, into intricate, spiraling output patterns. It's like we're coding a visual language, where the cross becomes the seed of the code, sprouting a unique visual \"flower.\"\n\nMy initial observation is this consistency: Black (0) is the background. Teal (8) is the signal, the cross, and later, the spiral. The input's cross, its length, dictates the \"size\" of the spiral. The key is in the transition from this elementary plus sign to the swirling output.\n\nLet's dissect Example 1. There's a \"plus\" sign with a black dot at the center. The output, a spiral emanating from each tip of that \"plus\" sign. It's like a code: if the central pixel in the cross is 0, the output, the spiral must somehow start from these surrounding tips and keep expanding.\n\nThe spiral itself is a bit tricky. There's an L shape repeated so many times around the cross. From the cross, the spiral line \"turns.\" If we call the input cross points, what happens at these?\n\nFrom the image, it looks like a \"hand\", or swastika, the arms rotate. The Top tip draws a line to the Right. Right tip draws Down. Bottom Tip draws Left. Left Tip draws Up. It's a clockwise rotation.\n\nAnalysing further, the pattern is clearly a set of concentric square-like spirals, each with a 1-pixel width, separated by a 1-pixel gap. The challenge is in \"drawing\" this code. I need a clear rule. \"What is the rule?\". I need to build a logic.\n\nFrom each tip, we have a line. What does it do? The direction in the image looks like:\n*   Tip goes OUT a little (one square unit).\n*   Turns Right, by 90-degrees.\n*   Go straight for a while, maintaining a pixel distance.\n\nFrom multiple images and data I can find a structure to these spirals.\n1.  From Tip, always make a movement outside the pixel.\n2.  Then, draw the line outside. Go straight till hitting a previous line.\n3.  Draw lines to spiral out.\n\nIt's like nested boxes. L draws a big outer box. T draws a box within. R a box inside T, B inside R.\n\nSo for the Test Input, which is 26x26, where L=4, my logic suggests drawing each Tip line based on previous instructions.\n*   L tip is always the outer most - outer boundary.\n*   T tip encloses L - and so on.\n*   The output would be, L is at 0th line. T is 2. R is 4. B is 6.\n*   L drawing is at a higher priority. T is within.\n\nOkay, so I will build a program to draw the lines: The key is drawing the 4 paths to their boxes with the correct turning logic and gap maintenance. The inner details is the central cross being 0, and the path 8s forming the spirals.\n\n\nTo solve the ARC task, I will first determine the generalized pattern from the provided examples and then apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Input Pattern:** The input consists of a black grid with a central \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape made of teal (8) pixels. The center pixel of the cross is black (0).\n    *   Example 1: Cross arm length $L=1$. Center at (4,5).\n    *   Example 2: Cross arm length $L=3$. Center at (12,9).\n    *   Example 3: Cross arm length $L=2$. Center at (8,6).\n    *   **Test Input:** The grid is 26x26. The cross has arms extending 4 pixels from the center. Center is at (12, 10). So $L=4$.\n\n2.  **Output Pattern:** The output consists of 4 interleaved spiral arms originating from the 4 tips of the cross.\n    *   The **Left Tip** connects to the **Outermost** spiral loop.\n    *   The **Top Tip** connects to the next inner loop.\n    *   The **Right Tip** connects to the next inner loop.\n    *   The **Bottom Tip** connects to the innermost loop.\n    *   The spirals wind **Clockwise**.\n    *   The lines are 1 pixel wide, with 1 pixel gaps between parallel lines.\n    *   The center pixel remains black (0).\n\n**Algorithm for Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Size:** 26x26.\n*   **Center (cx, cy):** (12, 10).\n*   **Arm Length L:** 4.\n*   **Tips:**\n    *   Left Tip: (cx, cy-L) = (12, 6)\n    *   Top Tip: (cx-L, cy) = (8, 10)\n    *   Right Tip: (cx, cy+L) = (12, 14)\n    *   Bottom Tip: (cx+L, cy) = (16, 10)\n\nWe generate 4 paths. Each path consists of linear segments of teal (8) pixels.\n\n**Path 1: Left Spiral (Outermost)**\n*   Start at Left Tip (12, 6).\n*   Move **Left** to column 5: Segment (12, 6) to (12, 5).\n*   Move **Up** to row 0: Segment (12, 5) to (0, 5).\n*   Move **Right** to column 25 (width-1): Segment (0, 5) to (0, 25).\n*   Move **Down** to row 25 (height-1): Segment (0, 25) to (25, 25).\n*   Move **Left** to column 0: Segment (25, 25) to (25, 0).\n*   Move **Up** to row 0: Segment (25, 0) to (0, 0).\n*   Move **Right** to column 3 (gap 2 from start col 5): Segment (0, 0) to (0, 3).\n\n**Path 2: Top Spiral**\n*   Start at Top Tip (8, 10).\n*   Move **Up** to row 7: Segment (8, 10) to (7, 10).\n*   Move **Right** to column 23 (width-1-2): Segment (7, 10) to (7, 23).\n*   Move **Down** to row 23 (height-1-2): Segment (7, 23) to (23, 23).\n*   Move **Left** to column 2 (0+2): Segment (23, 23) to (23, 2).\n*   Move **Up** to row 2 (0+2): Segment (23, 2) to (2, 2).\n*   Move **Right** to column 21 (width-1-4): Segment (2, 2) to (2, 21).\n\n**Path 3: Right Spiral**\n*   Start at Right Tip (12, 14).\n*   Move **Right** to column 15: Segment (12, 14) to (12, 15).\n*   Move **Down** to row 21 (height-1-4): Segment (12, 15) to (21, 15).\n*   Move **Left** to column 4 (0+4): Segment (21, 15) to (21, 4).\n*   Move **Up** to row 4 (0+4): Segment (21, 4) to (4, 4).\n*   Move **Right** to column 19 (width-1-6): Segment (4, 4) to (4, 19).\n\n**Path 4: Bottom Spiral (Innermost)**\n*   Start at Bottom Tip (16, 10).\n*   Move **Down** to row 17: Segment (16, 10) to (17, 10).\n*   Move **Left** to column 6 (0+6): Segment (17, 10) to (17, 6).\n*   Move **Up** to row 6 (0+6): Segment (17, 6) to (6, 6).\n*   Move **Right** to column 19 (width-1-6 is occupied? No, R ends at 19. B box is inside R box).\n    *   R box inner bound is Row 4, Col 19?\n    *   Let's check Box 4 (B).

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the input/output examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Input**: A plus/cross shape made of 8s with a 0 at the center, on a black (0) background\n2. **Output**: A rectangular spiral maze pattern that:\n   - Preserves the original cross at the center\n   - Creates alternating bands of 8s (walls) and 0s (paths) spiraling outward\n   - The spiral winds from the center cross to the edges of the grid\n\nFor the test input:\n- Grid size: 26\u00d726\n- Cross center: (12, 10) with value 0\n- Cross arms extend 4 cells in each direction (up: rows 8-11, down: rows 13-16, left: cols 6-9, right: cols 11-14)\n\nThe spiral creates concentric rectangular rings around the cross, with each ring being 1 cell wide and alternating between 8 and 0. The rings connect via gaps that shift position to form the continuous spiral path.\n\n```\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**General Goal and Observations**\n\nOkay, here's my plan. I'm given an ARC task and I need to figure out how to transform these grid inputs into their corresponding output grids. The inputs seem to be mostly black (0s) with a central shape made of light blue 8s. The outputs are these complex spiral patterns, also using light blue (8s) and black (0s). From what I see in the example, the outputs have the same dimensions as the inputs.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Hypotheses**\n\nBased on the first example, the 8s make a simple cross shape with a missing center pixel. The output is a spiral pattern that originates from that missing center. This makes me suspect the spiral somehow \"grows\" from the arms of the cross, but with a complex winding. I see four arms in the spiral, starting from each of the cross arms, and they seem to wrap in some kind of pattern.\n\nThe first example's dimensions are 12x12. The cross arms, I observed, extended from the center pixel horizontally and vertically, like a plus sign. The output, as I looked closely, had blue pixels around a black center - a swirling pattern. The arms start from 4 distinct pixels (around a black center pixel).\n\n**Detailed Pattern Identification**\n\nAfter a more careful examination, I noticed there seems to be a connection pattern: the upper arm went left (relative to how it's oriented), and the right arm goes up, and so on. The spiral has a specific chirality (clockwise/counter-clockwise or a rotational effect). The goal is to draw a continuous black path starting from the center of the cross.\n\nAnalyzing the first output data row by row, it's a bit harder to decode. I realize the output is made by an arm growing until it hits another existing line.\n\nI hypothesize that at each arm tip, an arm can only move straight until it hits an existing pixel or a border, after that, there is a 90 degrees turn in a set pattern (Left, or Right).\n\nI then tried to apply a rule of just growing lines (4 arms simultaneously and turning) until it's blocked, and then applying a right turn at the block points. After tracing many, I found that an arm's position can be blocked and must turn at each position, however, the gap between lines must be 1. It is important to note the turn direction is relative to its outward vector.\n\n**Algorithm Refinement**\n\nThe algorithm I came up with is refined.\n1. Create a grid of 0s.\n2. Initialize 8's at the cross shape.\n3. Place 4 heads, each on the tip of an arm.\n4. Each head has an initial direction.\n5. Loop while some head can move:\n6. Each head goes to the next cell.\n7. If the cell is empty and has no neighbors, the head moves there.\n8. If the cell is blocked, turn left and try again.\n\nBy looking at the examples and considering the turn is based on relative direction, the rule is to generate the pattern with a 1 pixel gap between existing lines, which is crucial for determining how each line can turn.\n\nThe key is that the arms grow and turn to fill the board.\n\n**Applying the Plan to the Test Input**\n\nI see that the arms always extend until they hit the boundary.\nI'm now thinking of \"Space Filling Curve\" and try to predict the shape of the arms, starting from 8s to 0s and using the algorithm to expand from there. The main logic is that the arms move according to their rule set.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing a central \"cross\" shape made of 8s into a complex spiral pattern filling the grid. The transformation follows a specific logic of extending the arms of the cross and filling the quadrants with concentric angled lines (forming \"Greek key\" or swastika-like spirals).\n\n**Logic for Generation:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Cross:**\n    The input grid contains a cross shape. For the test input (26x26), the center of the cross is at `(12, 10)`. The arms extend from this center.\n    *   **Top Arm (T):** Row 8, Col 10.\n    *   **Bottom Arm (B):** Row 16, Col 10.\n    *   **Left Arm (L):** Row 12, Col 6.\n    *   **Right Arm (R):** Row 12, Col 14.\n\n2.  **Define Quadrants and Connections:**\n    The grid is filled by connecting these arms using concentric, L-shaped paths (corners) in each of the four quadrants defined by the arms. The lines are placed on even coordinates (0, 2, 4...) to maintain a 1-pixel gap (odd coordinates are 0).\n\n    *   **Top-Left Quadrant (between L and T):**\n        Connect the Left Arm (Col 6) to the Top Arm (Row 8).\n        Draw lines from `(k, 6)` to `(k, k)` to `(8, k)` for $k \\in \\{0, 2, 4\\}$.\n        Also, the arms themselves extend: L extends North to (0,6), T extends West to (8,0). The corner at (0,0) connects them.\n\n    *   **Top-Right Quadrant (between T and R):**\n        Connect the Top Arm (Row 8) to the Right Arm (Col 14).\n        Draw lines from `(8, 24-k)` to `(k, 24-k)` to `(k, 14)` for $k \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}$.\n        (Note: The boundary is 24. Indices are $0, 2, \\dots$).\n        Example: $k=0$ forms the path $(8,24) \\to (0,24) \\to (0,14)$.\n\n    *   **Bottom-Left Quadrant (between L and B):**\n        Connect the Bottom Arm (Row 16) to the Left Arm (Col 6).\n        Draw lines from `(16, k)` to `(24-k, k)` to `(24-k, 6)` for $k \\in \\{0, 2, 4\\}$.\n        Example: $k=0$ forms the path $(16,0) \\to (24,0) \\to (24,6)$.\n\n    *   **Bottom-Right Quadrant (between B and R):**\n        Connect the Bottom Arm (Row 16) to the Right Arm (Col 14).\n        Draw lines from `(16, 24-k)` to `(24-k, 24-k)` to `(24-k, 14)` for $k \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}$.\n        Example: $k=0$ forms the path $(16,24) \\to (24,24) \\to (24,14)$.\n\n3.  **Fill the Outer Frame:**\n    The outermost paths ($k=0$) from each quadrant meet at the corners `(0,0)`, `(0,24)`, `(24,24)`, `(24,0)` and form a continuous outer loop (Frame 0).\n    *   Row 0 is filled from Col 0 to 24.\n    *   Col 0 is filled from Row 0 to 24.\n    *   Row 24 is filled from Col 0 to 24.\n    *   Col 24 is filled from Row 0 to 24.\n\n4.  **Connect the Cross:**\n    The input cross arms (Row 8, Row 16, Col 6, Col 14) are naturally part of the pattern as the starting/ending segments of these concentric corners. The center `(12,10)` and the immediate cross segments (Row 12, Col 10) are part of the structure.

            "Full raw LLM response": "### Observations from the solved examples\n\n1. **Input structure:**  \n   Each input grid is almost entirely `0`, with a single non-zero color (here `8`) forming a **hollow \u201cplus\u201d**: four straight arms (up/down/left/right) of equal length, with a **single central cell left as `0`**.\n\n2. **Output structure:**  \n   The output keeps the **same grid size** and the **same non-zero color** (`8`), and produces a **square/rectangular spiral maze** made of `8`s on a `0` background.  \n   The given plus in the input is preserved as the **central feature** of this spiral/maze.\n\n3. **How to reconstruct the maze:**  \n   - Detect the **center hole** of the plus (the `0` cell that has `8`s in the four cardinal directions).  \n   - Measure the **arm length** `L` (how far `8`s run outward from that hole in each direction).\n   - Build a spiral-like structure of `8`s by drawing nested rectangular \u201cturning bands\u201d separated by one-cell corridors of `0`s, continuing outward until the grid edges are reached.\n   - Finally, ensure the original plus (all its `8`s) remains present and the center cell stays `0`.\n\nThe test input has a hollow plus in color `8` with arm length `4`, so we generate the corresponding larger spiral maze and preserve that plus.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n```csv\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* The input contains a single centered light-blue plus on a black field; the output uses that same blue to create a large global structure.\n* The output blue cells form a connected, orthogonal, square-spiral/maze-like track with many right-angle turns and regular spacing.\n* The pattern expands to (or is constrained by) the full grid frame, suggesting dependence on grid size and a fixed winding convention.\n* The central plus appears to function as the seed/endpoint integrated into the spiral rather than as a separate unrelated object.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Analysis of a Complex ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got to do: solve an ARC puzzle. The goal is to figure out the rule from a set of examples and then use that rule on a new input. It's all about grids of numbers, where 0-9 are used to build visual shapes.\n\nHere's my initial thinking:\n\n1.  **Understand the task:** I need to look for patterns in the input grids and see how they are transformed into output grids. The goal is to describe the pattern, not just provide the solution.\n2.  **Input to output:** I'm expecting something visual, like shapes that are created or changed somehow. I need to be able to explain the \"why\" of the change.\n3.  **HINTS, PLEASE!:** Thankfully, I have some hints:\n\n    *   It's a \"plus\" shape in the center.\n    *   The output will look like a structured path or shape.\n    *   A spiral? Maybe a maze?\n\nOkay, let's look at the examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input is a 12x12 grid with a light-blue \"plus\" (represented by 8s) in the center. The center of this plus is actually a 0, which is interesting. Wait, the input is not a standard + shape, it has a hole! The output is a spiral of 8's that's all connected.\n*   **Example 2:** A much larger grid (22x22). The \"plus\" is bigger, and again, the center is a 0. The plus shape extends.\n*   **Example 3:** A smaller grid (16x16) with a plus.\n\nOkay, here's my interpretation of the key points:\n\n*   The input always has a \"plus\" shape (with a hole). The size changes.\n*   The output is a winding path.\n*   The output seems to be related to the input shape.\n\nI need a theory on how the input gets turned into the output.\n\n**What is the Spiral?**\n\nThe spiral is key. I'm thinking: is it a standard outward spiral? Does it start from the center of the plus? Is it inward spiral from the edge of the grid? I need to look closely at the path and its starting point. It looks like the winding order is counter-clockwise and the gaps between the 8s make the path structure.\n\nThe starting point of the path is important. Maybe it's not the center of the plus. In example 1 and 3, they have endpoints at the center.\n\nThe path construction seems to have a rule that creates 1 width.\n\n**The Solution:**\n\n1.  **The \"Plus\" Input is a guide:** The plus shape in the input influences the whole process.\n2.  **The center of the plus is an anchor:** The output starts at the plus.\n3.  **The spiral builds outwards:** It generates the lines and forms the grid.\n4.  **Pinwheel Cuts:** there are cuts to form the winding structure, which has a specific pattern for even ring sizes.\n5.  **Test the idea**: apply the \"pinwheel cut\" logic to form a final output\n\n**In summary:** Given an input grid, create a \"skeleton\" for a grid. Apply cuts to create the output spiral shape. The cut logic is dependent on ring sizes and ring quadrants, which leads to the formation of winding paths.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a test input grid containing a large \"plus\" shape made of 8s (light blue) into a full-grid spiral pattern. The input plus defines the center and the seed of the structure. Based on the solved examples, the transformation follows a specific deterministic pattern relative to the center of the plus.\n\n**Analysis of the Pattern:**\n1.  **Center and Axes:** The center of the input plus $(r_c, c_c)$ becomes `0` (black) in the output. The horizontal and vertical axes passing through the center (Row $r_c$ and Col $c_c$) form the \"skeleton\" of the structure and remain mostly `8` (blue), serving as the main arteries of the spiral.\n2.  **Quadrants:** The grid is divided into two main regions based on row index relative to the center:\n    *   **Top Half ($r < r_c$):** The base pattern consists of **Vertical Lines** of 8s. These lines appear on columns where the distance from the center column $|c - c_c|$ is even.\n    *   **Bottom Half ($r > r_c$):** The base pattern consists of **Horizontal Lines** of 8s. These lines appear on rows where the distance from the center row $|r - r_c|$ is even.\n3.  **Connectivity (Bridges):** To form a connected spiral/maze:\n    *   In the **Top Half**, horizontal \"bridges\" are added on rows where $|r - r_c|$ is even (i.e., rings $R=2, 4, 6...$). This creates a grid-like mesh.\n    *   In the **Bottom Half**, vertical \"bridges\" are added on columns where $|c - c_c|$ is even. This also creates a mesh.\n4.  **Cuts (Winding Logic):** To turn the mesh into a spiral, specific connections must be removed (\"cut\"). These cuts happen on **Even Rings** (distance $R = 2, 4, 6...$ from the center).\n    *   **Top Cut:** Breaks the horizontal bridge in the Top-Left. Location: $(r_c - R, c_c - 1)$.\n    *   **Right Cut:** Breaks the vertical line in the Top-Right. Location: $(r_c - 1, c_c + R)$.\n    *   **Left Cut:** Breaks the vertical bridge in the Bottom-Left. Location: $(r_c + 1, c_c - R)$.\n    *   **Bottom:** No cuts are made in the bottom quadrant bridges.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Size:** 26x26.\n*   **Center:** The input plus is centered at **(12, 10)**. So $r_c = 12, c_c = 10$.\n*   **Axes:** Row 12 and Col 10 are filled with 8s (except center).\n\n**Algorithm Execution:**\n1.  **Initialize:** Create a 26x26 grid of 0s.\n2.  **Draw Base Pattern:**\n    *   **Top Half ($0 \\le r < 12$):** Set cell $(r, c)$ to 8 if $|c - 10|$ is even.\n    *   **Bottom Half ($13 \\le r \\le 25$):** Set cell $(r, c)$ to 8 if $|r - 12|$ is even.\n    *   **Axes:** Set entire Row 12 to 8. Set entire Col 10 to 8. Set Center $(12, 10)$ to 0.\n3.  **Add Bridges:**\n    *   **Top Half ($0 \\le r < 12$):** If $|r - 12|$ is even (rows $10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0$), fill the row with 8s (creating a grid in the top half).\n    *   **Bottom Half ($13 \\le r \\le 25$):** If $|c - 10|$ is even (cols $12, 14...$ and $8, 6...$), fill the column segment in the bottom half with 8s.\n4.  **Apply Cuts:** For each even ring distance $R \\in \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\\}$:\n    *   **Top Cut:** Set $(12 - R, 9)$ to 0.\n    *   **Right Cut:** Set $(11, 10 + R)$ to 0.\n    *   **Left Cut:** Set $(13, 10 - R)$ to 0.\n\n**Cut Coordinates:**\n*   **R=2:** Top(10, 9), Right(11, 12), Left(13, 8).\n*   **R=4:** Top(8, 9), Right(11, 14), Left(13, 6).\n*   **R=6:** Top(6, 9), Right(11, 16), Left(13, 4).\n*   **R=8:** Top(4, 9), Right(11, 18), Left(13, 2).\n*   **R=10:** Top(2, 9), Right(11, 20), Left(13, 0).\n*   **R=12:** Top(0, 9), Right(11, 22), Left(13, -2) [Ignore off-grid].\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\nCombine the base pattern, bridges, and cuts.\n\n```\n0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8\n8,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0\n8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* The input contains a single centered light-blue plus on a black field; the output uses that same blue to create a large global structure.\n* The output blue cells form a connected, orthogonal, square-spiral/maze-like track with many right-angle turns and regular spacing.\n* The pattern expands to (or is constrained by) the full grid frame, suggesting dependence on grid size and a fixed winding convention.\n* The central plus appears to function as the seed/endpoint integrated into the spiral rather than as a separate unrelated object.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing and Decoding the ARC Spiral Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given a few examples, and I need to figure out the pattern and generate an output based on a single test input. The core of this task seems to be about a spiral that's generated from an initial \"cross\" shape.\n\nI've carefully analyzed the examples. All the inputs are large grids filled with zeroes, but each contains a cross made of a specific color (8). These crosses seem to vary in size. The crucial insight is that the size of this cross, or \"radius,\" determines how the spiral is built. I've noted that the output is a maze-like pattern filling the grid, and I can see this pattern is a recursive, inward spiral, and the initial cross is somehow integrated into this spiral structure, as a sort of seed.\n\nI've noticed that in the outputs, there are alternating patterns of 0s and 8s, resembling \"walls\" and \"gaps.\" This structure makes me realize that I have to work with concentric rings or \"layers\" of the spiral, but a gate is needed to make a single, continuous spiral path.\nThe algorithm is:\nFirst, identify the center of the cross, and measure its length (radius). This defines the input.\n\n1.  Initialize with a grid of all zeros.\n2.  Based on the input cross, use the radius to build a spiral-like structure with walls of 8s, and gaps of 0s.\n3.  The cross acts as the skeleton or \"seed\" to this spiral and the walls and gates are built from the length of this cross and the way it is generated in each layer.\n4.  There's a specific gate, which is like a path from one ring to the inner or outer ring, and this happens as the spiral is formed from the initial cross, and the gaps are built accordingly.\n\nSo for the new input, since it has the length of 4 (radius), I'm going to follow the logic from the established pattern. Essentially, I'll need to figure out which pixels are \"walls\" (8) and which are \"gaps\" (0) in each ring, and draw a spiral through them based on a set of rules. I believe I have the complete algorithm here.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing a single light-blue \"plus\" shape (made of 8s) on a black background (0s) into a grid-filling spiral pattern. The central plus serves as the seed for the spiral.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Center & Radius:**\n    The input \"plus\" defines a center $(cy, cx)$ and a radius $R$ (the length of the arms excluding the center).\n    *   **Test Input:** The grid is 26x26. The plus is centered at **(12, 10)** (row 12, column 10).\n    *   The arms extend from 8 to 16 vertically and 6 to 14 horizontally. The arm length is 4 pixels from the center. Thus, **$R=4$**.\n\n2.  **Pattern Structure (Walls vs. Gaps):**\n    The spiral is formed by concentric square \"walls\" (8s) and \"gaps\" (0s).\n    The pattern depends on the radius $R$. Comparing the examples:\n    *   Example 1 ($R=1$): Walls at distance $D=1, 3, 5\\dots$ (Odd spacing).\n    *   Example 3 ($R=2$): Walls at distance $D=1, 2, 4, 6, 8\\dots$ (Core at 1, 2; then Even spacing).\n    *   Example 2 ($R=3$): Walls at distance $D=1, 2, 4, 6\\dots$ (Core at 1, 2; then Even spacing).\n    \n    Since the Test Input has $R=4$ (which is $\\ge 2$), it follows the pattern of Examples 2 and 3. The \"Core\" walls connect the center to the standard even-spaced spiral.\n    *   **Walls are located at Chebyshev distances:** $D \\in \\{1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, \\dots\\}$.\n    *   **Gaps are located at distances:** $D \\in \\{3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, \\dots\\}$.\n    *   The center $(12, 10)$ itself is 0.\n\n3.  **Gates (Cuts in Walls):**\n    To form a spiral, each wall must have a \"gate\" (a 0) allowing the path to traverse between rings.\n    *   **Inner Walls ($D=1, 2$):** The gate is always on the bottom axis of the ring.\n        *   Wall 1 Gate: $(cy+1, cx)$.\n        *   Wall 2 Gate: $(cy+2, cx)$.\n    *   **Outer Walls ($D \\ge 4$, Even):** The gate shifts to the bottom-right. Based on the examples, the gate is located at $(cy+k, cx+k-1)$ for a wall at distance $k$.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Center:** $(12, 10)$.\n*   **Walls:** Draw square rings of 8s at distances $k = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14$.\n*   **Gates (set these pixels to 0):**\n    *   $k=1$: $(12+1, 10) = (13, 10)$.\n    *   $k=2$: $(12+2, 10) = (14, 10)$.\n    *   $k=4$: $(12+4, 10+3) = (16, 13)$.\n    *   $k=6$: $(12+6, 10+5) = (18, 15)$.\n    *   $k=8$: $(12+8, 10+7) = (20, 17)$.\n    *   $k=10$: $(12+10, 10+9) = (22, 19)$.\n    *   $k=12$: $(12+12, 10+11) = (24, 21)$.\n    *   $k=14$: $(12+14, 10+13) = (26, 23)$. *Note: Row 26 is off-grid, so this gate is not visible.*\n\n**Execution:**\nI will generate the 26x26 grid. For every cell $(y, x)$, I calculate the Chebyshev distance $d = \\max(|y-12|, |x-10|)$. If $d \\in \\{1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14\\}$, the cell is colored 8. Otherwise, it is 0. Then, I explicitly set the gate coordinates to 0.\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* The input contains a single centered light-blue plus on a black field; the output uses that same blue to create a large global structure.\n* The output blue cells form a connected, orthogonal, square-spiral/maze-like track with many right-angle turns and regular spacing.\n* The pattern expands to (or is constrained by) the full grid frame, suggesting dependence on grid size and a fixed winding convention.\n* The central plus appears to function as the seed/endpoint integrated into the spiral rather than as a separate unrelated object.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand how the input plus sign transforms into the spiral pattern.\n\n## Analysis\n\n**Input pattern:** A centered plus sign made of 8s on a black (0) background. The plus has:\n- Center at (12, 10) with value 0\n- Arm length of 4 cells extending in each cardinal direction\n\n**Output pattern observations from examples:**\n1. The original plus is preserved/integrated into the spiral\n2. The spiral winds outward from the center plus\n3. Vertical lines appear at even columns with spacing of 2\n4. Horizontal lines connect to form the spiral structure\n5. The pattern creates alternating wall/corridor sequences\n\n**Key rules I identified:**\n- The center column of the plus alternates between 8 and 0 above/below the plus arms based on distance (even distance = 8, odd distance = 0)\n- Even columns form the main vertical walls\n- Odd columns form corridors (mostly 0s)\n- The spiral extends to fill the entire grid\n- Each concentric \"ring\" connects via openings that alternate direction\n\n## Construction\n\nFor the 26\u00d726 grid with plus at (12,10) and arm length 4:\n- Plus occupies: rows 8-16 at col 10 (vertical), cols 6-14 at row 12 (horizontal)\n- The spiral frames expand at intervals of 2 from the plus boundaries\n- Each frame has walls on 3 sides with an opening that rotates to create the spiral\n\n```\n0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0\n8,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0\n8,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,0,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* The input contains a single centered light-blue plus on a black field; the output uses that same blue to create a large global structure.\n* The output blue cells form a connected, orthogonal, square-spiral/maze-like track with many right-angle turns and regular spacing.\n* The pattern expands to (or is constrained by) the full grid frame, suggesting dependence on grid size and a fixed winding convention.\n* The central plus appears to function as the seed/endpoint integrated into the spiral rather than as a separate unrelated object.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The input contains only one non-background color (8). The four light\u2011blue arms form a hollow plus: the intersection cell is still 0, but it is the unique cell that has 8 directly above, below, left, and right of it. That hollow center is kept as 0 in the output.\n\nFrom the examples, the output is built using the same non\u2011zero color to create a large, regular, orthogonal spiral/maze structure that expands to the full grid. A convenient way to reconstruct it is to generate a \u201crectangular spiral wall\u201d by repeatedly drawing a frame and then moving two cells inward (so there is always a 1\u2011cell gap between successive turns):\n\n- Start with an all\u20110 grid.\n- Maintain a shrinking rectangle `(top, bottom, left, right)`.\n- For each layer:\n  1) draw the left side from `top` to `bottom` (all 8),\n  2) draw the bottom side from `left` to `right` (all 8),\n  3) draw the right side upward from `bottom-1` to `top+1` (all 8),\n  4) draw the row just inside the top (`top+1`) from `right` down to `left+2` (all 8),\n  then shrink: `top+=2, left+=2, bottom-=2, right-=2`.\n- Finally, copy the input plus\u2019s 8-cells onto the result (they are part of the same blue structure), but keep the hollow plus center cell as 0.\n\nApplying that construction to the 17\u00d726 test grid gives:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* The input contains a single centered light-blue plus on a black field; the output uses that same blue to create a large global structure.\n* The output blue cells form a connected, orthogonal, square-spiral/maze-like track with many right-angle turns and regular spacing.\n* The pattern expands to (or is constrained by) the full grid frame, suggesting dependence on grid size and a fixed winding convention.\n* The central plus appears to function as the seed/endpoint integrated into the spiral rather than as a separate unrelated object.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (no rule guessing)\n\n### Inputs\n- Each input is a square grid with a uniform **black** background.\n- There is exactly **one non-black object**: a **light-blue plus/cross** shape (4-connected), centered roughly in the middle of the grid.\n- The plus shape varies in size across the three inputs (small in Input 1, largest in Input 2, medium in Input 3), but is always axis-aligned (horizontal/vertical arms).\n\n### Outputs\n- Each output is also a square grid (visually the **same size as its corresponding input**).\n- The output contains many **light-blue** cells arranged into a **nested, right-angled path pattern** that visually resembles a **square spiral / maze-like track**:\n  - Long horizontal/vertical segments with many 90\u00b0 turns.\n  - Multiple \u201crings\u201d or \u201ctracks\u201d separated by black space.\n- Only **black and light-blue** appear in the outputs.\n\n### Changes from input \u2192 output\n- The amount of **light-blue** increases dramatically: a small central plus becomes a large, grid-spanning structured pattern.\n- The background **black** remains present as the other color throughout.\n\n### What stays the same\n- The color palette is stable: **no new colors** are introduced.\n- The \u201cactive\u201d color is always the same **light-blue** used in the input\u2019s plus.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement**: maybe (the original plus might be embedded/continued into the new structure, but it\u2019s not clearly a simple move)\n- **Object recoloring**: absent (colors appear unchanged; only more blue is added)\n- **Bordering / outlining**: maybe (output looks like repeated boundary-like tracks)\n- **Filling holes or cavities**: absent\n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape**: absent (no noise present)\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning**: maybe (the plus may serve as a template/seed for replication-like growth)\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**: present (centered seed; output pattern relates strongly to global grid frame)\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**: maybe (the only rare color\u2014light-blue\u2014is the one expanded)\n- **Size-based filtering or selection**: maybe (plus size varies and output complexity/scale varies)\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations**: absent (spiral-like pattern is not mirror-symmetric)\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**: present (small seed expands into large connected structure)\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**: present (single small icon-like plus becomes a large structured pattern)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial details)\n\n1. **The output\u2019s blue region forms a \u201ctrack\u201d with consistent orthogonal turns** (not scattered filling): it\u2019s constructed as long runs + right angles, giving a maze/spiral appearance rather than blobs.\n2. **Spacing between neighboring blue \u201crings\u201d appears consistent** (parallel blue segments are separated by black gaps), suggesting a systematic step/increment rather than freeform drawing.\n3. **The transformation uses only the input\u2019s lone non-background color** as the drawing color for the entire generated structure.\n4. **The generated structure is global**: it spans close to the grid edges, implying the rule depends on the whole grid dimensions, not just local edits near the plus.\n5. **The central plus likely acts as a seed/terminal feature**: in at least one output (Output 2), a plus-like form is visible near the center of the spiral, suggesting the input object is incorporated into the final path rather than discarded.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nThe task takes the single centered light-blue plus as a **seed marker** and generates a **large, connected, square-spiral/maze-like path** in the same light-blue color across the grid. The spiral is made of axis-aligned segments with regular spacing between turns, expanding until it reaches near the grid boundary.  \nIf ambiguous: the spiral could be generated **outward from the plus** or **inward from the border toward the plus**, but in both cases the plus defines the anchor/endpoint and its color defines the drawn path.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks to perform when solving (validation probes)\n\n1. **Confirm preservation/embedding of the plus**: do the original plus pixels remain blue in the output at the same coordinates?\n2. **Determine spiral direction + start location**: is the outermost blue segment always starting at the same corner/edge and winding consistently (clockwise vs counterclockwise)?\n3. **Measure spacing/thickness**: is the spiral line 1-cell thick, and are adjacent \u201crings\u201d separated by exactly 1 black cell?\n4. **Relate plus size to spiral core**: does the input plus\u2019s arm length determine the size of the innermost spiral region or the stopping condition?\n5. **Confirm output size equals input size** (no cropping/rescaling).\n\n---\n\nHINT_START\n* The input contains a single centered light-blue plus on a black field; the output uses that same blue to create a large global structure.\n* The output blue cells form a connected, orthogonal, square-spiral/maze-like track with many right-angle turns and regular spacing.\n* The pattern expands to (or is constrained by) the full grid frame, suggesting dependence on grid size and a fixed winding convention.\n* The central plus appears to function as the seed/endpoint integrated into the spiral rather than as a separate unrelated object.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two primary object types defined by color 8 on a background of color 0. The first type is a \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape, composed of two perpendicular line segments that intersect at their midpoints. These crosses vary in size or span. The second type is a \"lattice\" structure composed of orthogonal (vertical and horizontal) line segments that form a grid or mesh. These lattices create enclosed rectangular regions.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Keep grid size unchanged and use only colors 0 and 8.  \n- Detect the hollow cross (8 arms around a 0 center), keep it in the same location and preserve its 0 center.  \n- Add many new 8 cells to build a global orthogonal lattice/maze: horizontal and vertical 8 line segments that connect/interact to form rectangular enclosures, often expanding from or completing around the cross.  \n- Cross arm length/center may control lattice spacing, segment lengths, or recursion depth; all non-lattice cells remain 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Current Thought Process for the ARC Task:**\n\nOkay, so I'm diving into this ARC task. The goal is to figure out a pattern from a few examples and apply it to a new input, right? It looks like I'm dealing with a kind of recursive pattern generation, maybe a fractal of some sort, based on these \"cross\" shapes.  Let's break down how I'm thinking about it:\n\n**Deconstructing the Input:** I'm starting by carefully analyzing the examples.  First, I'm trying to identify the key elements: the central \"cross\" shape (defined by two intersecting lines) within a larger grid of zeros.  The cross's size and position (specifically its *center* and *arm length*, which I'm calling *L*) seem to be the critical parameters. I\u2019ve noticed the central pixel of the cross is always empty (0) and that the number of pixels in each arm determines the length of that arm.\n\n**Pattern Hunting:** Next, I'm trying to discern the relationship between the input cross and the output grid. The output is a complex lattice of eights (8s), and I\u2019m looking for the underlying structure.  My initial thought is that it\u2019s probably a function of the center and arm length.  I'm trying to figure out how the arm length (L) influences the spacing or placement of these eights.\n\n**Lattice Structure:** I'm guessing there's a repeating unit or cell within the output grid, where each cell is either 0 or 8. I'm focusing on finding the unit or fractal building block.  My mind is wandering towards \"Sierpinski Carpet\" or fractal logic, which uses repetition. I'm checking if multiples of L create periodicities, but I'm not seeing an easy formula.\n\n**Refining the Lattice:** I'm starting to think about this as a lattice construction, where a base is the 2x2. and the number of nodes in that cross is dependent on the value of L.\n\n**Hypothesis: Distance Metrics and Coordinate Systems** I'm now exploring whether a coordinate system helps.  What if I center coordinates on the cross\u2019s central pixel, and then look at the distances from that center? I start testing various distance-based rules to determine which coordinates are 8s and which are 0s. The challenge is in defining those distance rules concisely.\n\n**Experimentation and Observations:** I'm using the examples as my test cases. I'm taking the input, drawing a lattice around the cross, and looking at where the 8s in the output land relative to the lattice intersections. It feels like the spacing is related to the arm length L, but it's not a simple one-to-one relationship.\n\n**Revised Hypothesis**: I'm now testing the idea that the lattice might be built on lines at even (or, multiples of) intervals relative to the center.  I am trying to confirm that the value of L correlates with the lattice spacing.\n\n**Maze Generation Theory:** I'm shifting to a \"maze\" or \"grid\" mindset. Is the output a maze? That is, are the eights the walls, and the zeros the pathways?  If so, how do I generate those walls? The arms are walls. What about intersections?\n\n**Recurrsion/Fractal Hypothesis:** The problem can also be a fractile logic, in which smaller shapes make larger shapes.\n\n**The Spacing Dilemma:** After reviewing several examples and checking the outputs to test my theories, I'm trying to determine the relationship with the size (L).\n\n**My strategy**: I think that the next step is to combine the best observations from each example and make a composite pattern which will give me the best output.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we analyze the relationship between the input \"cross\" shape and the generated \"lattice\" output in the solved examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1.  **Input:** The input contains a single \"hollow cross\" object made of color 8 on a background of 0. The cross is defined by a center $(r_c, c_c)$ (which is 0) and four arms of length $L$ extending from the center.\n    -   Example 1: Center (4,5), $L=1$.\n    -   Example 2: Center (9,9), $L=3$.\n    -   Example 3: Center (7,6), $L=2$.\n    -   Test Input: Center (12,10), $L=4$.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule (The \"Box\" Fractal):**\n    -   The output preserves the input cross (or mostly preserves it, connecting it to the new structure).\n    -   A rectangular \"Box\" or \"Wall\" is constructed around the cross. The walls of this box are located at a distance of $L+1$ from the center.\n        -   For Ex 1 ($L=1$): Walls at distance 2.\n        -   For Ex 3 ($L=2$): Walls at distance 3.\n        -   For Test ($L=4$): Walls should be at distance $4+1 = 5$.\n    -   Outside this central box, a global lattice repeats this \"wall\" pattern at intervals of 2 (or based on the spacing established by the box). The outer lattice consists of solid lines of 8s forming a grid of rectangular enclosures.\n    -   Inside the central box, the space remains empty (0s) except for the cross arms.\n    -   The cross arms connect to the surrounding box.\n\n3.  **Applying to Test Input:**\n    -   **Grid Size:** 26x26.\n    -   **Center:** $(12, 10)$.\n    -   **Arm Length ($L$):** 4. The arms extend from the center to relative coordinates $\\pm 4$.\n    -   **Box Construction:**\n        -   Distance $D = L + 1 = 5$.\n        -   Vertical Walls at columns $10 - 5 = 5$ and $10 + 5 = 15$.\n        -   Horizontal Walls at rows $12 - 5 = 7$ and $12 + 5 = 17$.\n        -   Draw solid lines of 8s along these rows/cols to form the central enclosure.\n    -   **Outer Lattice:**\n        -   Continue the grid pattern outwards with spacing 2 (observed in Ex 3).\n        -   Additional Horizontal Walls at $7-2=5, 3, 1$ and $17+2=19, 21, 23, 25$.\n        -   Additional Vertical Walls at $5-2=3, 1$ and $15+2=17, 19, 21, 23, 25$.\n        -   These lines create a grid of $2 \\times 2$ (internal 1x1) or similar sized blocks filling the rest of the image. Based on Ex 3, the lines are solid 8s.\n    -   **Inner Region (The Cross):**\n        -   Preserve the input cross 8s inside the central box (Rows 8-11, 13-16; Cols 6-9, 11-14).\n        -   Ensure the tips of the cross connect to the box. The tips are at distance 4, the box is at distance 5. They are adjacent, so they connect visually.\n    -   **Refinement:** In Ex 3, the lattice lines are \"solid\" but have a specific pattern. However, the most prominent feature is the bounding box and the solid outer grid. I will construct a solid grid of 8s on the calculated lines.\n\n**Constructed Output Grid:**\n-   **Horizontal 8-lines (Rows):** 1, 3, 5, 7, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25.\n-   **Vertical 8-lines (Cols):** 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25.\n-   **Central Cross:** Preserved at center (12, 10) with arms extending to the box.\n\n*Self-Correction on Outer Lattice Spacing:* In Ex 3, the outer lines are at intervals of 2 from the box wall.\nBox Wall at 3 (from center). Next line at 5? (Row 2 in Ex 3). $7-5=2$. Yes.\nSo for Test ($L=4$), Walls at $\\pm 5$. Next lines at $\\pm 7, \\pm 9 \\dots$?\nWait, Ex 3 had lines at $dist=3$ (Box) and $dist=5$ (Row 2).\nSo the spacing is 2.\nLines at relative distance $\\pm 5, \\pm 7, \\pm 9, \\pm 11, \\pm 13$.\nThis covers the whole grid.\n\n**Final Algorithm:**\n1.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two primary object types defined by color 8 on a background of color 0. The first type is a \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape, composed of two perpendicular line segments that intersect at their midpoints. These crosses vary in size or span. The second type is a \"lattice\" structure composed of orthogonal (vertical and horizontal) line segments that form a grid or mesh. These lattices create enclosed rectangular regions.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Keep grid size unchanged and use only colors 0 and 8.  \n- Detect the hollow cross (8 arms around a 0 center), keep it in the same location and preserve its 0 center.  \n- Add many new 8 cells to build a global orthogonal lattice/maze: horizontal and vertical 8 line segments that connect/interact to form rectangular enclosures, often expanding from or completing around the cross.  \n- Cross arm length/center may control lattice spacing, segment lengths, or recursion depth; all non-lattice cells remain 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the task is to decipher a pattern and reproduce it, or a variation of it, based on a few examples. The examples show patterns built on grids, with the input being a cross shape and the output being a more complex, fractal-like structure, so it seems I need to find the rule used to transform the cross into the output grid. The primary goal is to maintain the cross\u2019s location and the \"hollow center.\"\n\n**Deep Dive into Example 1**\n\nLooking at the first example, it appears that the input is a small cross, with the output showing a recursive pattern. The central element of the cross is preserved. I\u2019ll make a closer look to understand what happens to the output given a change of inputs. It starts as a simple cross with a 'hole' in the middle. The output is a complex pattern of 0s and 8s that looks a bit like a fractal or a grid structure of sorts, maybe related to the division by blocks of the grid. There's a hint in the prompt about the arms or center. The output seems to divide the grid in three by three blocks, in a recursive pattern that has a structure similar to the Sierpinski carpet. But not quite, as it's the center that is hollow.\n\n**Comparative Analysis and Identification of Key Parameters**\n\nMoving on to analyze other examples, in Example 3, the grid size is 16x16, which is convenient because it's a power of 2, making it easier to see how this recursive pattern might be defined. The input cross is larger. I'll meticulously parse it and verify the inputs to verify the inputs I am seeing.\n\nLet's look at the sizes and shapes of the crosses and the grid dimensions in each case to figure out what are the variables and constants: 12x12, 16x16, 22x22. Cross \"radii\" are 1, 2, and 3. I'm focusing on the radii of the crosses to see the connection between the cross radius and grid structure.\n\n**Formulating the Core Concept and Hypothesis**\n\nOkay, the pattern in each output is a global pattern that spans the entire grid. I have to create this grid from the parameters of the cross in input. Also I'm thinking of \"Pattern fill\" or \"Fractal generation\" given the nature of the output. Specifically, the \"H-tree\" or \"Vicsek fractal\", which are based on cross shapes. The outputs look like they may be Vicsek fractals, with some modification based on the input cross.\n\n**Refining the Understanding: Preserving the Cross**\n\nThe outputs are always full grids. The challenge is to add a pattern to the entire grid while preserving the cross and its hollow center. According to the problem prompt, the \"Hollow\" center should stay hollow. That should be a key element to preserve, let's look at it closer. In Example 2 the center doesn't seem to be preserved as 0, this may be a wrong analysis. I'm going to reread the problem prompt. Yes, it states the hollow center has to stay like that.\n\n**Discovering the Recursive Generation Rule**\n\nThe cross location is related to the generation of the output pattern, by setting the radius I may discover the rule. The radius determines how many times the recursive pattern has to be applied. In Example 3 I have a grid size of 16 and a Radius of 2.\n\n**Establishing the Lattice and Fractal Nature of the Pattern**\n\nThe spacing I see in the outputs and the fractal generation lead me to the fact that the output is likely a \"maze\" but the pattern seems to be based on an orthogonal grid. The grid is likely the \"lattice\" mentioned in the description, given the \"maze\" style. The prompt states I must build a lattice. I'm going to find the rules for the intersections and cell centers.\n\n**Fine-tuning the Logic: Coordinate-Based Analysis**\n\nI'm switching to a more coordinate-based perspective. Let\u2019s consider the coordinates relative to the cross's center. It looks like the pattern is generated based on a rule based on the distance from the center. I'm going to define the coordinate for a filled pixel. It depends on the distance from the center and the radius of the cross: `is_filled(x, y, cx, cy, R)`. The pattern should be built considering symmetry. I have to find a rule, `if` or `else`, that dictates when to fill a pixel with 8 or when to keep 0, given the center of the cross.\n\nI'm calculating distances from the center and comparing to the output values. The 8s in the output seem to follow a line pattern with breaks.\n\n**Identifying Lattice Spacing and its Relationship\n\nTo solve this task, I first analyzed the provided examples to understand the transformation rules.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Input Object**: The input contains a single \"hollow cross\" object made of color 8 on a background of 0. The cross consists of a vertical and a horizontal line segment intersecting at a 0 (hollow) center.\n    *   Example 1: Grid 12x12, Cross Radius $R=1$, Center (4,5).\n    *   Example 2: Grid 22x22, Cross Radius $R=3$, Center (12,9).\n    *   Example 3: Grid 16x16, Cross Radius $R=2$, Center (7,6).\n\n2.  **Output Pattern**: The output is a global \"lattice\" or grid pattern of color 8 filling the available space.\n    *   The lattice consists of orthogonal lines of 8s.\n    *   The empty spaces (0s) form a regular pattern of holes.\n    *   The \"holes\" are single cells (1x1) separated by lines of 8s. This implies a lattice spacing of 2 units (a hole every 2 pixels).\n\n3.  **Alignment Rule**:\n    *   In Example 1 ($R=1$, odd), the lattice lines are located at **odd** distances from the center.\n    *   In Example 3 ($R=2$, even), the lattice lines are located at **even** distances from the center.\n    *   In Example 2 ($R=3$, odd), the lattice lines are located at **odd** distances from the center.\n    *   Conclusion: The alignment of the lattice depends on the parity of the cross radius $R$. If $R$ is odd, lines are at odd distances ($|coord - center| \\% 2 \\neq 0$). If $R$ is even, lines are at even distances ($|coord - center| \\% 2 == 0$).\n\n4.  **Construction Logic**:\n    *   The lattice creates a value of 8 whenever a coordinate lies on a vertical or horizontal line defined by the alignment.\n    *   For $R$ even (like the test case), lines are at even relative coordinates ($d=0, 2, 4, \\dots$).\n    *   A cell is 8 if $|x - cx|$ is even **OR** $|y - cy|$ is even.\n    *   A cell is 0 only if both $|x - cx|$ and $|y - cy|$ are odd (these are the centers of the lattice cells).\n    *   **Exception**: The center of the cross $(cx, cy)$ corresponds to distances $(0,0)$, which would be an intersection (8) in the lattice. However, the problem states to \"preserve its 0 center\". Thus, the center must be explicitly set to 0.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Grid Size**: 26x26.\n2.  **Cross Identification**:\n    *   Scanning the input, the horizontal arm of the cross is on row 12: `...8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8...`.\n    *   The vertical arm is on column 10.\n    *   The cross center is at **(12, 10)** (Row 12, Column 10).\n    *   The arms extend 4 units in each direction, so **Radius $R=4$**.\n3.  **Lattice Parameters**:\n    *   $R=4$ is even.\n    *   Alignment: Lattice lines are at **even** distances from the center (10, 12).\n4.  **Generation**:\n    *   Iterate through all grid cells $(x, y)$ (where $x$ is column, $y$ is row).\n    *   Calculate distances: $dx = |x - 10|$, $dy = |y - 12|$.\n    *   If $dx$ is even **OR** $dy$ is even, set cell to 8.\n    *   Otherwise (both odd), set cell to 0.\n    *   Finally, force the center cell $(10, 12)$ to 0.\n\n**Completed Output Grid Generation:**\n*   Row 0 ($dy=12$, even): All 8s.\n*   Row 1 ($dy=11$, odd): 8s where $dx$ is even (cols 0, 2, 4...), 0s where $dx$ is odd.\n*   ...\n*   Row 12 ($dy=0$, even): All 8s (except center at col 10).\n*   ...\n\nOutput grid:\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nWait, let's double check row 12.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two primary object types defined by color 8 on a background of color 0. The first type is a \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape, composed of two perpendicular line segments that intersect at their midpoints. These crosses vary in size or span. The second type is a \"lattice\" structure composed of orthogonal (vertical and horizontal) line segments that form a grid or mesh. These lattices create enclosed rectangular regions.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Keep grid size unchanged and use only colors 0 and 8.  \n- Detect the hollow cross (8 arms around a 0 center), keep it in the same location and preserve its 0 center.  \n- Add many new 8 cells to build a global orthogonal lattice/maze: horizontal and vertical 8 line segments that connect/interact to form rectangular enclosures, often expanding from or completing around the cross.  \n- Cross arm length/center may control lattice spacing, segment lengths, or recursion depth; all non-lattice cells remain 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two primary object types defined by color 8 on a background of color 0. The first type is a \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape, composed of two perpendicular line segments that intersect at their midpoints. These crosses vary in size or span. The second type is a \"lattice\" structure composed of orthogonal (vertical and horizontal) line segments that form a grid or mesh. These lattices create enclosed rectangular regions.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Keep grid size unchanged and use only colors 0 and 8.  \n- Detect the hollow cross (8 arms around a 0 center), keep it in the same location and preserve its 0 center.  \n- Add many new 8 cells to build a global orthogonal lattice/maze: horizontal and vertical 8 line segments that connect/interact to form rectangular enclosures, often expanding from or completing around the cross.  \n- Cross arm length/center may control lattice spacing, segment lengths, or recursion depth; all non-lattice cells remain 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred rule (from the training examples)\n\n1. **Find the hollow cross**: it is the unique place where a `0` cell is surrounded (up/down/left/right) by `8` cells at the start of each arm.  \n   - Keep that center cell as `0` in the output.\n\n2. **Measure the arm length `L`**: from the center, count how many consecutive `8` cells extend in one direction before returning to `0`.  \n   - In the test input, each arm has length **4**.\n\n3. **Use the cross to define a global lattice spacing**: the distance from one \u201cjunction hole\u201d to the next is  \n   \\[\n   S = L + 1\n   \\]\n   so here **S = 5**.\n\n4. **Draw the full orthogonal lattice**:\n   - Draw full horizontal `8`-lines on rows spaced every `S` starting from the cross center row (wrapping both upward and downward within the grid).\n   - Draw full vertical `8`-lines on columns spaced every `S` starting from the cross center column.\n   - **At every intersection of a lattice row and a lattice column, put `0`** (this creates the \u201chollow\u201d junctions, including the original cross center).\n\nThis reproduces the examples\u2019 behavior: the cross is preserved as a hollow junction, and the rest of the grid is completed into a consistent orthogonal lattice.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid (26\u00d726)\n\n0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8\n0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two primary object types defined by color 8 on a background of color 0. The first type is a \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape, composed of two perpendicular line segments that intersect at their midpoints. These crosses vary in size or span. The second type is a \"lattice\" structure composed of orthogonal (vertical and horizontal) line segments that form a grid or mesh. These lattices create enclosed rectangular regions.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Keep grid size unchanged and use only colors 0 and 8.  \n- Detect the hollow cross (8 arms around a 0 center), keep it in the same location and preserve its 0 center.  \n- Add many new 8 cells to build a global orthogonal lattice/maze: horizontal and vertical 8 line segments that connect/interact to form rectangular enclosures, often expanding from or completing around the cross.  \n- Cross arm length/center may control lattice spacing, segment lengths, or recursion depth; all non-lattice cells remain 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the examples)\n\n1. **Identify the \u201chollow cross\u201d**: a single 0-cell whose four orthogonal neighbors are 8, and those arms may extend outward for some length.  \n   - Keep this cross **in the same position**.\n   - Keep its **center cell = 0**.\n   - Keep the **arm lengths** (the first 0 just beyond each arm remains 0, so the arm length stays the same).\n\n2. **Build the global orthogonal lattice** by filling the grid with **concentric square \u201crings\u201d** (axis-aligned perimeters) of color 8:\n   - For any cell `(r,c)`, compute its distance to the nearest border:  \n     `d = min(r, c, (H-1)-r, (W-1)-c)`.\n   - If `d` is **even**, that cell lies on an even-numbered ring \u21d2 set it to **8**.  \n   - If `d` is **odd**, leave it **0**.\n   - This creates a nested rectangular lattice of 8-perimeters separated by 0-gaps.\n\n3. **Overlay the detected cross on top of that lattice**:\n   - Force the cross arms\u2019 cells to 8 and the cross center to 0.\n   - Also force the first cell *just beyond* each arm endpoint to remain 0, preserving the arm length.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n```csv\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8\n8,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,8\n8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

                "response": "**Analyzing and Summarizing Object Types**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. The task is to describe the *types* of objects in the provided grids, without making any assumptions about rules or relationships, only describing what's present. First, I noticed that all grids have the numbers 0 and 8.  Since I've seen a lot of these, I assume 0 is the background and 8 is the object color. There are seven grids provided. They seemed to fall into two basic visual categories: crosses and something I initially thought was a maze but then realized was a more structured lattice.\n\nI went through the data systematically. First, I analyzed the grids individually, noting the overall structure. Then, I looked for patterns. I realized there were two major categories: simple cross-shapes (Grids 1, 5, 6, and 7) and more complex \"mesh-like\" patterns that I eventually classified as \"lattices\" (Grids 2, 3, and 4). Grid 1 was a large cross.\n\nThen, I looked at Grid 2, 3 and 4, the dense grids. They're composed of color 8 and had a repeating pattern. The color 8 forms something like a rectangular lattice of lines. I considered the alternative of calling the empty areas the \"objects\", but that's unusual for the ARC task design. The color 8 is the important part of the shape. Then I realized that each dense grid seemed to have a corresponding cross grid, and the dimensions match, except for Grid 1.\n\nSo, I formulated two distinct *object types*:\n\n*   **Crosses:** These are straightforward. They're made of two perpendicular lines of color 8 that intersect at their midpoint. The size of the \"arms\" of the cross can vary.\n*   **Lattices:** These are a bit more complex. They look like a grid of color 8 lines that form rectangles. The color 0 spaces are the rectangles. They cover most of the grid.\n\nI focused on a precise definition of the object type. Now, the final step is to put together the summary.\n\n<objects_summary>\nThe grids contain two primary object types defined by color 8 on a background of color 0. The first type is a \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape, composed of two perpendicular line segments that intersect at their midpoints. These crosses vary in size or span. The second type is a \"lattice\" structure composed of orthogonal (vertical and horizontal) line segments that form a grid or mesh. These lattices create enclosed rectangular regions.\n</objects_summary>\n\n\nBased on the visual data provided in the grids, here is a description of the objects involved:\n\nThe grids display graphic patterns composed exclusively of **color 8** pixels set against a background of **color 0**. There are two distinct types of object configurations present across the various grids.\n\n**1. Cross Objects**\nSeveral grids (specifically the first one, and the last three) feature a single, centered geometric object.\n*   **Shape:** These objects are shaped like a \"plus\" sign or a cross.\n*   **Composition:** They are formed by the intersection of one vertical line segment and one horizontal line segment of **color 8**.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   **Intersection:** The two lines intersect perpendicularly at their midpoints.\n    *   **Thickness:** The lines are one pixel wide.\n    *   **Size:** The overall span (height and width) of the cross varies between grids. For example, some crosses are small (spanning 3 pixels), while others are larger (spanning up to 9 pixels).\n    *   **Position:** The object is generally centered within the grid boundaries.\n\n**2. Lattice Structures**\nThe intermediate grids (the second, third, and fourth) contain a dense, grid-wide pattern rather than a single isolated shape.\n*   **Shape:** These objects appear as a complex mesh, net, or lattice.\n*   **Composition:** They are constructed from numerous horizontal and vertical segments of **color 8** that are interconnected.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   **Coverage:** Unlike the cross objects, these structures extend across the majority of the grid's area.\n    *   **Enclosures:** The network of **color 8** lines creates boundaries that define multiple rectangular regions of **color 0** (negative space).\n    *   **Pattern:** The arrangement resembles a maze or a subdivided floor plan composed of orthogonal walls.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1.  **Background**: Uniform field of color 0.\n2.  **Cross Objects**: Single, centered \"plus\" shapes made of color 8, composed of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines of variable length.\n3.  **Lattice Structures**: Dense, grid-wide networks of interconnected color 8 segments forming rectangular partitions and enclosures.\n</objects_summary>",

Objects Description\nThe grids contain two primary object types defined by color 8 on a background of color 0. The first type is a \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape, composed of two perpendicular line segments that intersect at their midpoints. These crosses vary in size or span. The second type is a \"lattice\" structure composed of orthogonal (vertical and horizontal) line segments that form a grid or mesh. These lattices create enclosed rectangular regions.",
                "response": "### Observed input \u2192 output changes (colors 0 and 8 only)\n\n#### 1) Object detection / interpretation\n- **Identify the single \u201ccross\u201d object** made of color **8** on a **0** background.\n- The cross in all examples is a **hollow intersection**:\n  - Two perpendicular 8-colored line segments,\n  - With the **intersection/center cell remaining 0** (the arms meet around a 0 center).\n- Measure cross properties that may drive later construction:\n  - **Center location** (row, col) of the hollow intersection (the 0 surrounded by 8s).\n  - **Arm length / span** = how far the 8-segments extend from the center in each of the 4 directions (often equal in all directions).\n\n#### 2) Preservation of the original cross\n- The original cross **is not moved** (no translation/rotation).\n- The original cross **is not recolored** (8 stays 8).\n- The cross\u2019s **center remains 0** in the output (no filling of the hollow center).\n\n#### 3) Addition of a large lattice/maze-like structure\n- The output contains a **much larger set of new 8-cells** than the input.\n- These new 8-cells form an orthogonal **lattice** (grid/mesh) consisting of:\n  - **Horizontal 8 line segments**\n  - **Vertical 8 line segments**\n  - Intersections and turns that create **enclosed rectangular regions** (rooms/cells).\n- This lattice is effectively a **global expansion/generation** from the single cross:\n  - The lattice either **connects to** or **incorporates** the cross (the cross becomes one junction inside the full structure).\n  - The resulting lattice can reach or interact with the **grid boundaries** (some borders become partly or fully lined with 8).\n\n#### 4) Likely construction principles implied by examples (multiple plausible mechanisms)\nFrom the examples, the lattice creation appears consistent with one (or a combination) of the following possible mechanisms:\n\n- **(A) Growth/extension from the cross**\n  - Treat the cross as a \u201cseed junction\u201d and **extend** orthogonal wall/line segments outward.\n  - Add further branches/segments as the growth proceeds, producing rectangles.\n\n- **(B) Recursive subdivision / nested rectangle building**\n  - Add 8-lines that act like repeated partitions, forming progressively smaller or shifted rectangular compartments.\n\n- **(C) Scaled lattice based on the cross arm length**\n  - The measured **arm length** may set:\n    - Spacing between major lattice lines,\n    - Typical segment lengths between turns,\n    - Or an iteration/depth parameter controlling how much of the grid becomes filled with lattice.\n\n- **(D) Template completion**\n  - The cross can be interpreted as a recognizable local motif of a bigger lattice, and the output completes the **full lattice pattern** across the entire grid, ensuring the cross remains consistent with it.\n\n#### 5) Background handling\n- Cells that are not part of the generated lattice remain **0**.\n- No new colors appear; the transformation is strictly **0 \u2194 8 placement**, with **only additions of 8** being clearly necessary (the cross itself is preserved).\n\n---\n\n<transformation_summary>\n- Keep grid size unchanged and use only colors 0 and 8.  \n- Detect the hollow cross (8 arms around a 0 center), keep it in the same location and preserve its 0 center.  \n- Add many new 8 cells to build a global orthogonal lattice/maze: horizontal and vertical 8 line segments that connect/interact to form rectangular enclosures, often expanding from or completing around the cross.  \n- Cross arm length/center may control lattice spacing, segment lengths, or recursion depth; all non-lattice cells remain 0.  \n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two primary object types defined by color 8 on a background of color 0. The first type is a \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape, composed of two perpendicular line segments that intersect at their midpoints. These crosses vary in size or span. The second type is a \"lattice\" structure composed of orthogonal (vertical and horizontal) line segments that form a grid or mesh. These lattices create enclosed rectangular regions.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Keep grid size unchanged and use only colors 0 and 8.  \n- Detect the hollow cross (8 arms around a 0 center), keep it in the same location and preserve its 0 center.  \n- Add many new 8 cells to build a global orthogonal lattice/maze: horizontal and vertical 8 line segments that connect/interact to form rectangular enclosures, often expanding from or completing around the cross.  \n- Cross arm length/center may control lattice spacing, segment lengths, or recursion depth; all non-lattice cells remain 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
