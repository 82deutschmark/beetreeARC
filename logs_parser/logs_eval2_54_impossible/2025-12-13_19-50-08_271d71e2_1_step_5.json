            "Full raw LLM response": "**Comprehensive ARC Task Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've been tasked with solving an ARC problem, and after carefully analyzing the provided examples, I believe I've cracked the code for a specific type of transformation. My initial focus was on the first example and its distinct parts: a magenta background, a maroon rectangle, and a black-framed region with internal gray and orange elements. I observed how the elements shifted and changed between the input and output grids.\n\nInitially, I pinpointed the regions that had changed. The first key insight came when I examined the \"frames\" which were black blocks of zeros. In the first example, these frames clearly moved up. They also seem to consume or interact with blocks of 9s above them. In the first case, the frame moved up by one row, seemingly \"replacing\" a row of nines in the process. When a frame touched a block of 9s, the internals of the frame changed. \n\nThe most important observation was the relationship between the frames, and the changes that occur to 5s that become 7s. In the output, it seemed as though all of the contents within the frame were changed. \n\nAnalyzing the second example, I found a situation where frames didn't move. The frame was located underneath rows of 9s. I thought there might be a \"fuel\" source or perhaps some sort of radiation. In the second example, I noticed a change from 5s to 7s inside the frames even when they weren't directly adjacent to 9s. This was puzzling. But the most important discovery was about the frames and the direction of movement.\n\nThrough a third example, it became clear that the key interaction was between 9s and the frames. When the frame touches the 9s, it moves into that direction. The key became the interaction with the 9s. It's when the 0-frame touches the 9s. The movement is dependent on contact. The second frame may have just filled in based on proximity. The key became that the 5s in the frame would always attempt to turn into 7s. If the 5s were not touching the nines, they would still fill up. \n\nAfter detailed observation, I formulated the following rules: Frames containing 5s attempt to move toward and consume adjacent 9s. Frames will not move if already full. The 9s represent an amount that the 5s will fill. In addition, I also found the quantity of 5s changing into 7s is related to the distance. In the test input, I could measure the quantity, and apply this for a predicted result. For instance, Frame 3 has a huge block of 7s and a single 5. If this is a movement, then there must be 8 items in the target, and 7 7s. If the direction of the move is known, then the output grid is straightforward. \n\n\nThe logic for the transformation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Object Identification**:\n    *   **Frames**: Rectangular regions bordered by 0s (black) containing 5s (gray) and/or 7s (orange).\n    *   **9-Blocks**: Regions of 9s (maroon).\n    *   **Background**: 6s (magenta).\n\n2.  **Interaction Rule**:\n    *   A frame that **contains 5s** and is **adjacent** to a block of 9s will **move one step** into the 9s (consuming the adjacent row/column of 9s).\n    *   A frame that contains only 7s (full) or is not adjacent to 9s does not move.\n    *   Movement direction is determined by the position of the 9s relative to the frame (e.g., if 9s are below, move down; if above, move up).\n\n3.  **Internal Transformation**:\n    *   For every step a frame moves (consuming \"fuel\" from the 9s), **one unit of 5s** inside the frame is converted to **7s**.\n    *   The conversion happens adjacent to existing 7s, prioritizing the side of the frame in the **direction of motion** (simulating accumulation or deposition). If no 7s exist, it seeds at the leading edge.\n\n4.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   **Frame 1 (Top Right, C11-C15)**: Contains 5s. Adjacent to 9s **below** (Row 8).\n        *   Action: Move **Down 1 step** (from R1-R7 to R2-R8).\n        *   Internal: Convert one 5 to 7. The existing 7 is at the bottom-right. The new 7 fills the adjacent spot at the bottom (leading edge).\n    *   **Frame 2 (Right, C22-C25)**: Contains **only 7s**. Adjacent to 9s below.\n        *   Action: **No move** (already full).\n    *   **Frame 3 (Bottom Left, C1-C7)**: Contains 5s. Adjacent to 9s **above** (Row 12).\n        *   Action: Move **Up 1 step** (from R13-R23 to R12-R22).\n        *   Internal: Convert one 5 to 7. Existing 7s are at the top. The \"front\" of 7s advances downwards by one pixel (filling the single 5 at R16).\n    *   **Frame 4 (Bottom Right, C17-C19)**: Contains 5s. Adjacent to 9s **above** (Row 18).\n        *   Action: Move **Up 1 step** (from R19-R25 to R18-R24).\n        *   Internal: Convert one 5 to 7. Existing 7s are at the top. The topmost 5 (at R22) becomes 7.\n\n5.  **Clean-up**:\n    *   Original positions of moving frames become background (6).\n    *   Overlapped 9s are removed (replaced by the frame).\n    *   Non-overlapped 9s remain.\n\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,9,9,9,9\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Prediction for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with solving an ARC problem, and the initial approach is to break down the example into smaller pieces. After that the analysis starts with examining the movement rules of \"boxes\" and their relationship with a specific color, magenta. It involves careful tracking of pixel coordinates, especially within these bounding boxes. From the initial examination, the analysis identifies two key entities: a magenta background (6), boxes outlined in black (0) containing grey pixels (5) and maroon/magenta (9) bars. The initial understanding is, the magenta (9) bars appear above containers and seems that there is interaction between those parts.\n\nThe analysis becomes significantly complex when dealing with the input and output grids. This involves tracking pixel-by-pixel changes and attempts to establish the nature of these changes to find relationships in values. Furthermore, the analysis tries to establish the connections between \"boxes\", the \"bars\" and the 7 color, for example, 5s turning into 7s. The boxes move up one unit while \"eating\" one row of 9s, the change in the content within the box is an important part of the problem. Also, the 9 seems to project their pattern into the grey pixels. I am trying to understand the rules that govern the conversion, such as the position of the 9s, and the geometry of each box. The main logic seems to be to figure out a clear pattern of how the content of each of the boxes is transformed in terms of the initial state of the input and the interaction with the 9 bar.\n\nThe analysis is followed by a more robust hypothesis on the nature of the rule. The logic of moving boxes and coloring them and all the interactions are thoroughly analyzed. The problem is approached using examples that allow to validate the hypothesis. The core logic is: boxes move towards, and into, the adjacent 9-blocks, replacing the row of 9s. Then based on the properties of the 9 and the position of each box content is converted to another set of numbers. 7s grow when next to the adjacent 9. All of this is done while making assumptions and doing hypothesis testing based on the data provided.\n\nThe approach here is a methodical examination of examples, hypothesis formulation, validation, and eventually applying the extracted rule to make predictions on the behavior of new, unseen input. Once a set of clear rules have been established, this knowledge can be converted to code.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I performed a hierarchical object analysis on the input grid, separating the grid into \"background\" (color 6), \"maroon bars\" (color 9), and \"container boxes\" (frames of color 0 containing pixels of color 5 or 7).\n\n**Analysis of Dynamics:**\n1.  **Movement Rule:** Boxes that are vertically or horizontally adjacent to a Maroon (9) block\u2014or separated by empty space but aligned with one\u2014move 1 step *into* the Maroon block. This movement \"consumes\" the layer of 9s they move into.\n    *   In Example 1, boxes moved UP into the 9s.\n    *   In Example 3, a box moved RIGHT into the 9s.\n    *   In the Test Input, boxes are positioned such that:\n        *   Box 1 (Center) is above 9s -> Moves DOWN.\n        *   Box 2 (Right) is above 9s -> Moves DOWN.\n        *   Box 3 (Left) is below 9s -> Moves UP.\n        *   Box 4 (Bottom Right) is below 9s -> Moves UP.\n\n2.  **Coloring Rule (The \"Infection\"):** When a box touches the Maroon (9) block (the source), the Grey (5) pixels inside the box begin to turn into Orange (7). The transformation mimics a fluid filling the box or a progressive infection starting from the side touching the 9s.\n    *   The amount of filling correlates with the movement. A single step move results in a small amount of new 7s (typically 1-2 pixels).\n    *   The filling direction follows a pattern based on the source side. For a box moving UP (Source Top), the fill favors the Top-Left. For a box moving DOWN (Source Bottom), the fill favors the Bottom-Right.\n    *   Box 1 (Center): Moves Down. Source Bottom. Fills 1 pixel at Bottom-Right.\n    *   Box 2 (Right): Moves Down. Source Bottom. Already full of 7s. No change.\n    *   Box 3 (Left): Moves Up. Source Top. Fills the remaining 5 in the third row.\n    *   Box 4 (Bottom Right): Moves Up. Source Top. Fills one 5 to 7.\n\n**Step-by-Step Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Box 1 (Center, Cols 11-15):** Originally R0-R7. Moves **DOWN** to R1-R8. Consumes 9s at R8.\n    *   Content (Cols 12-14) shifts to R2-R7.\n    *   Transformation: Bottom-Right pixel of content (R7, C14) changes 5 -> 7.\n2.  **Box 2 (Right, Cols 22-25):** Originally R0-R13. Moves **DOWN** to R1-R14. Consumes 9s at R14.\n    *   Content (Cols 23-24) shifts to R2-R13.\n    *   Transformation: Content was all 7s, remains all 7s.\n3.  **Box 3 (Left, Cols 1-7):** Originally R13-R23. Moves **UP** to R12-R22. Consumes 9s at R12.\n    *   Content (Cols 2-6) shifts to R13-R21.\n    *   Transformation: Row 3 of content had one 5. It becomes 7. Now Rows 1-3 are full 7s.\n4.  **Box 4 (Bottom Right, Cols 17-19):** Originally R20-R25. Moves **UP** to R19-R24. Consumes 9s at R19.\n    *   Content (Col 18) shifts to R20-R23.\n    *   Transformation: Input was 7,7,5,5. Top-most 5 becomes 7. Result: 7,7,7,5.\n5.  **Background & Static Objects:**\n    *   R0 becomes background (6).\n    *   R25 (Cols 1-19) becomes background (6) where boxes vacated.\n    *   Existing 9s at R3 (Cols 1-7), R14 (Cols 17-19), and R25 (Cols 22-25) remain.\n\nThe final grid is constructed by placing these moved and modified objects onto the background.\n\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9",

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the following transformation rules:\n\n1. **Identify rectangular boxes** (bordered by 0s, containing 5s and/or 7s) and **9-lines** that act as directional guides\n2. **Boxes move toward adjacent 9-lines**, absorbing them in the process\n3. **7s expand within boxes** from the side nearest to the 9-lines (the \"near side\") toward the opposite side (the \"far side\")\n4. Boxes that are completely filled with 7s serve as templates; partial boxes get their 7s expanded\n\nFor the test input:\n- **Box A** (rows 0-7, cols 11-15): Has one 7 at bottom-right. 9-line below at row 8. Moves down, 7s expand from bottom.\n- **Box B** (rows 0-13, cols 22-25): All 7s (template). 9-line at row 14. Moves down by 1.\n- **Box C** (rows 13-23, cols 1-7): Has 7s at top rows. 9-line above at row 12. Moves up, 7s expand from top.\n- **Box D** (rows 19-25, cols 17-19): Has 7s at top. 9-line at row 18. Moves up, 7s expand downward.\n\nThe 9-lines at rows 3 (cols 1-7), row 14 (cols 17-19), row 23 (cols 11-15), and row 25 (cols 22-25) remain as they're not adjacent to boxes after movement.\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,0,5,5,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9\n```",

All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reflecting on the ARC Task: My Approach to Solving It**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to solve these ARC puzzles. Here's how I'm thinking about it, using the test input and the pattern-recognition skills I've developed:\n\n*   **Initial Observations:** I see a common structure: a magenta background, black-bordered rectangular objects, and inside these rectangles, a combination of gray and orange pixels. Maroon shapes are also present, often (but not always!) near the boxes.\n\n*   **Pattern Detection:** I quickly zoned in on what I thought was key, the \"maroon (9)\" shapes. Their relationship with the black-bordered boxes is central.\n\n*   **Hypotheses about the \"Maroon (9)\" Shapes:**\n    *   **They're Instructions:** I initially thought these maroon shapes were instructions, indicating how the box should transform.\n    *   **They Determine Movement:** I tested the idea that the maroon shape indicated the *direction* the box should move (up, down, left, or right), and it looked promising. I tested the *Distance* too.\n\n*   **The \"Coloring\" Effect:** Whenever the box moves or is adjacent to a maroon shape, there's a color transformation of the pixels inside the black box. Grey (5) and Orange (7).\n\n*   **First Attempt at Coloring Mechanics:** It seemed like the amount of 7s might be related to the amount of 9s in the maroon shape (Ex 1, 9s), or a \"filling\" or \"propagating\" process.\n\n*   **Digging Deeper:** This led to a more nuanced view:\n    *   The box, in a manner, **slid towards a maroon shape**. The maroon acted like a magnet, and the box moved in that direction, step by step, or, for some examples, until it \"hit\" an obstruction or the edge of the grid.\n    *   The adjacent maroon shapes turned adjacent pixels into orange (7), so I assumed the new pixels became orange from the leading edge into the box as a function of the movement.\n    *   The rule was, so it seemed: **Move and then Fill the box with orange on the side touching the maroon shape**.\n\n*   **Test Input Confirmation:** This is where the test input really helped. Based on all the other examples, I had to try and predict what the result would be, and the best method seemed to be:\n    *   Move boxes towards their maroon neighbors (one step).\n    *   Fill interior with orange.\n    *   Distant maroon shapes (not immediately adjacent) stay in place in the grid.\n    *   Overlapping maroon shapes and 0 borders disappear.\n\n*   **Prediction:** I created a coordinate shift for the three boxes in the test input based on the theory above, then constructed the output, and I am satisfied I could reproduce the output grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify a transformation rule based on input-output examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Objects:** The grid contains rectangular \"boxes\" with a black border (color 0) and an interior filled with grey (5) and/or orange (7). There are also \"maroon blocks\" (color 9) adjacent to these boxes. The background is magenta (6).\n2.  **Movement:** The maroon blocks act as directional indicators or \"magnets\".\n    *   If a maroon block is **above** a box, the box moves **UP** by 1 step.\n    *   If a maroon block is **below** a box, the box moves **DOWN** by 1 step.\n    *   (From examples, left/right positioning causes left/right movement, specifically moving *towards* the maroon block).\n3.  **Interaction:** When a box moves, it consumes/overlaps the adjacent maroon pixels. The maroon pixels that are covered by the box's new position disappear. Distant maroon pixels remain unchanged.\n4.  **Color Transformation (The \"Ink\" or \"Heat\" Effect):** The interaction with the maroon block changes the interior color of the box. The maroon color (9) acts as a source of orange (7) \"ink\".\n    *   When the box moves into the maroon block, the interior pixels of the box fill with orange (7).\n    *   In the examples, this filling seems to propagate from the \"leading edge\" (the side touching the 9s) or fills the box completely if the box is small/the interaction is strong.\n    *   Given the test input's boxes are largely filled with 5s or a mix of 5s and 7s, and the examples show a tendency to fill with 7s upon interaction, the rule is to **fill the interior of the moving boxes with 7s**.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\nThe Test Input contains three distinct boxes:\n\n1.  **Small Box (Left Column):**\n    *   **Position:** Rows 3-7 (Border), Columns 11-15.\n    *   **Maroon Indicator:** Directly **BELOW** at Row 8 (Cols 11-15).\n    *   **Action:** Move **DOWN** 1 step.\n    *   **New Position:** Rows 4-8.\n    *   **Coloring:** Interior fills with 7s.\n    *   **Maroon Removal:** The 9s at Row 8 are overwritten by the box's new bottom border/interior.\n\n2.  **Small Box (Right Column):**\n    *   **Position:** Rows 7-13 (Border), Columns 22-25.\n    *   **Maroon Indicator:** Directly **BELOW** at Row 14 (Cols 22-25).\n    *   **Action:** Move **DOWN** 1 step.\n    *   **New Position:** Rows 8-14.\n    *   **Coloring:** Interior fills with 7s (Input was already mostly 7s).\n    *   **Maroon Removal:** The 9s at Row 14 are overwritten.\n\n3.  **Big Box (Left Column):**\n    *   **Position:** Rows 13-23 (Border), Columns 1-8.\n    *   **Maroon Indicator:** Directly **ABOVE** at Row 12 (Cols 1-8). (There are also 9s at Row 3, but they are distant).\n    *   **Action:** Move **UP** 1 step.\n    *   **New Position:** Rows 12-22.\n    *   **Coloring:** Interior fills with 7s (Input had 5s at the bottom, these become 7s).\n    *   **Maroon Removal:** The 9s at Row 12 are overwritten by the box's new top border. The 9s at Row 3 are untouched.\n\n**Other Elements:**\n*   The maroon line at Row 3 (Cols 1-8) remains (too far to be touched).\n*   The maroon pixels at the bottom right (Row 26, Cols 22-25) remain (too far).\n*   The background (6) remains 6 unless covered by a moved box. Old box positions that are vacated are filled with background (6).\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n\n*   **Row 0-2:** Background (6).\n*   **Row 3:** Background (6), except Cols 1-8 are 9s (Maroon bar). The Small Left Box moved away from here, so Cols 11-15 become 6.\n*   **Row 4:** Small Left Box starts here (Top Border).\n*   **Row 5-7:** Small Left Box interior/borders.\n*   **Row 8:** Small Left Box ends here (Bottom Border). Small Right Box starts here (Top Border).\n*   ... (and so on for other boxes) ...\n*   **Row 12:** Big Box starts here (Top Border). Replaces old 9s.\n*   **Row 22:** Big Box ends here (Bottom Border).\n*   **Row 26:** Background (6) with 9s at Cols 22-25.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing and Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. My job is to figure out the rule that transforms the inputs into the outputs. I've got three example pairs to learn from and a test input to apply my knowledge to. \n\n**Initial Observations**\n\nThe background color is a consistent magenta (color 6), and there are structures made of maroon, black, and gray/orange pixels. These structures look like rectangular blocks, frames, and filled areas. My first goal is to understand how these parts relate to each other in the input and output.\n\n**Breaking Down the Components**\n\nI'm starting by analyzing the input/output pairs in detail:\n\n*   **Maroon (9) shapes:** These are clearly rectangular blocks. They appear connected to or separate from black frames and sometimes contain gray (5) and orange (7) pixels.\n*   **Black (0) frames:** These define the boundaries of the areas that get filled with gray and orange pixels.\n\n**Understanding the Transformation**\n\nThe task seems to be about how the maroon bars/blocks affect the contents of the black frames. The key seems to be figuring out what *triggers* the change from the input (gray pixels) to the output (orange pixels).\n\n*   **Example 1:** I see that the maroon block on top of the black frame causes the gray pixels inside to change to orange. This implies a \"push\" or \"heat\" influence is coming from the maroon block.\n*   **Example 2:** With the maroon bar on the side, the change happens in a pattern, which seems to propagate from the bar direction. If the bar is on the right, the orange pixels spread left. This is looking like a directional process, potentially linked to the number of gray pixels initially or how the grid is setup to propagate. I think about it as \"fire spreading\" in the direction of the bar.\n\n**Developing the Core Hypothesis**\n\nBased on this, I'm forming the core idea:\n\n*   The **maroon bar acts as a source of orange (7) pixels.**\n*   The \"source\" emits orange pixels (i.e. converts gray 5s to 7s).\n*   The orange emission expands in a particular **direction relative to the maroon bar.** This is the critical factor.\n*   The 7s spread through a \"medium\" (the black frame).\n\n** Refining and Testing the Hypothesis**\n\nNow, I need to define the rule more precisely and validate it across all examples.\n\n*   **Directional Spread:** The direction of spread is directly related to the position of the maroon bar (top, bottom, left, or right). I believe that the wind originates from the bar, so for example if the bar is on the left, 7s spread right.\n*   **Propagation Rate:** The number of '5s' that are changed to '7s' is not all the same, so there is more to it than just that they become '7s', there must be an upper bound. I need to explain the cases where not all pixels become orange (i.e. they do not all get \"activated\" or changed). It is important to remember that there might be a bias with the initial numbers.\n*   **\"Last Pixel Is Safe\":** I think that the \"safety\" means that the last layer of pixels does not turn from gray to orange. If that happens then not all pixels transform.\n\n**Test Application**\n\nNow for the test input and what I think the rules is:\n\n*   **Objects:** I see three distinct objects, each with black frames and maroon bars, with a 7 already placed, and mostly 5s.\n*   **Apply the Rule:** I'll apply my propagation rule to each object, keeping the \"Last layer safe\" rule I learned. I expect Box A will fill up almost fully (but leaving the top row unchanged), Box B will stay unchanged, and Box C will mostly fill (except bottom layer will have 5s).\n*   **Detailed Predictions:**\n    *   **Box A:** Bar at the Bottom, upward spread. Top (row 1) will have 5s, all else 7s.\n    *   **Box B:** Already 7s. No change.\n    *   **Box C:** Bar at the Top, downward spread. Bottom (row 24) will be 5, all else will be 7s.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nSo, with my analysis and a bit of iteration, I've arrived at my understanding of the solution, which I have laid out step-by-step. I'm ready to predict and submit my final answer.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify a transformation rule based on the provided examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Objects:** The grid contains structures composed of:\n    *   **Maroon (9) Bars:** These act as \"sources\" or \"activators\".\n    *   **Black (0) Frames:** These act as containers.\n    *   **Grey (5) and Orange (7) Pixels:** These are the contents of the containers.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   The Maroon Bar acts as a source of **orange (7) \"fluid\" or \"heat\"**.\n    *   This influence propagates from the bar into the adjacent black frame.\n    *   The direction of propagation is determined by the position of the Maroon Bar relative to the Black Frame:\n        *   **Bar on Top:** Influence spreads **Down**.\n        *   **Bar on Bottom:** Influence spreads **Up**.\n        *   **Bar on Left:** Influence spreads **Right**.\n        *   **Bar on Right:** Influence spreads **Left**.\n    *   **Effect:** The influence turns Grey (5) pixels into Orange (7) pixels.\n    *   **Extent:** The filling is directional and fills the majority of the container's 5s, but typically leaves the **furthest layer** of pixels (relative to the source) unchanged.\n        *   In Example 2 (Middle-Left), the bar is on the Right. The 7s fill leftwards, converting 3 columns of 5s, but leaving the leftmost column as 5s.\n        *   In Example 3 (Top-Left), the bar is on the Right. The 7s fill leftwards, leaving the leftmost pixels as 5s (mostly).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\nThe test input contains three distinct objects:\n\n1.  **Top-Middle Object (Box A):**\n    *   **Location:** Black frame at columns 11-15, rows 0-7.\n    *   **Maroon Bar:** Located directly **below** the box (Row 8).\n    *   **Direction:** **Up**.\n    *   **Action:** The \"orange fluid\" rises from the bottom. It converts the grey (5) pixels into orange (7) pixels.\n    *   **Extent:** Following the \"leave furthest layer\" heuristic, the bottom rows of the interior will turn to 7s, while the top row (Row 1) will remain 5s.\n    *   **Input Content:** Rows 1-5 are `5,5,5`. Row 6 is `5,5,7`.\n    *   **Output Content:** Row 1 stays `5,5,5`. Rows 2-6 become `7,7,7`.\n\n2.  **Top-Right Object (Box B):**\n    *   **Location:** Black frame at columns 22-25, rows 0-12.\n    *   **Maroon Bar:** Located **below** (Row 14).\n    *   **Direction:** Up.\n    *   **Action:** The interior is already filled with `7,7`. Since they are already orange, no change occurs.\n\n3.  **Bottom-Left Object (Box C):**\n    *   **Location:** Large black frame at columns 1-9, rows 14-24.\n    *   **Maroon Bar:** Located **above** the box (Row 12).\n    *   **Direction:** **Down**.\n    *   **Action:** The orange fluid flows down.\n    *   **Extent:** It will convert the grey (5) pixels to orange (7) pixels, filling downwards. The bottom-most row of the interior (Row 23) will remain 5s (furthest from source).\n    *   **Input Content:** Rows 15-16 are `7`s. Row 17 is `7,7,7,7,5`. Rows 18-23 are `5`s.\n    *   **Output Content:** Rows 15-22 become (or stay) full `7`s. Row 23 remains `5`s.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\n*   **Object A (Cols 11-15):** Change Rows 2-6 to `7,7,7`.\n*   **Object C (Cols 1-9):** Change Rows 17-22 to `7,7,7,7,7`.\n*   All other pixels remain exactly as in the input.\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,9,9,9,9\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,9,9,9,9\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred rule (from the solved examples)\n\nThe grids contain **rectangular \u201cframes\u201d** made of color **0** (a 1-cell thick border). Inside each frame are colors **5** and sometimes **7**. Near each frame there is a **solid bar of color 9** that touches the frame along its full side (same length as that side). Elsewhere in the grid there is another **separate 9-bar of the same shape** (same orientation and same length).  \n\nFor each frame:\n\n1. **Identify the attached 9-bar**: a contiguous segment of 9s that is *directly adjacent* to one side of a 0-bordered frame and spans the whole side length.\n2. **Identify the target 9-bar**: another 9-segment with the same length and orientation, not attached to that frame.\n3. **Translate the frame together with its attached bar** so that the attached bar **lands exactly on top of** the target bar (the 9-bars merge).\n   - The translation distance is the absolute shift needed (in these cases, purely vertical).\n   - The original location of the moved frame+bar is replaced by background **6**.\n4. Let **N = translation distance** (number of shifted cells).\n   Then **convert N cells of color 5 to color 7 inside the moved frame**, choosing the cells closest (Manhattan distance) to a specific *corner of the frame border*:\n   - The corner is the one **counterclockwise from the side where the 9-bar is attached**:\n     - attached on **top**  \u2192 use **top-left** border corner  \n     - attached on **bottom** \u2192 use **bottom-right** border corner  \n     - (left/right cases match the examples similarly)\n   - Pick the **N nearest 5-cells** to that corner (ties broken by preferring smaller horizontal offset first, matching the examples).\n\nApplying this to the test grid:\n- Frame at (rows 1\u20138, cols 12\u201316) moves down to align its bottom-attached bar (row 9) with the 9-bar at row 24, converting 15 nearest 5s to 7s.\n- Large frame at (rows 14\u201324, cols 2\u20138) moves up to align its top-attached bar (row 13) with the 9-bar at row 4, converting 9 nearest 5s to 7s.\n- Right frame at (rows 1\u201314, cols 23\u201326) moves down to align bar row 15 with bar row 27 (no 5s inside to convert).\n- Small frame at (rows 20\u201327, cols 18\u201320) moves up to align bar row 19 with bar row 15, converting all its 5s to 7s (N=4 but only 3 fives exist).\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,7,7,7,7,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,7,7,7,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,7,7,7,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,7,7,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,7,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0  \n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9",

            "Full raw LLM response": "### Observations from the solved examples\n\nThere are three \u201cbackground\u201d/structural colors:\n\n- **6** = background.\n- **9** = rigid \u201cdocking bars\u201d (straight bars/blocks that act like anchors).\n- **0** = rectangular \u201cpanels\u201d (they are rectangles of 0 containing interior pixels of **5** and/or **7**).\n\nTwo consistent behaviors appear in the examples:\n\n1. **Panel relocation using 9-bars as anchors**  \n   A panel that sits immediately next to a 9-bar is moved so that it docks to the *other* matching 9-bar in that local structure.  \n   - In Example 3, a panel next to a vertical 9-bar is shifted horizontally to dock to the other vertical 9-bar.\n   - In Example 2, panels similarly shift so their associated \u201cdock\u201d aligns with the other dock-bar in that region.\n\n2. **Interior \u201cspread\u201d of color 7 inside the moved panel**  \n   After relocation, **7 expands into adjacent 5 cells** inside that panel (the border 0 and the background 6 and bars 9 do not change).  \n   In the examples, this spread is limited (not a full flood fill); it behaves like **two steps of 4-neighborhood (Manhattan) dilation** from existing 7-cells inside the panel.\n\n### Applying this to the test grid\n\n#### Step A \u2014 Find dock-bar pairs (9) and their attached panels (0-rectangles)\n\nIn the test input there are three clear \u201cdock-and-panel\u201d situations:\n\n1. **A wide panel at rows 14\u201324, cols 2\u20138** is directly under a 9-bar at **row 13, cols 2\u20138**.  \n   There is another matching 9-bar at **row 4, cols 2\u20138**.  \n   \u2192 Move that panel upward so it docks to the row-4 bar (shift **\u22129 rows**).\n\n2. **A panel at rows 1\u20138, cols 12\u201316** is directly above a 9-bar at **row 9, cols 12\u201316**.  \n   There is another matching 9-bar at **row 24, cols 12\u201316**.  \n   \u2192 Move that panel downward so it docks to the row-24 bar (shift **+15 rows**).\n\n3. **A tall panel at rows 1\u201314, cols 23\u201326** is directly above a 9-bar at **row 15, cols 23\u201326**.  \n   There is another matching 9-bar at **row 26, cols 23\u201326**.  \n   \u2192 Move that panel downward so it docks to the row-26 bar (shift **+11 rows**).\n\nWhen a panel is moved:\n- its **original location is cleared to background 6**,\n- the moved panel **overwrites** whatever is at the destination cells.\n\n#### Step B \u2014 Spread 7 into 5 inside the moved panels\n\nFor each moved panel, perform **two Manhattan-dilation steps** of color 7 into color 5 **within that panel** (0 border stays 0).\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\n```csv\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,9,9,9,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,7,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,5,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,0,5,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,0,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,9,9,9,9\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The ARC Puzzle's Logic**\n\nAlright, after meticulously dissecting the examples, I've got a pretty solid grasp of what's going on. It all boils down to the interaction of black frames, maroon blocks, and the filling of gray pixels with orange.\n\nHere's the gist:\n\n1.  **Frame Movement:** Frames *love* to cozy up to those maroon (9) blocks. If there's a gap, the frame scoots over until it's touching, usually in the direction of the 9s. It's like a magnet, but with 9s! It doesn't matter how long the 9s are.\n\n2.  **Fill it up!** Once the frame and 9s are touching, the magic happens. The gray (5) pixels inside the frame start turning orange (7), but only up to a certain point. The fill amount is determined by *how* far the frame moved. If there was no gap (and no movement), no orange. For each step of movement, add 1 orange layer in the frame, from the side that the 9 is contacting.\n\nApplying this to the Test Input:\n\n*   **Frame 1 (Top-Center):** It's pushed down by the 9 at the bottom. The interior fills, from the bottom up, 1 pixel deep.\n*   **Frame 2 (Left):** It's pulled up by the 9 at the top. The interior fills from the top down, 1 pixel deep.\n*   **Frame 3 (Right Top):** There is nothing that would cause the frame to move and there is already orange. So no change.\n*   **Frame 4 (Right Bottom):** The interior starts at 5 and ends at 7.\n\nSo, construct the output grid using this logic.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Inferred Logic:**\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The grid contains rectangular frames defined by black (0) borders, filled with gray (5) and sometimes orange (7) pixels. There are also maroon (9) bars or lines that act as \"attractors\" or \"targets\". The background is magenta (6).\n2.  **Movement:** Each black frame moves 1 step in the direction of an adjacent maroon (9) block.\n    *   If a frame is above 9s, it moves **Down** 1 step (consuming the 9s).\n    *   If a frame is below 9s, it moves **Up** 1 step.\n    *   If a frame is to the left/right of 9s, it moves right/left.\n    *   In the Test Input, the 9s are generally 1 pixel thick in the direction of movement, which corresponds to a 1-pixel shift.\n3.  **Filling (Orange Injection):** After moving, the interior of the frame fills with orange (7) pixels.\n    *   The source of the \"fill\" is the side of the frame that touched the 9s (the leading edge).\n    *   The **amount** of fill corresponds to the distance moved (1 pixel).\n    *   The fill replaces the first available gray (5) pixel(s) in the scan order from the source side.\n        *   If moving Down (Source Bottom): Scan the bottom-most interior row. Change the first 5 to 7.\n        *   If moving Up (Source Top): Scan the top-most interior row downwards. Change the first 5 to 7.\n        *   Existing orange pixels are skipped; the \"fill\" finds the next available gray space.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Frame 1 (Center Top, cols 11-15):**\n    *   Position: Rows 0-7.\n    *   Adjacent 9s: Row 8 (Bottom).\n    *   **Action:** Move **Down 1** step (to Rows 1-8).\n    *   **Fill:** Source is Bottom. The new interior bottom row is Row 7. It was `0,5,5,5,0`. The interior `5,5,5` becomes `7,5,5` (filling the first pixel).\n*   **Frame 2 (Left, cols 1-7):**\n    *   Position: Rows 13-23.\n    *   Adjacent 9s: Row 12 (Top).\n    *   **Action:** Move **Up 1** step (to Rows 12-22).\n    *   **Fill:** Source is Top. Scan interior from top (Row 13 down).\n        *   Rows 13, 14 (originally 14, 15) are full of 7s.\n        *   Row 15 (originally 16) was `0,7,7,7,7,5,0`. The interior `7,7,7,7,5` becomes `7,7,7,7,7`.\n*   **Frame 3 (Right Top, cols 22-25):**\n    *   Position: Rows 0-13.\n    *   Adjacent 9s: Row 14 (Bottom).\n    *   **Action:** Move **Down 1** step (to Rows 1-14).\n    *   **Fill:** Source is Bottom. Interior is already full of 7s. No change to content.\n*   **Frame 4 (Right Bottom, cols 17-19):**\n    *   Position: Rows 19-25.\n    *   Adjacent 9s: Row 18 (Top).\n    *   **Action:** Move **Up 1** step (to Rows 18-24).\n    *   **Fill:** Source is Top. Scan interior from top (Row 19 down).\n        *   Rows 19-21 (originally 20-22) are `7`.\n        *   Row 22 (originally 23) was `5`. It becomes `7`.\n        *   Row 23 (originally 24) remains `5`.\n*   **Persisting Elements:**\n    *   The maroon 9s at Row 3 (cols 1-8) and Row 14 (cols 17-19) are not touched by any frame, so they persist.\n    *   The 9s that triggered movement are overwritten by the frames.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The core task here is to transform grids containing black frames with colored interiors, focusing on how maroon bars (9s) and existing orange pixels (7s) influence the expansion of gray (5) pixels into orange (7) ones.**\n\nInitially, I'm analyzing the relationships within example grids to understand the underlying logic. A key observation is that the maroon bars seem to act as a source or guide for the orange color. Based on the patterns across examples, and while some frames move, in all instances, existing 7s result in more 7s in the new grid (versus no 7s in the old grid). Therefore, the critical operation is expanding or \"filling\" orange regions within black frames.\n\nMy current working hypothesis: the 9s provide a \"heat\" source or \"directional influence\" for the expansion of orange. Specifically:\n\n1.  I identify frames (black borders).\n2.  I look at adjacent maroon bars (9s).\n3.  I determine the *direction* to expand the orange (down for above 9s, up for below 9s, etc.).\n4.  Then the existing orange regions (7s) propagate in that direction, turning gray (5s) pixels into orange.\n\nIn the test input, I observe a consistent pattern: the frames are adjacent to the maroon bars. I analyze the Test input's frames, and because of existing 7s (at the \"bottom\" or \"9s\" side of a frame, and gravity from the 9s is such that 7s \"fall\" and the 5s fill), the rule \"Replace all 5s with 7s\" is what makes the most sense.\n\nEssentially, I predict that all gray (5) pixels inside a black frame will become orange (7) because of existing 7s and a close proximity of the 9s. I see this as a local rule. The black bars are for containing the transformation.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by applying a rule inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Rule:**\n1.  **Object Identification**: The grid contains rectangular frames outlined in black (`0`). Inside these frames are pixels of gray (`5`) and orange (`7`). There are also maroon (`9`) bars or blocks in the background (magenta `6`).\n2.  **Interaction**: The maroon (`9`) regions act as \"sources\" or \"anchors\". The black frames are positioned adjacent to these maroon markers. In Example 1 and 3, frames move to touch the maroon markers, but in the Test Input, the frames are already touching the maroon markers (either above or below them), so no movement is required.\n3.  **Transformation**: The transformation happens inside the black frames. The gray (`5`) regions are filled with orange (`7`).\n    *   The rule implies an \"expansion\" of the orange color into the gray area.\n    *   In the solved examples, we see that if an orange region exists, it expands to fill the gray area in the direction determined by the maroon markers (e.g., if markers are above, gravity flows down; if below, it flows up).\n    *   Specifically, in Ex 1 (Right), Ex 2, and Ex 3, the presence of orange color combined with the maroon markers results in the gray areas being filled with orange.\n    *   In the Test Input, every frame contains at least some orange (`7`) pixels and is adjacent to a maroon (`9`) marker.\n    *   Therefore, the logic dictates that the orange color should completely fill the gray interior of these frames.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe test input has four frame structures:\n1.  **Top-Middle Frame** (Cols 11-15, Rows 0-7): 9s are below (Row 8). Inside contains 5s and a 7 at the bottom. **Action**: Fill the entire interior (Rows 1-6, Cols 12-14) with 7s.\n2.  **Top-Right Frame** (Cols 22-25, Rows 0-13): 9s are below (Row 14). Inside is already full of 7s. **Action**: No change.\n3.  **Bottom-Left Frame** (Cols 1-7, Rows 13-23): 9s are above (Row 12). Inside has 7s at the top and 5s below. **Action**: Fill the remaining 5s (Rows 17-22) with 7s.\n4.  **Bottom-Right Frame** (Cols 17-19, Rows 20-25): 9s are above (Row 19). Inside has 7s at the top and 5s below. **Action**: Fill the remaining 5s (Rows 23-24) with 7s.\n\n**Result**: All gray (`5`) pixels inside the black (`0`) frames are changed to orange (`7`). The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,9,9,9,9\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,9,9,9,9",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify these transformation patterns:\n\n1. **Frame identification**: Black (0) bordered rectangles contain gray (5) and orange (7) interiors\n2. **Maroon (9) bars**: Act as position markers/guides for frames\n3. **Interior transformation**: Orange (7) regions expand within frames to fill more of the interior, while gray (5) shrinks to the opposite corner\n4. **Expansion pattern**: The 7s flood/expand from their position toward the opposite corner, leaving 5s only in a smaller corner region\n\nAnalyzing the test input frames:\n\n**Frame 1** (rows 0-7, cols 11-15): Has a single 7 at bottom-right (row 6, col 14). The 7 should expand up and left, leaving 5s only in the top-left corner.\n\n**Frame 2** (rows 0-13, cols 22-25): Already all 7s in interior - no change needed.\n\n**Frame 3** (rows 13-23, cols 1-7): Has 7s at top (rows 14-16, with one 5 at row 16, col 6). The 7s expand diagonally downward, with the single 5 marking a diagonal boundary.\n\n**Frame 4** (rows 19-25, cols 17-19): Has 7s at top 2 cells. The 7s expand down, leaving one 5 at the bottom.\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,0,5,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,9,9,9,9\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,0,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,9,9,9,9\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n1. **Find the black rectangular frames** (color `0`).  \n   Each frame encloses a \u201ccavity\u201d made of `5` (gray) and sometimes `7` (orange). The outside background is `6`.\n\n2. **Each frame has a maroon \u201chandle bar\u201d** (color `9`) touching one side of the frame, and **another maroon bar in the same line farther away**.  \n   The frame (and the touching bar) are **translated** so that the touching bar lands exactly on the farther bar.  \n   - This is why frames appear to \u201cslide\u201d up/down/left/right.\n   - The farther maroon bar stays in place (the moved bar overlaps it), while the old location of the moved bar/frame becomes background `6`.\n\n3. **Inside the moved frame, orange expands in a regular packed way.**  \n   Let:\n   - `d` = distance the frame moved (number of cells shifted along that axis),\n   - `k` = number of orange (`7`) cells originally inside the frame cavity,\n   - `A` = cavity area.\n\n   Then the output cavity contains  \n   \\[\n   N=\\min(A,\\;k+d)\n   \\]\n   orange cells.\n\n   These `N` orange cells are then **packed starting from a corner determined by the move direction** (and filling strips parallel to the maroon bar):\n   - move **up** \u2192 pack from **top-left**, row-by-row left\u2192right\n   - move **down** \u2192 pack from **bottom-right**, row-by-row right\u2192left  \n   (Horizontal moves in the examples use analogous column-by-column packing.)\n\nAll other cells (background `6`, unmoved maroon bars `9`, and the frame borders `0`) are preserved.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,7,7,7,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,5,5,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9",

Describe the observable structures**\n\nDescribe what you see **without guessing** the rule:\n\n* What objects exist? (shapes, colors, connected components)\n* How are they arranged? (locations, orientations, bounding boxes)\n* What changes from input to output? (additions, removals, movements)\n* What stays the same? (stable background, preserved shapes)\n\nBe very literal and avoid hypothesizing here.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\nFor each, say \u201cpresent\u201d, \u201cmaybe\u201d, or \u201cabsent\u201d:\n\n* **Object movement**\n* **Object recoloring**\n* **Bordering / outlining**\n* **Filling holes or cavities**\n* **Removing noise / extracting main shape**\n* **Copying / pasting / repositioning**\n* **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**\n* **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**\n* **Size-based filtering or selection**\n* **Symmetry or reflection operations**\n* **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**\n* **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**\n\nThis helps narrow down plausible rule families.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\nList 3\u20136 insights that are **crucial and not immediately obvious**.\nExamples of the kind of insights to extract:\n\n* \u201cOnly the *largest* blue cluster receives a border; smaller ones are ignored.\u201d\n* \u201cNew colors in the output correspond to *inside* regions of hollow shapes.\u201d\n* \u201cThe transformation only acts on objects touching the top edge.\u201d\n* \u201cThe rule depends on which color appears in the **top-left tile** of the input.\u201d\n* \u201cObjects are replaced with templated icons depending on their color.\u201d\n* \u201cInternal holes are treated as objects and recolored independently.\u201d\n\nFocus on the subtle but general behavior.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nIn 2\u20134 sentences, propose a **general transformation mechanism** that would explain the mapping *across inputs and outputs*.\n\nAvoid low-level pixel descriptions; describe conceptual behavior.\n\nExample styles:\n\n* \u201cThe task identifies hollow shapes and outlines them in red while recoloring their interior according to hole depth.\u201d\n* \u201cThe task compresses all meaningful objects to the top-left quadrant while preserving their original shapes.\u201d\n* \u201cAll scattered singletons are deleted and replaced by large structured blocks based on color frequency.\u201d\n\nIf ambiguous, propose the *two or three* most likely rule families.\n\n---\n\n## **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\nGive 3\u20135 quick algorithmic checks for validation, e.g.:\n\n* \u201cVerify whether recoloring depends on hole depth or on adjacency to perimeter.\u201d\n* \u201cCheck if the anchor color is always the top-left non-background pixel.\u201d\n* \u201cTest whether clusters are preserved or converted into icons.\u201d\n* \u201cDetermine whether the largest cluster always receives the transformation.\u201d\n\nThese guide a solver toward the correct general rule.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nIn 3-4 bullet points, give the distilled essence \u2014 short, hard, and generalizable.\n**IMPORTANT: Start this section with the exact line `HINT_START` and end it with the exact line `HINT_END`.**\n\nExample:\nHINT_START\n* The task outlines certain shapes using a new color.\n* Only shapes with internal cavities are processed.\n* Inner cavities receive a secondary recolor distinct from the border.\nHINT_END\n",

Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\nAcross all three pairs:\n\n- **Background:** A solid **magenta** field fills most cells.\n- **Main objects:** Multiple **black-outlined rectangular frames** (axis-aligned). Each frame encloses a **gray** rectangular interior region.\n- **Inner marks:** Some frames contain **orange** rectangles located *inside* the gray interior (not on magenta).\n- **Other objects:** Thin **dark red/maroon** bars/strips (mostly vertical), sometimes adjacent to frames, sometimes isolated on the magenta background.\n\nPer pair (as drawn):\n\n**Pair 1**\n- *Input:* Two black rectangular frames near the top, side-by-side. Left frame: gray interior only. Right frame: gray interior with a small orange mark.\n- *Output:* The same two frames remain. The orange region inside the right frame is **larger/more prominent** than in the input. The left frame\u2019s interior looks largely unchanged (still gray). Dark red strips remain present.\n\n**Pair 2**\n- *Input:* A larger magenta grid with several black frames (at least three) scattered (e.g., one near top-right, one mid-left, one lower area). Only one (lower) frame clearly contains orange; others appear gray-only. Several dark red vertical bars appear on magenta.\n- *Output:* The black frames remain present. **More frames now show orange inside** and/or the orange areas inside frames are **larger** than before. Dark red bars are still present (their exact placement is hard to judge from the sketch).\n\n**Pair 3**\n- *Input:* Two black frames (one smaller near the top area, one wider near the bottom). Orange appears inside at least one frame. Dark red vertical bars appear (notably near bottom-left and near the right side).\n- *Output:* Both frames remain. The orange areas inside the frames look **expanded/cleaner rectangles** compared to the input. Dark red bars remain.\n\n**What clearly changes:** orange regions inside the black frames (size and/or which frames contain orange).  \n**What clearly stays the same:** magenta background; black frame structures; the existence of gray interior regions; dark red bars mostly persist.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- Object movement: **maybe** (some elements\u2019 placement is ambiguous in the sketch)\n- Object recoloring: **present** (gray interiors partly become orange / orange increases)\n- Bordering / outlining: **absent** (black borders already exist; no clear new outline color)\n- Filling holes or cavities: **maybe** (orange appears to \u201cfill\u201d interior areas)\n- Removing noise / extracting main shape: **absent**\n- Copying / pasting / repositioning: **maybe** (orange appears in additional frames)\n- Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center): **maybe** (orange looks more standardized/centered)\n- Using highest-frequency or rarest colors: **maybe** (orange is rare and seems to drive the change)\n- Size-based filtering or selection: **maybe** (only the framed rectangles are affected)\n- Symmetry or reflection operations: **absent/maybe** (not clearly visible)\n- Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion: **present** (orange areas grow/expand)\n- Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping: **absent**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **Edits are confined to the interiors of the black rectangular frames.** The magenta background and the black frame boundaries appear preserved.\n2. **Orange behaves like a \u201cstate\u201d that spreads/expands within a frame\u2019s gray cavity** (orange regions become larger and more regular).\n3. **Multiple frames in the same grid get processed similarly**, suggesting a per-container rule rather than a single global edit.\n4. **Dark red/maroon bars do not get converted into orange** and look mostly unaffected, implying they are either ignored or act only as markers.\n5. **Resulting orange regions are rectangular and axis-aligned**, matching the notion of operating on rectangular interior cavities rather than arbitrary flood-fill into magenta.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nMost likely, the task detects **black-outlined rectangular \u201ccontainers\u201d with gray interiors** and then **creates/expands an orange block inside the gray interior** of each container (possibly turning a small orange seed into a larger standardized fill within that interior).  \nTwo close rule families to consider: (a) **seeded fill**: only containers that already contain orange get their gray interior converted/expanded to orange; (b) **propagation/copy**: the orange pattern is applied to additional similar containers even if they started gray-only.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks to perform when solving\n\n1. **Container detection:** Verify that target regions are exactly the gray interiors enclosed by black rectangles (and that magenta never changes).\n2. **Seed condition:** Check whether a frame must contain at least one orange pixel in the input to receive orange expansion in the output.\n3. **Fill geometry:** Determine whether output orange equals (i) full interior fill, (ii) interior fill leaving a 1-cell gray margin, or (iii) a fixed-size centered rectangle.\n4. **Multi-object consistency:** Confirm the same operation is applied independently to every detected frame in a grid.\n5. **Role of maroon bars:** Test whether maroon strips correlate with which frames get orange or with the placement of the orange block.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* The transformation preserves the magenta background and the black rectangular frames; changes occur inside the frames\u2019 gray cavities.\n* Orange regions inside frames become larger/more regular, suggesting an \u201cexpand/fill interior\u201d operation.\n* Multiple similar framed rectangles are processed in parallel with the same interior rule.\n* Dark red/maroon bars persist and appear non-target (possibly markers), not recolored into orange.\nHINT_END",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing and Executing the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to tackle an ARC task. It seems straightforward enough: grids of numbers (0-9), some examples to learn from, and a new test grid to solve.  The \"Objects Description\" and \"Transformation Description\" are kind of a game-changer; they give me a roadmap, but I have to carefully check if they're actually right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the objects.  Background is magenta (6), containers are bordered by grey (0), and contain a mix of grey (5) and orange (7).  Attachments are linear maroon segments (9).  Sounds pretty standard for ARC colors, but always good to double-check.\n\nThe *really* interesting part is the Transformation:\n\n1.  Detect 0-bordered rectangles (containers).\n2.  Find adjacent maroon (9) segments.\n3.  Move the container towards the attachment.\n4.  Move based on $s$, calculated as the *minimum* of two values:\n\n    *   $F$: The number of interior grey cells (5s) inside the container.\n    *   $L$: \"Steps to the next 9 segment in that direction.\" This is key. It sounds like a distance, but I'll need to figure out *exactly* what this means.\n5.  Shift the *attached* maroon segment by $s$ steps. This part is a bit vague.\n6.  Convert $s$ interior cells from grey (5) to orange (7).\n7.  \"Clockwise directional sweep...\" - This describes the *order* in which to convert the cells.\n\nOkay, let's dive into the examples. Example 1 is my guinea pig.\n\n**Example 1: Deconstructing the Logic**\n\nThe input has a 5x4 rectangle with grey (5) interiors and a maroon (9) block above it.  The output shows the container *shifted right* by one step, with an orange-grey (7/5) interior mix, and the 9s *above* haven't shifted. Hmm.  So, I need to work out why it moved one step.\n\n$F$, the interior 5s, count to 6.  What does L mean? The distance to a 9 segment? Looking at the input, there *is* a 9 block at the *right*, separated by only 1 space. I suspect that L equals 1. If it's the gap distance to the next 9, and the movement is *toward* that nine block, then L=1, then s = min(6,1) = 1. The container moves 1 step. That makes sense.\n\nBut what about that \"shift the attached 9 segment\"? The output doesn't *seem* like it shifted. It looks like it just copied. That part is not yet understood.\n\nThe movement direction is right (toward the nine block). The \"conversion\" starts at the *top-left* corner and does a clockwise sweep, since the direction is to the right. Since s = 1, it convert only one cell. Output: changed.\n\nOkay. Time for another test.\n\nOkay, I re-read. Oh, the nine segment is *pulling* it across. L is a barrier. Not just the distance. The next 9 segment. s = min(F=6, L=1)= 1 step. \n\nOkay, let's keep testing. Let's move onto Example 2.\n\n**Example 2: Refining the Rules**\n\nThe input has a large container with a grey interior on the left, and a maroon attachment on the left and right.  $F=3$. I see a large container. If I go left, I see a maroon(9) at Col 4. The container is at col 10. The gap is 5,6,7,8. Four steps. If I go to the right, there's also an adjacent Nine at index 16.  Gap between Col 9 (attachment) and Col 16. Distance = 7. Let's look at the result. The container moves left. That's a good start. I can tell.  The shift is actually 3, and s = 3. Is that a hint? L = 4. 4 is the number of cells between those 9 segments. $s= \\min(3,4) = 3$. That makes sense. The \"Shift\" of attached 9's *also* gets the same value. So the 9 moved, and the container moved 3 units toward the left. This all seems consistent.\n\nOkay, and now another object. This one has an F of 8. I see that it\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on specific rules governing \"containers\" and their \"attachments\".\n\n### Analysis of the Task\n\n**Objects:**\n1.  **Background:** Color 6.\n2.  **Containers:** Rectangles with border 0, filled with 5 and 7.\n    *   **Rect A (Top-Middle):** Located at Rows 0-7, Cols 11-15.

Within each layer, scan standard reading order (e.g., Left-to-Right).\n\n**Applying Logic to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Rect B (Cols 22-25):** $F=0$. Does not move.\n2.  **Rect D (Cols 17-19):** No adjacent attachment. Does not move.\n3.  **Rect A (Cols 11-15):**\n    *   Direction: **Down**.\n    *   Attachment at R8. Target 9s at R23. Distance $L = 23 - 8 = 15$.\n    *   Interior 5s ($F$): Rect is 6x3 interior. Top 5 rows are 5s (15). Bottom row has two 5s. Total $F = 17$.\n    *   $s = \\min(17, 15) = 15$.\n    *   **Move:** Down 15 steps. New Y range: 15-22.\n    *   **Interior Update:** Convert 15 cells. Scan from Bottom (leading edge) to Top.\n        *   R6 (Bottom): 3 cells converted (2 were 5, 1 was 7).\n        *   R5, R4, R3, R2: All 3 cells converted (12 cells).\n        *   Total so far 14? Wait. R6 had 2 fives. The rule says \"convert 5s\". But example logic implies we iterate cells and flip 5->7 until count met.\n        *   Actually, simpler check: Bottom 5 rows become all 7s. Top row (R1) has 1 cell converted.\n    *   **9s:** Shift R8 -> R23. Merge.\n4.  **Rect C (Cols 1-7):**\n    *   Direction: **Up**.\n    *   Attachment at R12. Target 9s at R3. Distance $L = 12 - 3 = 9$.\n    *   Interior ($F$): Width 5. Height 10.\n        *   R16 has 1 five. R17-23 have 7 rows * 5 = 35 fives. Total $F=36$.\n    *   $s = \\min(36, 9) = 9$.\n    *   **Move:** Up 9 steps. New Y range: 4-15.\n    *   **Interior Update:** Convert 9 cells. Scan from Top (leading edge) Down.\n        *   R14, R15 (All 7): Skip.\n        *   R16 (One 5): Convert. (1 done).\n        *   R17 (Five 5s): Convert all. (6 done).\n        *   R18 (Five 5s): Convert 3 cells (L-R: Cols 2,3,4).\n        *   Remaining cells stay 5.\n    *   **9s:** Shift R12 -> R3.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**1. Task Comprehension & Verification**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to tackle an ARC task. The core is straightforward: a grid goes in, a transformed grid comes out. The key is to figure out the *rule* by studying some examples and then apply that rule to a test case.  The user has given me a head start, basically outlining the algorithm.  My first instinct is to see if this given description actually holds water when compared to the provided examples. If it checks out, great, I can just implement it. If not, then I'll need to figure out how the provided description is wrong, and generate a working version.\n\n**2. Rule Validation & Refinement**\n\nSo, the user said the grids have certain object types like Background, Container, Attachments, with colors 6,0,9 and 5 and 7 inside. And if a container has a 0 border and some adjacent 9s, the containers will move. So step 1. detect all bordered rectangles with 9. Step 2, move the rectangle toward the 9. It appears that the shift amount depends on an object's size and the distance of any next adjacent block.\nI'm diving into the examples. I'm focusing on Example 1 first. Let's see... container is 0-bordered.  Attachment 9s. And then some interior 5s. Right, so the 9s seem to be \"attaching\" and \"pulling\" the rectangles to their positions.\n\nBut something's off in Example 1, or it could be my understanding. The description says the shift amount ($s$) is the minimum of two numbers: $F$ (interior 5s) and $L$ (steps to the next 9 segment). In this Example, the 9s were right next to the rectangle. But the output did not move that large! It only moved by 1 step. That implies either $L$ is 1 or the provided description is partially correct. I have to read the problem more carefully. It seems that \"steps to the next 9 segment\" could be distance to a next *border*? What's going on with the border?\n\nOkay, taking a closer look at that Example 1 and it's a bit more complex than it initially seemed. I'm now looking at the Example, line by line, to see where the container's *actual* border became and how it may connect to the 9s.  It looks like the 9s actually get absorbed into the container. And the container is shifting a bit downward or upward. I'm double-checking the Output and Input to make sure my index is correct. Okay, I'm now certain this is not a one-step move of the attached \"border\". I'm looking at how the \"border\" 0s are transforming on the input and output. The key thing: the interior cells. I'm parsing the *meaning* of what the 5 and 7 cells are. Maybe the position of the 5 and 7 is crucial?\n\nThis shift is determined by the formula: the Minimum of \"F\" (number of interior 5 cells) and \"L\", the number of steps to adjacent 9 segment.  Let's re-read the formula again. Ok, \"L\" should be steps to the \"next\" 9. Ok. This seems to be where the real details and insights of the problem is. Ok so next 9s: the next 9 on a row, or column, after the border. Let's check with this hypothesis, with a bunch of examples.\n\nAfter reading carefully, I'm checking with multiple examples to see the $s$ amount.\n\n* If no other \"next\" 9s existed, the border becomes the end-point. The maximum the container can move is to the border.\n* If a 9 exists, the maximum step is till the containers have no more empty space in between.\n\nI've tested the logic on various shapes, sizes, and orientations in the examples to get the \"correct shift\" values. Ok, I'm thinking the description is partially correct, as it still captures the core intuition. But the details are wrong. The shift happens in the direction with adjacent 9s. That's a huge hint.\n\nNow to the next logic:  The inside changes. A certain number of 5 cells become 7, for the shift. So a 5 to 7.  The description is useful: it's a \"clockwise directional sweep starting at the interior corner facing the movement direction.\" I'm parsing that sentence. Let's see: if you shift up, what cell is changed? Now, I will trace this rule on multiple examples. It's a key part of the transformation.\nOkay, I'\n\nThe transformation follows a consistent physical logic described by the objects and their properties:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   **Containers:** Rectangular areas bordered by color `0`, containing interior cells of `5` and `7`.\n    *   **Attachments:** Lines of color `9` adjacent to one side of the container.\n    *   **Background:** Color `6`.\n\n2.  **Determine Movement for Each Object:**\n    *   **Direction:** The container moves towards the side with the `9` attachment.\n    *   **Distance ($s$):** Calculated as $s = \\min(F, L)$.\n        *   $F$ = Total count of interior `5` cells.\n        *   $L$ = Distance to the next segment of `9`s in the movement direction (or distance to the grid boundary if no other `9`s exist).\n    *   **Constraint:** If $F=0$, the object does not move.\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   **Shift:** Move the container and its attached `9`s by $s$ steps in the determined direction. If the `9`s collide with another `9` segment, they merge.\n    *   **Color Change:** Convert exactly $s$ interior cells from `5` to `7`. The cells are chosen by a clockwise spiral sweep of the interior, starting from the corner that faces the direction of movement (e.g., Top-Left for Up, Bottom-Left for Down/Left logic derived from examples).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Object 1 (Left, Cols 1-8):**\n    *   **Position:** Container at Rows 14-22. Attachment (`9`s) at Row 13.\n    *   **Direction:** **Up**.\n    *   **Stats:**\n        *   Interior `5`s ($F$): Row 17 has 1, Rows 18-21 have 5 each. Total $F = 1 + 20 = 21$.\n        *   Distance to next `9` ($L$): Next `9`s are at Row 3. Distance $13 - 3 = 10$.\n        *   Shift ($s$): $\\min(21, 10) = 10$.\n    *   **Move:** Shift Up 10 steps. New Border at Rows 4-12. Attachment merges at Row 3.\n    *   **Conversion:** Convert 10 cells from `5` to `7`.\n        *   Sweep starts Top-Left (Row 15, Col 2 relative to grid). Top rows (15,16) are `7`s (skip).\n        *   Sweep traverses Right Edge of `5`s (Row 17-21, Col 6) -> 5 cells converted.\n        *   Sweep traverses Bottom Edge (Row 21) -> 4 cells converted.\n        *   Sweep traverses Left Edge (Row 20) -> 1 cell converted.\n        *   Total 10.\n\n*   **Object 2 (Middle, Cols 11-15):**\n    *   **Position:** Container at Rows 0-7. Attachment (`9`s) at Row 8.\n    *   **Direction:** **Down**.\n    *   **Stats:**\n        *   Interior `5`s ($F$): Rows 1-5 have 3 each. Row 6 has 2. Total $F = 15 + 2 = 17$.\n        *   Distance to next `9` ($L$): Next `9`s at Row 23. Distance $23 - 8 = 15$.\n        *   Shift ($s$): $\\min(17, 15) = 15$.\n    *   **Move:** Shift Down 15 steps. New Border at Rows 15-22. Attachment merges at Row 23.\n    *   **Conversion:** Convert 15 cells from `5` to `7`.\n        *   Sweep starts Bottom-Left.\n        *   It converts the outer ring of `5`s and spirals in, leaving only the center cells (Row 2 and 3 of interior) as `5`s.\n\n*   **Object 3 (Right, Cols 22-25):**\n    *   **Position:** Container Rows 0-13. Attachment Row 14.\n    *   **Stats:** Interior contains only `7`s. $F = 0$.\n    *   **Action:** No move.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\n*   Clear background to `6`.\n*   Draw Object 3 in original position.\n*   Draw Object 1 shifted Up 10, with updated interior.\n*   Draw Object 2 shifted Down 15, with updated interior.\n\nOutput Grid:\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,5,5,5,5,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,5,5,5,5,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,5,5,5,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,5,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,5,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6",

Background: Uniform field of color 6.\n2. Containers: Rectangles defined by a border of color 0, filled with internal layers or blocks of color 5 and color 7.\n3. Attachments: Linear segments of color 9 (horizontal or vertical) adjacent to the container borders.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Detect each 0-bordered rectangle on 6 background and its adjacent 9 attachment.  \n- Move the container toward its attachment side by s steps, where s = min(F, L), F = number of interior 5 cells, and L = steps to the next 9 segment in that direction.  \n- Shift the attached 9 segment by the same s; if it overlaps another 9, they merge as 9.  \n- Fill all vacated cells with 6.  \n- Convert exactly s interior cells from 5 to 7, chosen by a clockwise directional sweep starting at the interior corner facing the movement direction.  \n- Containers with F=0 do not move.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Identify 0-bordered containers with their adjacent 9 attachments\n2. Calculate movement distance s = min(F, L) where F = count of interior 5s, L = distance to next 9 segment\n3. Move containers toward their attachments, shifting 9s accordingly\n4. Convert s interior 5s to 7s, filling from the movement direction edge\n\n**Identifying Containers:**\n\n1. **Container 1** (rows 0-7, cols 11-15): Has 9s below at row 8. Interior has 17 5s and 1 7. Moving down, next 9 at row 23. L=15, F=17, s=15.\n\n2. **Container 2** (rows 13-23, cols 1-7): Has 9s above at row 12. Interior has 31 5s. Moving up, next 9 at row 3. L=9, F=31, s=9.\n\n3. **Container 3** (rows 0-13, cols 22-25): Has 9s below at row 14. All interior is 7s, F=0, doesn't move.\n\n4. **Container 4** (rows 19-25, cols 17-19): Has 9s above at row 18. Interior has 3 5s. Moving up, next 9 at row 14. L=3, F=3, s=3.\n\n**Applying Transformations:**\n\n- **Container 1**: Moves from rows 0-7 to rows 15-22. Convert 15 5s to 7 (from bottom row up). 2 5s remain in top row.\n\n- **Container 2**: Moves from rows 13-23 to rows 4-14. Convert 9 5s to 7 (from top down). Interior becomes mostly 7s with some 5s remaining in lower portion.\n\n- **Container 3**: No movement (F=0).\n\n- **Container 4**: Moves from rows 19-25 to rows 16-22.

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred rule from the solved examples\n\n1. **Find each \u201ccontainer\u201d**: an axis-aligned rectangle whose **border is color 0** and which sits on the **background color 6**.  \n2. For each container, find its **attached 9-segment**: a straight line of color **9** directly adjacent to one side of the container (touching the border).\n3. Let:\n   - **F** = number of **interior cells equal to 5** (inside the 0-border).\n   - If **F = 0**, the container **does not move**.\n   - Otherwise, look from the attached 9-segment further in the same direction and find the **next 9-segment**; let  \n     **L** = distance (in grid steps) from the attached 9-segment to that next 9-segment.\n   - **s = min(F, L)**.\n4. **Translate** the whole container by **s** cells **toward the attachment side**, and also translate the **attached 9-segment** by the same **s**.  \n   If the shifted 9 overlaps existing 9, it simply **merges** (stays 9).\n5. **Fill vacated cells with 6**.\n6. **Interior recoloring**: convert exactly **s** interior cells **5 \u2192 7**, chosen by a clockwise sweep:\n   - pick the interior corner depending on direction:  \n     **up \u2192 top-left**, **right \u2192 top-right**, **down \u2192 bottom-right**, **left \u2192 bottom-left**.\n   - order interior cells by **increasing Manhattan distance** from that corner; for ties, follow the **clockwise** direction implied by the move.\n   - convert the first **s** cells in that order that are **5**.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test grid (containers found)\n\n- **Container at rows 1\u20138, cols 12\u201316** (has 17 interior 5s), attached **below** by a 9-line at row 9, next 9-line at row 24:  \n  \\(F=17,\\ L=15,\\ s=15\\).

Move **up 9** to rows **5\u201315**, move the 9-line to row **4** (merges).

Attachments: Linear segments of color 9 (horizontal or vertical) adjacent to the container borders.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Detect each 0-bordered rectangle on 6 background and its adjacent 9 attachment.  \n- Move the container toward its attachment side by s steps, where s = min(F, L), F = number of interior 5 cells, and L = steps to the next 9 segment in that direction.  \n- Shift the attached 9 segment by the same s; if it overlaps another 9, they merge as 9.  \n- Fill all vacated cells with 6.  \n- Convert exactly s interior cells from 5 to 7, chosen by a clockwise directional sweep starting at the interior corner facing the movement direction.  \n- Containers with F=0 do not move.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred rule (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find each container**: a rectangle whose **border is color 0**, on a **background of 6**.  \n   Its **interior** contains colors **5 and/or 7**.\n\n2. **Find its attachment**: a straight segment of **9** that is **flush-adjacent to exactly one side** of the 0-border.  \n   That side defines the **movement direction** (toward the 9s).\n\n3. **Compute the movement amount**\n   - \\(F\\) = number of **interior** cells that are **5** (fuel).\n   - Find the **next** 9-segment further in the same direction (same alignment).  \n     \\(L\\) = distance (in grid steps) from the **attached** 9-segment to that **next** 9-segment.\n   - \\(s = \\min(F, L)\\)\n\n4. **Move**\n   - Shift the entire 0-bordered rectangle (border + interior) **by \\(s\\)** toward the attachment.\n   - Shift the attached 9-segment by the same \\(s\\).

                "response": "**Deconstructing the Visual Language of the Grids**\n\nOkay, here's how I see this. I started by zeroing in on the task: describe the *types* of objects, not the relationships or any kind of underlying rules. So, I need to stay within the boundaries of a visual description.\n\nFirst, I looked at the grids. It's clear that there's a consistent background, color 6. That's simple enough. Then, I quickly noticed recurring rectangular structures. These rectangles are the core building blocks. They have a color 0 border, and their interiors are filled with colors 5 and 7. The important thing is that these colors aren't randomly distributed; they form blocks or layers within these rectangular shapes. Sometimes it's just one color, like solid 7, but often, it's a mix.\n\nNext, there's a distinct linear element, color 9, that always seems to be adjacent to these rectangular objects. They look like \"pipes\" or \"connectors\". They extend out from the rectangles, into the background.\n\nSo the main elements are the background, the rectangular containers, and the linear pipes. The containers have a border (0) and internal regions (5 and 7). The pipes are lines (9). My primary objective is to make sure this description is concise and objective, devoid of any interpretations about the system's behavior. I can't talk about gravity or liquid levels, just the arrangement of colors.\n\n\nBased on the visual data provided in the grids, the objects can be categorized as follows:\n\n**1. The Background**\n*   The entire field on which other objects are placed is composed of a uniform field of color 6.\n\n**2. Rectangular Containers**\n*   **Structure:** These are rectangular shapes of varying dimensions (height and width).\n*   **Border:** Each rectangle is defined by a distinct perimeter/border made of color 0.\n*   **Interior Content:** The area enclosed by the color 0 border is filled with blocks of color 5 and color 7.\n    *   These internal colors often appear as solid layers or sections.\n    *   In many instances, the colors are stacked (e.g., a block of color 7 resting on a block of color 5), or the interior may consist entirely of one of these two colors.\n\n**3. Linear Attachments**\n*   **Appearance:** These are straight lines extending horizontally or vertically.\n*   **Color:** They are exclusively color 9.\n*   **Placement:** These lines are spatially attached to the exterior of the Rectangular Containers. They abut the color 0 border and extend outwards into the color 6 background.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Uniform field of color 6.\n2. Containers: Rectangles defined by a border of color 0, filled with internal layers or blocks of color 5 and color 7.\n3. Attachments: Linear segments of color 9 (horizontal or vertical) adjacent to the container borders.\n</objects_summary>",

Background: Uniform field of color 6.\n2. Containers: Rectangles defined by a border of color 0, filled with internal layers or blocks of color 5 and color 7.\n3. Attachments: Linear segments of color 9 (horizontal or vertical) adjacent to the container borders.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Detect each 0-bordered rectangle on 6 background and its adjacent 9 attachment.  \n- Move the container toward its attachment side by s steps, where s = min(F, L), F = number of interior 5 cells, and L = steps to the next 9 segment in that direction.  \n- Shift the attached 9 segment by the same s; if it overlaps another 9, they merge as 9.  \n- Fill all vacated cells with 6.  \n- Convert exactly s interior cells from 5 to 7, chosen by a clockwise directional sweep starting at the interior corner facing the movement direction.  \n- Containers with F=0 do not move.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
