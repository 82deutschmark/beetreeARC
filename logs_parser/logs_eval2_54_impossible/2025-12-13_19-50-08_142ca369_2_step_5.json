            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's the game plan:** I've got to crack this ARC puzzle by figuring out a transformation rule, and it's all about analyzing examples and then applying what I learn to a test case.\n\n**First Example: Deep Dive**\n\n*   **Structure:** I see a 20x20 grid with colored shapes. Some shapes seem to have 'target' locations, and the transformation seems to have something to do with the initial shape extending towards the target. The initial structure looks like a corner.\n*   **Coordinate Crunching:** Getting down to specifics, I carefully trace pixel coordinates. The inputs are given as a list of numbers; I'm mapping numbers to grid positions to figure out what each object is and how it's shaped.\n*   **Diagonal Motion:** I notice these shapes are forming diagonal lines in the output, maybe extending from the original spot towards a target. The output shows new lines in each position.\n*   **Source and Target:** I identify what I'm calling \"source\" shapes and \"target\" single pixels. The output is clearly changing the position of the source.\n\nI see that the source shape moves and ends up making a diagonal until it reaches the target. It seems like the pixel in the corner of the shape is key to forming these diagonals.\n\n*   **Further Analysis:** I'm seeing patterns of diagonal lines, sometimes forming an 'X'. I need to map the changes pixel by pixel between the input and output. I'm focusing on trying to find the key pixel which is causing the change.\n\n**Example Two: More Data**\n\nThis is an opportunity to look at a new set of data. This looks more complicated; it seems like objects interact with each other in a more sophisticated way. It appears there may be collision events or reflections around walls. The key seems to be aligning the input with the output.\n\n**Refining the Theory**\n\nI'm starting to think the shapes act as a source that \"shoots\" diagonal \"beams\" towards their targets. The beams don't stop; they continue and \"reflect\" off of the grid boundaries in some cases. My core hypothesis is that these beams follow diagonal paths, the beams reflect along one axis.\n\n*   **Reflection Hypothesis:** With some further research into the examples, I can see these beams bounce. Each source object has at least one associated target object (same color). The beam goes from the source pixel to the target pixel and then *continues*! The result in output shows diagonals running in two directions.\n\n**Test Case: Time to Solve**\n\nThe Test Input is my target. There are symmetric shapes to test this new theory!\n\n*   **Object Identification:** The input data features different colors and positions (7s and 6s).\n*   **Mirroring and Beams:** I am trying to visualize how the source \"shoots\" a beam. I am noticing symmetry, a common theme with ARC problems. There seem to be mirror-like reflections going on.\n*   **Coordinate Verification:** I am checking to see that the source's beams do extend to the target as I had anticipated in the theory. I also think I have figured out what part of the shape is responsible for the movement; the corner pixel.\n*   **Extension Hypothesis:** I think I see a pattern in where the beams go. It makes it easier to predict what is going to happen in the output. It looks like the beams continue past the original target.\n\n**Refined Rule:** I am going to form this rule:\n\n1.  Identify source shapes and associated target.\n2.  Draw diagonal lines from key pixel to the aligned point of the target.\n3.  Draw extension to account for reflection past the target.\n4.  If one beam occupies the other, then the first one to occupy is the one that is there.\n5.  Draw only the direct paths and extensions.\n\n**Result Construction:** I take the Test Input and will add to it based on my derived rules.\n\n\nThe transformation rule inferred from the examples is as follows:\n1.  **Identify \"Shooter\" and \"Target\" objects:** The grid contains source objects (often corners or small shapes) and target objects (often single pixels or bars) of the same color.\n2.  **Cast Diagonal Beams:** From the \"tip\" or inner-most pixel of each source object, cast a diagonal beam (at 45 degrees) towards the target object. The beam consists of pixels of the same color as the source.\n3.  **Beam Reflection/Extension:**\n    *   In Example 1, beams reflected symmetrically around the vertical column of the target. However, in the Test Input, the arrangement is already symmetric (sources on both left and right). The \"reflection\" of the left beam corresponds to the path of the right beam (and vice-versa). Thus, no new reflections are drawn; the beams simply travel their direct paths.\n    *   **Extension:** When a beam reaches its target, it extends one pixel further in the vertical direction of travel (e.g., if traveling downwards, it extends one row down; if upwards, one row up).\n4.  **Handling Collisions:** The beams stop when they hit the target object (or merge with it). The extension fills the empty space immediately beyond the target.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Top-Left (Orange 7):** Source at (1,1). Target is the vertical orange bar at column 8 (top part). The beam travels diagonally down-right from (1,1) to (8,8).\n    *   Path: (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7).\n    *   Extension: From (8,8) down to (9,8).\n*   **Top-Right (Magenta 6):** Source at (1,17). Target is the vertical magenta bar at column 10 (top part). The beam travels diagonally down-left from (1,17) to (8,10).\n    *   Path: (2,16), (3,15), (4,14), (5,13), (6,12), (7,11).\n    *   Extension: From (8,10) down to (9,10).\n*   **Bottom-Left (Magenta 6):** Source at (18,1). Target is the vertical magenta bar at column 8 (bottom part). The beam travels diagonally up-right from (18,1) to (11,8).\n    *   Path: (17,2), (16,3), (15,4), (14,5), (13,6), (12,7).\n    *   Extension: From (11,8) up to (10,8).\n*   **Bottom-Right (Orange 7):** Source at (18,17).

            "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, here's my thought process as I tackle this ARC task. The user wants me to solve this. I need to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n\n**1. Initial Assessment & Example Analysis:**\n\nThe task seems to involve a transformation of input grids, where I need to figure out the underlying pattern or rule. I'll start by thoroughly analyzing the provided examples.  My focus is on understanding the relationship between the input and the output. I'm looking for shapes, objects, their positions, and how they change. In Example 1, I noticed L-shapes and isolated pixels and I'm looking at their color and positional relationship.  I'm trying to identify if there are some basic pattern like \"rotate\", \"translate\" or something similar. I check if there is some connection between isolated pixels. The L shapes are on the left and form a diagonal pattern. The isolated pixels form a vertical line. I'm thinking if the vertical line transforms to another figure. The output seems to show diagonal lines extending from the isolated pixels, and I'm tracing them to see how they interact with the original L-shapes. The isolated pixels are the emitter and each color corresponds to different L shapes. I will check the isolated pixels at column 10 to see if it makes some pattern. The output shows new diagonal patterns of the same color as the source pixel. I noticed the rays split and the rays are \"reflecting\" off the original shapes. I'm exploring the geometry of how the rays travel, focusing on slopes, starting points, and how they interact with the existing objects in the grid.\n\n**2. Identifying Core Rules & Patterns:**\n\nI'm looking closely at how the output is derived and what are the key elements. It appears that the single pixels act as \"emitters,\" casting rays that interact with the L-shapes. This seems to be the foundation. I'm trying to figure out the exact path the rays follow and if the are there some general rules. Then I'm trying to build the ray patterns by connecting each emitter to its color L-shape. The beam from emitter hits L-shape and reflects. I'm trying to derive the rules that define each example. The diagonal rays are emitted upwards. Then it splits to two diagonal rays. I'm checking the offsets of emission from the single pixel to find the general patter or formula. I'm carefully charting the coordinates and distances to identify any consistent pattern, possibly related to the emitter's position, the target shape, and the final ray's path. Is it always the same color? I'm trying to understand why it splits and if there is a way to calculate the slope of reflected beam.\n\n**3. Generalization & Hypothesis Building:**\n\nCan I apply the concepts I've learned to other situations? I'm trying to formulate a general rule for this task, so that it can be reused. From Example 1, my hypothesis is that the isolated pixels act as \"emitters\" casting rays to their corresponding same-color shapes. These rays are a combination of a vertical straight segment and diagonal lines. The straight segment's length is determined by the emitter and target shape Y position.  The rays always aim for a specific \"corner\" pixel of the target shape. They seem to stop at the same-colored shapes or reflect. I'm trying to see if this reflects Ex 2 and Ex 3.\n\n**4. Testing & Verification:**\n\nNow I'll test my hypothesis with the other provided examples to see if I can derive a general rule. In Example 2, I'm verifying my \"emitters and targets\". Here, I see the rule may be more complex. I'm comparing the inputs in Ex 1 and Ex 2 to find any different components. The Example 2 involves \"matching\" shapes rather than point-to-shape interaction and the goal is to cast rays between matching objects in the input and that the color is preserved along the rays. Is that the generalized pattern? I see the rays can reflect off a vertical axis. Let's see if this applies for Example 3.\n\n**5. Building a Robust Solution:**\n\nI'm checking the color patterns. I will identify the different components in the inputs and the relationships and directions of the object. Vertical lines are emission source. Horizontal lines are reflection. I'm thinking of building a system to convert each vertical component and horizontal components into ray and make them interact. In Example 3, The rule is that each \"Line\" object will act as an emission source. Each object will be the origin of a diagonal ray. The intersection will transform the color. Each ray's slope is related to the orientation and direction of the shape. If Vertical, the top emits. If Horizontal, the left emits. Each color's ray starts at a line and its path is defined by a 45 degree slope. I'm\n\nThe transformation involves casting \"beams\" or \"rays\" from the central vertical lines (emitters) towards the L-shaped objects (targets) in the corners of the grid. The process is defined by the following rules inferred from the examples:\n\n1.  **Identify Emitters and Targets**:\n    *   **Emitters**: The vertical lines of length 3 in the center of the grid act as the source of the rays.\n        *   Top-Left (Yellow 7): Line at `(6-8, 8)`.\n        *   Top-Right (Magenta 6): Line at `(6-8, 10)`.\n        *   Bottom-Left (Magenta 6): Line at `(11-13, 8)`.\n        *   Bottom-Right (Yellow 7): Line at `(11-13, 10)`.\n    *   **Targets**: The L-shaped objects in the four corners matching the color of the nearest emitter.\n\n2.  **Determine Ray Origin and Direction**:\n    *   Rays originate from the end of the emitter line that is vertically closest to the target.\n        *   Top Emitters start from their top pixel (row 6).\n        *   Bottom Emitters start from their bottom pixel (row 13).\n    *   The ray travels horizontally first to establish a diagonal path to the target. It calculates the horizontal distance needed such that the remaining distance to the target is a perfect diagonal (slope 1 or -1).\n        *   **Top-Left (7)**: Origin `(6,8)`. Target center approx `(1,1)`. Ray moves Left to `(6,6)`. Then Diagonally Up-Left.\n        *   **Top-Right (6)**: Origin `(6,10)`. Target center approx `(1,17)`. Ray moves Right to `(6,12)`. Then Diagonally Up-Right.\n        *   **Bottom-Left (6)**: Origin `(13,8)`. Target center approx `(18,1)`. Ray moves Left to `(13,6)`. Then Diagonally Down-Left.\n        *   **Bottom-Right (7)**: Origin `(13,10)`. Target center approx `(18,17)`. Ray moves Right to `(13,12)`. Then Diagonally Down-Right.\n\n3.  **Draw the Rays (Split/Reflection)**:\n    *   At the point where the horizontal segment turns diagonal (the \"elbow\"), the ray splits into a \"V\" shape (reflection).\n    *   **Branch 1 (Towards Target)**: Goes diagonally towards the corner shape until it is adjacent to the shape.\n    *   **Branch 2 (Away/Reflection)**: Goes diagonally in the opposite vertical direction (reflecting off the horizontal axis of the elbow) until it hits the grid edge.\n\n    **Calculated Points:**\n\n    *   **Top-Left (Yellow 7)**:\n        *   Straight: `(6,7)`, `(6,6)`\n        *   To Target: `(5,5)`, `(4,4)`, `(3,3)`, `(2,2)`\n        *   Reflection: `(7,5)`, `(8,4)`, `(9,3)`, `(10,2)`, `(11,1)`, `(12,0)`\n\n    *   **Top-Right (Magenta 6)**:\n        *   Straight: `(6,11)`, `(6,12)`\n        *   To Target: `(5,13)`, `(4,14)`, `(3,15)`, `(2,16)`\n        *   Reflection: `(7,13)`, `(8,14)`, `(9,15)`, `(10,16)`, `(11,17)`, `(12,18)`, `(13,19)`\n\n    *   **Bottom-Left (Magenta 6)**:\n        *   Straight: `(13,7)`, `(13,6)`\n        *   To Target: `(14,5)`, `(15,4)`, `(16,3)`, `(17,2)`\n        *   Reflection: `(12,5)`, `(11,4)`, `(10,3)`, `(9,2)`, `(8,1)`, `(7,0)`\n\n    *   **Bottom-Right (Yellow 7)**:\n        *   Straight: `(13,11)`, `(13,12)`\n        *   To Target: `(14,13)`, `(15,14)`, `(16,15)`, `(17,16)`\n        *   Reflection: `(12,13)`, `(11,14)`, `(10,15)`, `(9,16)`, `(8,17)`, `(7,18)`, `(6,19)`\n\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0\n0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0\n0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,6,0\n7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0",

Where different colored diagonals would overlap at column 9 (the center gap), those cells remain 0\n\nFor the test input:\n- 7s are at: top-left L-shape, center-top vertical (col 8), center-bottom vertical (col 10), bottom-right L-shape\n- 6s are at: top-right L-shape, center-top vertical (col 10), center-bottom vertical (col 8), bottom-left L-shape\n\nThe diagonals connect:\n- Top-left 7 \u2194 center-top 7 \u2194 (through gap) \u2194 bottom-right 7\n- Top-right 6 \u2194 center-top 6 \u2194 (through gap) \u2194 bottom-left 6\n- Center-bottom 7 \u2194 top-left 7 (via up-left diagonal)\n- Center-bottom 6 \u2194 top-right 6 (via up-right diagonal)\n\n```\n0,7,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,6,0\n7,7,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,6,6\n0,7,7,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,6,6,0\n6,0,7,7,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,6,6,0,7\n0,6,0,7,7,0,7,0,6,0,7,0,6,0,6,6,0,7,0\n0,0,6,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,0,6,0,6,6,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,7,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,6,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,6,0,6,0,0,0,7,0,7,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,6,0,6,0,7,0,6,0,7,0,7,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,6,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,7,7,0,0\n0,6,6,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,7,7,0\n6,6,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n```",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Task Breakdown and Example Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task involving grids of integer color representations. The core seems to be about tracing colored shapes and connecting them somehow, likely with diagonal lines, based on a series of examples and a test input. It's time to dive into these examples. My initial instinct is to look for recurring patterns or rules that govern how the input shapes map to the output grids.\n\n**Deep Dive into Example 1**\n\nExample 1 is a good place to start. I'm noting the various L-shaped and single-pixel shapes. It's clear from the output image that lines connect them, but I need to understand the mechanism. I'm focusing on tracing these lines, paying close attention to their color, starting points, and directions. The single pixels on the right side immediately grab my attention as potential 'bounce' points or mirrors for the lines. I start meticulously checking the text representations of the grids. It seems these lines are behaving like they are hitting a horizontal mirror.\n\nAs I start to trace the paths of these lines, I see \"V\" patterns. This further reinforces my 'reflection' hypothesis: lines travel diagonally from the shapes, hit a single pixel, and then reflect diagonally in the other direction.\n\n**Example 2: A Shift in Dynamics**\n\nExample 2 throws a curveball. The single pixels of Example 1 are gone, and the \"targets\" are more complicated shapes. This is where I start wondering if the \"reflection\" angle is affected by other shapes in the grid, or if it changes the color or the type of beam that is reflected. Looking at the output, I start to suspect that the task might be \"Connect Shapes of the Same Color\", which leads to my idea of starting a \"laser beam\" from a shape and having the beam connect another shape of the same color, hitting obstacles or avoiding them on the way. The beam seems to be a combination of several diagonal steps. It's a bit more complex, and I need to deduce how this beam chooses its direction.\n\n**A Promising Hypotheses and Refinement**\n\nFrom there, I come up with a refined theory: Shapes \"shoot\" colored beams, which can reflect off other shapes or \"mirrors.\" If the colors of two beams are the same, they \"connect\". I start to see \"sources\" that create the beam and \"mirrors\" that dictate the reflection angle. I then look for a method of choosing which beam that I should first follow. As I go to Example 3, I am thinking that the beam direction is affected by the position of other shapes. If the beam hits a mirror of another color, the color of the beam changes. The edge of the grid becomes a mirror.\n\n**Test Input: Putting the Theory to the Test**\n\nNow, it's time to test my understanding on the Test Input and identify the source shapes, the mirrors, and trace paths. This involves a lot of coordinate checking and figuring out where the \"beams\" go. The test input is complex, with shapes that seem to \"crossover\". I think it is important to trace each shape in order to have the most reasonable answer. The shape complexity of the test input requires me to identify potential reflection or connection points, and to decide the sequence and color transformations. I work out the paths for the colors, making adjustments when a beam encounters another color. I make sure that the shapes connect where they are supposed to.\n\n**Final Solution Generation**\n\nI meticulously reconstruct the output grid, setting each pixel's color based on the traced beam paths, applying the connectivity and color change rules. The challenge is in the coordinates, but with a refined method, I can produce the solution step by step. I carefully identify the intersections and try to build the final answer by connecting all the dots. I finally check it to be sure. I believe the beam connection logic in my plan will work for similar, more complex problems.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, I analyzed the provided examples to determine the rules for connecting the colored shapes.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Beams and Connections:** The puzzle involves connecting colored shapes (\"sources\" and \"targets\") with lines of pixels (\"beams\").\n2.  **Beam Direction:**\n    *   **Start:** Beams originate from specific points on the source shapes.\n        *   L-shapes at the top (like in Example 1 and Example 3) emit beams diagonally downwards from their \"inner\" corner or an extremity. Specifically, the top-left L-shape emits downwards-right. The top-right L-shape emits downwards-left.\n    *   **Traversal:** Beams travel diagonally (slope 1 or -1) through empty space.\n    *   **Vertical Segments:** If two shapes are vertically aligned and close to each other (as seen with the central bars in the Test Input), the beam travels vertically between them.\n3.  **Interaction with Shapes:**\n    *   **Hit:** When a beam hits a shape, it connects to it.\n    *   **Color Transformation:** The beam takes the color of the *source* it originated from. If it hits a new shape of a different color, the *next* segment of the beam (emitted from that shape) takes the color of the *new* shape. This is consistent with Example 3 (Yellow beam hits Blue shape -> Blue beam emerges).\n4.  **Test Input Pattern:**\n    *   **Top Left (TL):** Orange (7) L-shape. Emits an Orange beam diagonally Down-Right.\n    *   **Top Right (TR):** Pink (6) L-shape. Emits a Pink beam diagonally Down-Left.\n    *   **Middle Structures:** A pair of vertical bars. Left is Orange (7), Right is Pink (6).\n    *   **Lower Structures:** A pair of vertical bars, shifted down. Left is Pink (6), Right is Orange (7). Note the color swap compared to the middle.\n    *   **Bottom Left (BL):** Pink (6) L-shape.\n    *   **Bottom Right (BR):** Orange (7) L-shape.\n\n**Applying the Transformation to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Path 1 (Orange Start):**\n    *   **Segment 1:** Starts from the TL Orange L-shape at `(0,1)`. Travels diagonally Down-Right.\n        *   Path: `(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7)`.\n        *   Target: It hits the Middle Orange vertical bar at `(7,8)`.\n    *   **Segment 2:** The beam travels from the Middle Orange bar to the Lower Pink bar directly below it. Since they are vertically aligned (Column 8), the connection is vertical.\n        *   Source: Bottom of Middle Orange bar `(8,8)`.\n        *   Target: Top of Lower Pink bar `(11,8)`.\n        *   Path: `(9,8), (10,8)`.\n        *   Color: The beam comes from an Orange shape, so these pixels are **Orange (7)**.\n    *   **Segment 3:** The beam hits the Lower Pink bar `(11,8)`.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**General Approach to ARC Task: Line Extension**\n\nMy task is to solve an ARC problem where the output grids contain lines emanating from shapes, often connecting shapes of the same color. Analyzing the examples, I see a pattern of extending lines from objects (L-shapes, bars, dots) until they reach a boundary or another line.\n\n**Key Observations and Insights:**\n\n*   **Color-Based Connections:** Lines predominantly connect objects of the same color.\n*   **Diagonal Lines:** The lines are frequently diagonal, with slopes of either 1 or -1.\n*   **\"Bouncing\" Behavior (in some examples):** Lines may not directly connect but appear to bounce off a central point, forming a \"V\" shape, or zig-zag through.\n*   **Starting Point:** Lines originate from a specific point of the shape, often the \"corner\" (like the bottom-right for an L-shape) or an endpoint of a bar.\n*   **\"Targeting\" Logic:**  It seems lines are \"aimed\" toward another same color object.\n*   **Example-Specific Analysis:**  I'm taking each example's input, observing it with detail, making and testing hypothesis:\n\n    *   **Example 1 (Basic Connection):** Lines extend from L-shapes diagonally towards a dot, bouncing off the dots column to create V-shaped patterns. It appears the lines intersect or \"bounce\" off an invisible central line.\n    *   **Example 2 (Complex Chain):** Lines extend from bars and connect them, often through a zigzag.\n    *   **Example 3 (Object Blocking):** Lines from L-shapes seem to stop or divert when encountering an object.\n\n**Hypotheses & Refinements:**\n\n*   **Object Type:** Different objects require different extension points, with corners of L-shapes being important.\n*   **Targeting Logic is Essential:** The output is constructed around what object the path is going towards.\n*   **Central Lines:** Maybe all paths use the center column as a central pivot point.\n*   **Side Wall Bounces are Likely:** If all lines share the same center, they can't all fit. Some should connect to side walls to prevent overwrites.\n*   **No Line Overwrite:** Since they are integers, one shape cannot overwrite another. If this happens, a new path must be created to avoid this.\n\n**Approach for Test Input (and Beyond):**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Determine the locations and colors of all the objects (L-shapes, bars).\n2.  **Establish Connections:** Figure the rules for which objects connect (same color).\n3.  **Trace Lines:** From the L-shapes, I extend lines based on the geometry of the input grid and look for the connections.\n4.  **Bouncing Logic:** If I find a place where objects connect by bouncing, I apply this to my rules.\n5.  **Output:** Fill the grid with the extended lines, taking into account any collisions or overlaps.\n\n\nThe objective of this task is to connect colored shapes using diagonal lines. Based on the solved examples, the pattern is:\n1.  **Identify Source and Target Objects**:\n    *   In Example 1, L-shapes on the left connect to single pixels on the right.\n    *   In Example 2, shapes connect to form a chain.\n    *   In Example 3, L-shapes connect to bars.\n    *   The connection is always a diagonal line (slope 1 or -1).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule**:\n    *   Find the \"inner corner\" or the vertex of the L-shape that points towards the target.\n    *   Draw a diagonal line from that vertex towards the target object.\n    *   The line stops when it hits the target object.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\nThe input has a 180-degree rotational symmetry.\n*   **Orange Objects**:\n    *   Top-Left L-shape with corner at `(1,1)`.\n    *   Top-Center Vertical Bar ending at `(8,8)`.\n    *   Bottom-Center Vertical Bar starting at `(11,10)`.\n    *   Bottom-Right L-shape with corner at `(18,17)`.\n*   **Magenta Objects**:\n    *   Top-Right L-shape with corner at `(1,17)`.\n    *   Top-Center Vertical Bar ending at `(8,10)`.\n    *   Bottom-Center Vertical Bar starting at `(11,8)`.\n    *   Bottom-Left L-shape with corner at `(18,1)`.\n\n**Connections:**\n1.  **Top-Left Orange Path**:\n    *   Start at L-corner `(1,1)`.\n    *   Target is Top-Center Bar at `(8,8)`.\n    *   Path: `(2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7)`. The next pixel `(8,8)` is part of the bar.\n\n2.  **Bottom-Right Orange Path**:\n    *   Start at L-corner `(18,17)`.\n    *   Target is Bottom-Center Bar at `(11,10)`.\n    *   Path: `(17,16), (16,15), (15,14), (14,13), (13,12), (12,11)`. The next pixel `(11,10)` is part of the bar.\n\n3.  **Top-Right Magenta Path**:\n    *   Start at L-corner `(1,17)`.\n    *   Target is Top-Center Bar at `(8,10)`.\n    *   Path: `(2,16), (3,15), (4,14), (5,13), (6,12), (7,11)`. The next pixel `(8,10)` is part of the bar.\n\n4.  **Bottom-Left Magenta Path**:\n    *   Start at L-corner `(18,1)`.\n    *   Target is Bottom-Center Bar at `(11,8)`.\n    *   Path: `(17,2), (16,3), (15,4), (14,5), (13,6), (12,7)`. The next pixel `(11,8)` is part of the bar.\n\nThe central area between the bars (rows 9-10) is a potential crossing point. However, a direct diagonal bridge would cause a collision at `(9,9)` or `(10,9)`. Following the pattern of Example 3 where lines stop at the target, we only draw the lines connecting the L-shapes to the nearest bars.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs mainly **add 45\u00b0 diagonal (slope \u00b11) pixel runs**, creating large zigzag/chevron/diamond-like structures.\n* **Input objects stay in place**; the transformation is largely **constructive** (adds connectors) rather than moving/recoloring.\n* The new structure behaves like a **single traced path with turns at specific objects** (often bar-shaped), sometimes yielding symmetry/loop-like forms.\n* **Colors of added segments vary by segment**, indicating color is chosen based on which input object/node the segment corresponds to.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**The Strategy for This ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack this ARC puzzle.  It looks like I need to figure out how the program transforms one grid (the input) into another (the output), based on a few examples.  I've got a handle on the first one, and now I'm onto the second, which is a bit more complex. My thought process is organized like this:\n\n**Initial Assessment**\n\nI'm starting by looking for any patterns in the examples. The goal is to come up with a rule that applies to all of them.\n\n**Analyzing Example 1**\n\nIn Example 1, the input has distinct \"shapes\" (blobs of the same color) and \"anchors\" (single pixels). It seems like the transformation draws a path from each anchor to its corresponding shape. The paths aren't straight; they take a turn, reflecting off a conceptual \"wall\" (the right-most column). So, it goes up one step vertically, and then diagonally upward.\n\n**Analyzing Example 2**\n\nExample 2 is trickier. It doesn't have the single-pixel anchors like Example 1. Instead, it seems to have pairs of shapes, and the output connects them, but not directly. The shapes are matched by color, like (5s go to 5s, etc.), and the transformation draws paths. Now, I suspect this transformation forms a loop.\n\n**Identifying the Logic**\n\nOkay, I've got a hypothesis.  The basic principle here seems to be \"constructive\": existing input objects stay put, and we add elements. I'm guessing \"diagonal pixel runs\" are added to connect the input objects. I think it is important to remember the hints like \"Traced Path\" and \"Slop +-1\", and \"turns\".\n\n**Deep Dive into Example 2**\n\nIn Example 2, there are shapes of 5s, 4s, and 2s that need to be connected. I'm focusing on \"nodes\" (objects) in a single trace, so I can ignore irrelevant pixels. There are also 6s along the edges; those are probably important. Example 2 seems to involve multiple shapes, and I have a feeling that there are paths for each color that might \"intersect\". In Ex 2 I realized that some of these \"intersection\" objects are crucial.\n\n**Testing the Hypothesis**\n\nOkay, I'm starting to visualize a process. I think the key here is to \"trace\" diagonal paths between specific points on these shapes.  The hint \"slope of + or - 1\" confirms my diagonal path suspicion. The path will \"turn\" when it hits a shape (I'm using this as a definition for the term \"turn\") or a reflective object. I keep in mind the idea that a path should be a \"continuous single-traced path,\" and I see symmetry and the zigzag (diamond) hint that reinforces a \"loop-like\" solution. This led me to develop the hypothesis that this problem needs to be split up into different colors (as they have in example 1),\n\n**Shaping a Concrete Strategy**\n\nBased on symmetry and structure, I've formed a plan:  I think I can solve this by drawing a diagonal \"X\" across the image, with one line of color 7 and another line of color 6. I'm pretty sure that this solution will also work with the \"turns at a specific object\" strategy,\n\n**Implementation Details**\n\nI believe this transformation can be implemented as follows:\n1.  Identify the two diagonals on the grid.\n2.  Fill pixels on those diagonals.\n3. Apply to output, so I don't \"draw over\" existing items.\n\n**Final Check**\n\nI have a feeling that this is the solution, and that this problem can be expressed with a \"draw-over\" problem rather than a set of complex rules. Now, I need to double-check that this is correct on the Test Input.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid by identifying a pattern from the examples and applying it to the test input.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Examples:**\n    *   **Example 1:** Shows \"anchor\" pixels at the bottom emitting vertical lines that turn into 45-degree diagonals to connect to shapes at the top-left. The color of the connecting line matches the shape and the anchor.\n    *   **Example 2:** Shows pairs of shapes connected by diagonal zigzag paths. The paths seem to connect specific endpoints of the shapes.\n    *   **Example 3:** Shows a chain of connections: Yellow (Top-Left) $\\to$ Blue (Center) $\\to$ Orange (Left) $\\to$ Grey (Bottom). The connections are single-pixel wide diagonal lines. The color of the line corresponds to the source shape.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Test Input:**\n    *   **Objects:**\n        *   Four corner clusters:\n            *   Top-Left (TL): Orange (7) at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\n            *   Top-Right (TR): Magenta (6) at (0,17), (1,17), (1,18).\n            *   Bottom-Left (BL): Magenta (6) at (18,0), (18,1), (19,1).\n            *   Bottom-Right (BR): Orange (7) at (18,17), (18,18), (19,17).\n        *   A central \"cross\" structure made of four vertical bars:\n            *   Center-TL: Orange (7) bar at col 8, rows 6-8.\n            *   Center-TR: Magenta (6) bar at col 10, rows 6-8.\n            *   Center-BL: Magenta (6) bar at col 8, rows 11-13.\n            *   Center-BR: Orange (7) bar at col 10, rows 11-13.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The arrangement is highly symmetric. The 7s are on the main diagonal (TL to BR), and the 6s are on the anti-diagonal (TR to BL).\n\n3.  **Hypothesis:**\n    *   The transformation involves drawing diagonal lines connecting the corresponding corner shapes to the central structure, forming a large \"X\".\n    *   **Orange (7) Path:** Connects TL to BR along the main diagonal ($y = x$). This path will pass through (or graze) the Center-TL and Center-BR bars.\n    *   **Magenta (6) Path:** Connects TR to BL along the anti-diagonal ($y = -x + 19$). This path will pass through (or graze) the Center-TR and Center-BL bars.\n\n4.  **Path Tracing:**\n    *   **Orange (7):**\n        *   Starts at TL (1,1) (part of the shape).\n        *   Ends at BR (18,18) (part of the shape).\n        *   Path follows $r = c$.\n        *   It passes through (8,8), which is the bottom tip of the Center-TL bar.\n        *   It passes near the Center-BR bar (at col 10). Specifically, at row 11, the path is at (11,11), adjacent to the top of the Center-BR bar at (11,10).\n    *   **Magenta (6):**\n        *   Starts at TR (1,18) (part of the shape).\n        *   Ends at BL (18,1) (part of the shape).\n        *   Path follows $r + c = 19$.\n        *   It hits the Center-BL bar top at (11,8).\n        *   It passes near the Center-TR bar (at col 10). Specifically, at row 8, the path is at (8,11), adjacent to the bottom of the Center-TR bar at (8,10).\n\n5.  **Construction:**\n    *   Fill pixels $(r, c)$ with **7** where $r = c$ for $2 \\le r \\le 17$. (Skipping the corners themselves which are already set, though overwriting is fine).\n    *   Fill pixels $(r, c)$ with **6** where $r + c = 19$ for $2 \\le r \\le 17$.\n    *   The center pixels (9,9), (10,10) become 7.\n    *   The center pixels (9,10), (10,9) become 6.\n    *   These lines cross without sharing pixels.\n\n**Output Generation:**\n\n*   **Orange (7) Diagonal:** (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7), (8,8)[exist], (9,9), (10,10), (11,11), (12,12), (13,13), (14,14), (15,15), (16,16), (17,17).\n*   **Magenta (6) Diagonal:** (2,17), (3,16), (4,15), (5,14), (6,13), (7,12), (8,11), (9,10), (10,9), (11,8)[exist], (12,7), (13,6), (14,5), (15,4), (16,3), (17,2).\n\nNote: (8,8) is already 7. (11,8) is already 6. (18,1) is 6. (1,18) is 6. (1,1) is 7. (18,18) is 7.\n\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Understanding:**\n\nOkay, the user wants me to solve an ARC task, likely some kind of image transformation or pattern recognition based on examples. I'll need to analyze the provided examples thoroughly, identify the underlying rules, and apply them to the test input. My approach will be a step-by-step breakdown: first, meticulously examine the examples to identify any patterns or relationships between the input and output grids; second, formulate a hypothesis about the transformation; and finally, test that hypothesis against the given examples and apply it to the test input to produce a solution.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples - Example 1:**\n\nAlright, let's dive into Example 1. It seems like the core concept revolves around shapes, colors, and some kind of line generation.\nI see four \"L-shaped\" objects of different colors arranged diagonally. There's also a vertical column of single-colored pixels (the 'spine') near the middle of the grid.\nThe output shows that the original L-shapes are preserved and are now connected by diagonal lines. Each line appears to originate from an object and \"reflects\" off a central vertical axis defined by the column of pixels. The color of each line corresponds to the starting object.\nAha! The reflection seems to be the key to connecting all the objects. The lines trace out V-shapes. The vertices of the V-shapes are either at a \"guide\" pixel of the same color or the center column. So it's \"connect to object, or center-column if there's no object\".\n\n**Analysis of Example 2:**\n\nExample 2 presents a different configuration. There's a vertical bar, a horizontal bar, and an L-shape that looks disconnected. The output looks more like a continuous path or loop connecting all these different shapes.\nThe path snakes its way through the shapes, connecting them diagonally. The color of the line appears to be split between the colors of the connected shapes. Now it appears the connections are between the objects, and there's no reflection column.\n\n**Developing a Unifying Hypothesis:**\n\nSo, there has to be a unifying principle behind the seemingly different structures in both examples. My thinking is, the \"connect line-of-sight neighbors diagonally\" hypothesis. Perhaps the algorithm is drawing diagonal lines (45 degrees) from the corner endpoints of the objects until they hit another object.\n\n**Testing Hypothesis and Applying to the Test Input:**\n\nWith this principle, I can construct the test input solution by drawing Orange lines from the Orange L-shape and Magenta lines from the Magenta L-shape. The lines should connect at the vertical object in the center.\n\nI've got it! My solution involves preserving the input objects, and drawing diagonal lines (45 degrees) between corresponding endpoints. Where diagonals don't perfectly connect, use vertical lines of same origin color. The color of the line is determined by the starting object.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we need to infer the rules for drawing connecting lines between the objects present in the grid.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Objects and Placement:** The inputs contain colored objects (L-shapes, bars). The output preserves these objects and adds lines connecting them.\n2.  **Line Trajectory:** The lines are primarily 45-degree diagonals (slopes +1 or -1). In Example 2 and 3, when objects are aligned vertically or horizontally with short gaps, straight lines are used.\n3.  **Connectivity:** The structure forms a single continuous path or symmetrical paths. The lines connect specific \"connector\" points on the objects (usually the endpoints or inner corners of shapes).\n4.  **Color Rule:** A line segment connecting Object A to Object B takes the color of Object A (the source object). This creates a directed flow where the path expands from the starting objects. In Example 3, a yellow object connects to a blue object with a yellow line, and a blue object connects to a red object with a blue line.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Dimensions:** 20 rows, 19 columns.\n*   **Objects Identified:**\n    *   **Top Left (TL):** Orange (7) L-shape at `(0,1), (1,0), (1,1)`. Connector at `(1,1)`.\n    *   **Top Right (TR):** Magenta (6) L-shape at `(0,17), (1,17), (1,18)`. Connector at `(1,17)`.\n    *   **Middle Left (ML):** Orange (7) vertical bar at `(6,8)-(8,8)`.\n    *   **Middle Right (MR):** Magenta (6) vertical bar at `(6,10)-(8,10)`.\n    *   **Middle Bottom Left (MB_L):** Magenta (6) vertical bar at `(11,8)-(13,8)`.\n    *   **Middle Bottom Right (MB_R):** Orange (7) vertical bar at `(11,10)-(13,10)`.\n    *   **Bottom Left (BL):** Magenta (6) L-shape at `(18,0)-(19,1)`. Connector at `(18,1)`.\n    *   **Bottom Right (BR):** Orange (7) L-shape at `(18,17)-(19,17)`. Connector at `(18,17)`.\n\n*   **Logic for Connections (Flow from Top to Bottom):**\n    1.  **TL to ML:** Connect `(1,1)` to `(8,8)` with an **Orange** diagonal `(+1, +1)`.\n    2.  **TR to MR:** Connect `(1,17)` to `(8,10)` with a **Magenta** diagonal `(+1, -1)`.\n    3.  **ML to MB_L:** The gap between `ML` (bottom `8,8`) and `MB_L` (top `11,8`) is vertical. Connect with a vertical line. Since the source `ML` is Orange, the line is **Orange**.\n    4.  **MR to MB_R:** The gap between `MR` (bottom `8,10`) and `MB_R` (top `11,10`) is vertical. Connect with a vertical line. Since the source `MR` is Magenta, the line is **Magenta**.\n    5.  **MB_L to BL:** Connect `MB_L` (junction `11,8`) to `BL` (target `18,1`). Source `MB_L` is Magenta, so use a **Magenta** diagonal `(+1, -1)`.\n    6.  **MB_R to BR:** Connect `MB_R` (junction `11,10`) to `BR` (target `18,17`). Source `MB_R` is Orange, so use an **Orange** diagonal `(+1, +1)`.\n\n**Calculated Pixels:**\n*   **Orange Diagonal (TL->ML):** `(2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7)`.\n*   **Magenta Diagonal (TR->MR):** `(2,16), (3,15), (4,14), (5,13), (6,12), (7,11)`.\n*   **Orange Vertical (ML->MB_L):** `(9,8), (10,8)`.\n*   **Magenta Vertical (MR->MB_R):** `(9,10), (10,10)`.\n*   **Magenta Diagonal (MB_L->BL):** `(12,7), (13,6), (14,5), (15,4), (16,3), (17,2)`.\n*   **Orange Diagonal (MB_R->BR):** `(12,11), (13,12), (14,13), (15,14), (16,15), (17,16)`.\n\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs mainly **add 45\u00b0 diagonal (slope \u00b11) pixel runs**, creating large zigzag/chevron/diamond-like structures.\n* **Input objects stay in place**; the transformation is largely **constructive** (adds connectors) rather than moving/recoloring.\n* The new structure behaves like a **single traced path with turns at specific objects** (often bar-shaped), sometimes yielding symmetry/loop-like forms.\n* **Colors of added segments vary by segment**, indicating color is chosen based on which input object/node the segment corresponds to.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\nFrom the examples, I observe:\n1. L-shaped objects at corners and bar-shaped objects in the middle act as \"waypoints\"\n2. 45\u00b0 diagonal lines connect matching colors from corners through the bars\n3. Original elements stay in place; new diagonals are added\n4.

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs mainly **add 45\u00b0 diagonal (slope \u00b11) pixel runs**, creating large zigzag/chevron/diamond-like structures.\n* **Input objects stay in place**; the transformation is largely **constructive** (adds connectors) rather than moving/recoloring.\n* The new structure behaves like a **single traced path with turns at specific objects** (often bar-shaped), sometimes yielding symmetry/loop-like forms.\n* **Colors of added segments vary by segment**, indicating color is chosen based on which input object/node the segment corresponds to.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find the \u201cemitter\u201d objects:**  \n   In every example, the objects that *emit* a drawn path are the **3\u2011cell L-shapes** (a 2\u00d72 block with one missing corner).  \n   Each such L-shape has a unique **corner cell** (the one touching the other two cells orthogonally).\n\n2. **Launch a 45\u00b0 diagonal \u201cray\u201d from the corner into the empty quadrant:**  \n   The L-shape has two arms; the ray starts from the corner and goes diagonally **away from the arms** (into the missing quadrant).  \n   The ray\u2019s initial color is the L-shape\u2019s color.\n\n3. **Ray motion and turning (bouncing) rule:**  \n   The ray moves one step at a time in its current diagonal direction `(dr, dc)` where `dr,dc \u2208 {\u00b11}`.\n   After stepping into a new cell, look at the two **orthogonal neighbor cells in the ray\u2019s forward directions**:\n   - vertical forward neighbor: `(r+dr, c)`\n   - horizontal forward neighbor: `(r, c+dc)`\n   \n   If either of those contains a **non\u2011zero input pixel**, the ray \u201cbounces\u201d off it:\n   - If the horizontal neighbor is non-zero \u2192 flip `dc`.\n   - If the vertical neighbor is non-zero \u2192 flip `dr`.\n   - The ray\u2019s **current color becomes that neighbor\u2019s color**.\n   - The **turning cell** (the current cell) is colored with this (possibly new) color.\n\n4. **Stopping:**  \n   The ray continues until the next diagonal step would leave the grid.\n\n5. **Output:**  \n   The output is the original grid plus all ray-traced cells from all L-shaped emitters.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\nThe test grid contains **four 3\u2011cell L-shapes** (at the four corners), so we trace **four rays**.  \nEach ray bounces once off the nearest vertical bar it encounters and then exits at an edge.  \nCombining all rays with the unchanged original pixels yields the grid below.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Outputs mainly **add 45\u00b0 diagonal (slope \u00b11) pixel runs**, creating large zigzag/chevron/diamond-like structures.\n* **Input objects stay in place**; the transformation is largely **constructive** (adds connectors) rather than moving/recoloring.\n* The new structure behaves like a **single traced path with turns at specific objects** (often bar-shaped), sometimes yielding symmetry/loop-like forms.\n* **Colors of added segments vary by segment**, indicating color is chosen based on which input object/node the segment corresponds to.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\nThe outputs can be explained as **ray-tracing on the grid along 45\u00b0 diagonals**:\n\n1. **Keep all input pixels in place** (no moving/recoloring of existing objects).\n2. Treat certain input objects as **\u201cnodes\u201d hit by a ray**. The ray moves only on diagonals (slope \u00b11).\n3. When a ray is travelling, it **paints every visited empty cell** with the ray\u2019s current color.\n4. A ray **does not enter** an occupied cell. Instead, if the **next diagonal step** would land on a non\u2011zero cell, the ray:\n   - **reflects** (turns) depending on the hit object\u2019s orientation:\n     - hitting a **vertical bar** reflects left\u2194right (flip the column direction),\n     - hitting a **horizontal bar** reflects up\u2194down (flip the row direction).\n   - continues from the current cell in the new diagonal direction.\n5. The behavior in the examples is constructive and produces large diagonal runs; with multiple border components, you get multiple diagonal \u201carms\u201d.\n\nFor the test grid, the only meaningful reflectors are the **vertical 3\u2011pixel bars** (at columns 8 and 10). The corner L-shapes sit on the border and act as starting \u201csources\u201d; each launches a diagonal ray inward, which then reflects off the nearest vertical bar, creating the long zigzagging diagonals seen in the examples.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0  \n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6  \n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0  \n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \n6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7  \n0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0  \n0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,7,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0  \n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0  \n0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0  \n7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6  \n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0  \n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7  \n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\n### Pair 1\n**Input 1**\n- Background is entirely black.\n- Near the upper-left area there is a small \u201cstair-step/diagonal\u201d arrangement made of four small connected components in **gray, red, blue, green** (each component is only a few pixels).\n- In the central area there are **four isolated single pixels** (not touching each other), stacked vertically in one column: **gray** above **red** above **blue** above **green**.\n\n**Output 1**\n- Background remains black.\n- The small colored components near the upper-left remain present.\n- Many new pixels appear, forming multiple **long diagonals** (45\u00b0 / slope \u00b11). These diagonals create a **large chevron / nested \u201cV\u201d-like** structure spanning much of the grid.\n- The colors used in these diagonals are the same set (**gray, red, blue, green**). The previously isolated single pixels are no longer seen as isolated; their positions are now part of (or replaced by) larger diagonal structures.\n\n---\n\n### Pair 2\n**Input 2**\n- Background is black.\n- Several separated colored components exist:\n  - **Magenta** vertical bars touching the **left** and **right** edges.\n  - **Gray** vertical bars (one near the upper region, one near the lower region).\n  - **Yellow** horizontal bars (one in the upper-left interior, one in the lower-right interior).\n  - Multiple **red** small hooked/L-like components near the center.\n\n**Output 2**\n- Background remains black.\n- The original colored components are still visible, but there are many added pixels forming a prominent **diagonal/diamond-like** framework (diagonals of slope \u00b11).\n- The added pixels reuse the same colors present in the input; the new diagonals visually link or run between several of the original components, producing a larger structured pattern around a central black region.\n\n---\n\n### Pair 3\n**Input 3**\n- Background is black.\n- Separated components:\n  - A **yellow** 2\u00d72 block at the **top-left corner**.\n  - An **orange** vertical bar touching the **left edge** (mid-height).\n  - A **blue** vertical bar in the upper interior.\n  - A **red** horizontal bar in the upper-right interior.\n  - A **gray** horizontal bar in the lower interior.\n\n**Output 3**\n- Background remains black.\n- All original components remain in place.\n- New pixels are added as **diagonal lines** (slope \u00b11) that run between several of the existing components, creating a **multi-segment zigzag**. Where a diagonal meets a bar, the bar can appear to gain a small perpendicular \u201cstub\u201d due to overlap/attachment.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement:** maybe (original objects look stationary, but there may be duplication/extension effects)\n- **Object recoloring:** absent (colors appear preserved; no clear color swaps)\n- **Bordering / outlining:** maybe (some outputs form border-like diamond/chevron structures)\n- **Filling holes or cavities:** absent (central black regions stay unfilled)\n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** absent\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** maybe (some structures look like repeated/extended versions of input motifs)\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center):** present (corner/edge-touching items strongly correlate with large output structure)\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** absent / not evidenced\n- **Size-based filtering or selection:** absent / not evidenced\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations:** maybe (outputs 1\u20132 look partially symmetric)\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** present (objects are \u201cgrown\u201d into long diagonals)\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** maybe (bars look \u201cT/H\u201d-like after attachments, but could be incidental)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **Most newly added pixels lie strictly on 45\u00b0 diagonals (slope \u00b11)**, producing long straight diagonal runs rather than axis-aligned extensions.\n2. **Original components generally remain where they were**, and the transformation mostly **adds** pixels that attach to them, instead of translating or recoloring them.\n3. The added diagonals form **coherent multi-segment structures** (chevrons/zigzags/diamond-like loops) rather than independent short extensions\u2014suggesting a **path/tracing process** through multiple \u201cnodes.\u201d\n4. **Segment colors are not uniform**: different parts of the new diagonal structure use different input colors, implying **color selection depends on which object/phase** of the structure is being drawn.\n5. Edge/corner objects (e.g., the **top-left yellow block** in Pair 3, edge magenta bars in Pair 2) appear to be **structurally important**, correlating with where large diagonal structures start/end or \u201cturn.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nA likely rule family is **diagonal path construction**: the task builds one or more long **45\u00b0 diagonal paths** that run between existing colored components, creating zigzags/chevrons/diamond-like loops while keeping the original objects in place. The path appears to **change direction at certain encountered objects** (often bars), and the **color of each drawn segment** is tied to one of the objects involved at that stage (e.g., the object being departed from or contacted).  \n\nAlternative close family: a **ray/beam tracing** mechanism where a diagonal \u201cbeam\u201d travels, **turns/refects** when it hits horizontal vs vertical bars, and the output is the traced beam colored by the sequence of hit objects.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks to perform when solving (validation-oriented)\n\n1. **Line test:** Verify every newly added pixel belongs to a diagonal line (constant `r-c` or `r+c`) between two salient objects or between an object and a boundary.\n2. **Path continuity:** Check whether the output\u2019s added pixels form **one continuous polyline/cycle** (single trail) versus multiple independent diagonals (one per object/color).\n3. **Turning rule:** At each \u201ccorner\u201d in the added structure, test whether the turn coincides with an input object, and whether the turn depends on **object orientation** (horizontal vs vertical bar).\n4. **Color assignment:** Determine whether each segment\u2019s color matches the **previous node**, the **next node**, or the **node at the turning point**.\n5. **Start/stop conditions:** Identify if the process starts from a **special anchor** (corner-most object, edge-touching object, unique shape) and whether it stops at borders or forms a closed loop (as suggested by Pair 2).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* Outputs mainly **add 45\u00b0 diagonal (slope \u00b11) pixel runs**, creating large zigzag/chevron/diamond-like structures.\n* **Input objects stay in place**; the transformation is largely **constructive** (adds connectors) rather than moving/recoloring.\n* The new structure behaves like a **single traced path with turns at specific objects** (often bar-shaped), sometimes yielding symmetry/loop-like forms.\n* **Colors of added segments vary by segment**, indicating color is chosen based on which input object/node the segment corresponds to.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **Background:** Color 0 field.\n2.  **L-Shaped Polyominoes:** 3-pixel clusters in a 2x2 footprint; various orientations; colors include 3, 4, 6, 7.\n3.  **Orthogonal Lines:** Contiguous horizontal or vertical segments (typically length 3); colors include 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n4.  **Diagonal Lines:** Chains of diagonally adjacent single pixels extending across the grid; colors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n<transformation_summary>\n- Keep all original non-0 pixels (objects) fixed; only add new pixels on 0 background.\n- Add 45\u00b0 diagonal lines (steps of \u00b11 row, \u00b11 col) using the emitting object\u2019s color (1/2/3/4/5/6/7).\n- For each 3-pixel L-shape, start from its elbow and extend in the diagonal direction opposite its missing 2\u00d72 corner; for each length-3 orthogonal segment, start from an endpoint and extend in a chosen diagonal direction.\n- Diagonals grow until the next step would leave the grid or hit a non-0 cell; they stop before collisions (no overwriting).\n- Junctions between diagonals/objects are formed by ending diagonals diagonally-adjacent; the junction cell may be owned by the \u201cnext\u201d color, causing the previous diagonal to stop 1 cell earlier.\n- Special case (example 1): for each single pixel of color c, create a junction 1 cell above it; connect the matching L-shape to that junction by a diagonal, then emit a second diagonal of color c from the junction to the grid boundary.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the user wants me to solve an ARC task, likely involving some pattern recognition based on input/output pairs. The prompt suggests a 'special case' dealing with diagonals from L-shapes, but I can't jump to conclusions. I'll need to dissect the examples to build a working hypothesis and then generalize it.\n\n**Example 1: Initial Hypothesis and Refinement**\n\nLooking at Example 1, I see L-shapes and isolated single pixels, and it's suggesting diagonals are created. My initial thought is that the isolated single pixels are targets that diagonals reach. Specifically, I'm thinking about those \"L\" shapes and how they're related to these pixel targets. The task mentions a connection to a junction, so I should be looking for it. I trace the output and confirm a bouncing diagonal pattern. It is confirmed to emit from the elbow (opposite direction of the arms.)\n\n**Example 2: Expanding the Rule**\n\nExample 2 introduces more complex shapes: a vertical line of pixels, a horizontal line, and some L-shapes. It is suggesting that the \"Special rule\" does not apply, and I have to develop a more general rule. There aren't single-pixel targets here, so I need to adapt. I begin by hypothesizing that lines may be involved. And, lines might influence the emission of diagonals. After some work, I decide that the emission occurs from both of the line's endpoints and follows a clockwise or counterclockwise motion in the grid. However, I decide to develop a separate, more general concept: *Reflection*.\n\n**Formulating the Reflection Rule**\n\nThe example 2 helps me to formulate this new concept. The *L-shapes still emit their diagonals*. I realize that lines might *reflect* the diagonal beams. The reflection is essentially bouncing the beam off of the line and continuing it in a consistent fashion. I now have to work out the reflection physics. I hypothesize that horizontal lines will do a vertical reflection and vertical lines do a horizontal one. The \"junction\" cells will be the points of reflection. I also consider what happens when those beams collide - perhaps a conflict of colors.\n\n**Test Input and Hypothesis Validation**\n\nThe \"Test Input\" is a very organized pattern of L-shapes at the corners, and vertical lines in the center. I should find it is easy to generate the reflection behavior. I now have the following rules for output generation: 1) Diagonals are launched from L-shapes to lines, 2) when the diagonals hit, they are reflected off the line. So the core data is the coordinates.\n\n**Generating Output**\n\nI start by tracing the L-shape diagonals, then compute the coordinates of the \"reflected\" diagonals and create a final coordinate map for each of the test inputs. I check for any collisions/issues, but no problems occur and all of the data matches perfectly. I have a complete picture of the solution.\n\n**Final Data and Implementation**\n\nFinally, I generate a final set of coordinates that correspond to the desired output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid by adding diagonal lines. The transformation rules inferred from the solved examples are:\n1.  **L-Shaped Polyominoes act as Emitters:** Each L-shape has an \"elbow\" and a \"missing corner\" in its 2x2 bounding box. It emits a diagonal line from the elbow in the direction opposite to the missing corner.\n    *   Example: Top-Left L-shape (missing top-left corner) emits Down-Right.\n2.  **Lines/Objects act as Reflectors:** If an emitted diagonal hits another object (specifically, a line of the same color) such that it would collide with it in the next step, it stops at the adjacent cell (forming a junction) and \"reflects\".\n3.  **Reflection Rule:**\n    *   If a diagonal hits a vertical line from the side, the horizontal direction of the diagonal is inverted (e.g., Down-Right becomes Down-Left).\n    *   If a diagonal hits a horizontal line/pixel from above/below, the vertical direction is inverted (e.g., Down-Right becomes Up-Right).\n4.  **Preservation:** Original non-zero pixels remain unchanged. Diagonals stop if they hit the grid boundary.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Top-Left L-shape (Color 7):**\n    *   Elbow at (1,1). Missing corner at (0,0) (Top-Left).\n    *   Emits **Down-Right** (+1 row, +1 col).\n    *   Target path: (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7).\n    *   At (7,7), the next cell would be (8,8), which is part of the vertical Color 7 line at (6,8)-(8,8). More precisely, (7,7) is adjacent to (7,8) (part of the line).\n    *   **Action:** Reflect off the vertical line (Left side).\n    *   Incoming: Down-Right. Reflected: **Down-Left** (+1 row, -1 col).\n    *   New path from (7,7): (8,6), (9,5), (10,4), (11,3), (12,2), (13,1), (14,0).\n\n*   **Top-Right L-shape (Color 6):**\n    *   Elbow at (1,17). Missing corner at (0,18) (Top-Right).\n    *   Emits **Down-Left** (+1 row, -1 col).\n    *   Target path: (2,16), (3,15), (4,14), (5,13), (6,12), (7,11).\n    *   At (7,11), it is adjacent to the vertical Color 6 line at (6,10)-(8,10) (specifically adjacent to (7,10)).\n    *   **Action:** Reflect off the vertical line (Right side).\n    *   Incoming: Down-Left.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **Background:** Color 0 field.\n2.  **L-Shaped Polyominoes:** 3-pixel clusters in a 2x2 footprint; various orientations; colors include 3, 4, 6, 7.\n3.  **Orthogonal Lines:** Contiguous horizontal or vertical segments (typically length 3); colors include 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n4.  **Diagonal Lines:** Chains of diagonally adjacent single pixels extending across the grid; colors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n<transformation_summary>\n- Keep all original non-0 pixels (objects) fixed; only add new pixels on 0 background.\n- Add 45\u00b0 diagonal lines (steps of \u00b11 row, \u00b11 col) using the emitting object\u2019s color (1/2/3/4/5/6/7).\n- For each 3-pixel L-shape, start from its elbow and extend in the diagonal direction opposite its missing 2\u00d72 corner; for each length-3 orthogonal segment, start from an endpoint and extend in a chosen diagonal direction.\n- Diagonals grow until the next step would leave the grid or hit a non-0 cell; they stop before collisions (no overwriting).\n- Junctions between diagonals/objects are formed by ending diagonals diagonally-adjacent; the junction cell may be owned by the \u201cnext\u201d color, causing the previous diagonal to stop 1 cell earlier.\n- Special case (example 1): for each single pixel of color c, create a junction 1 cell above it; connect the matching L-shape to that junction by a diagonal, then emit a second diagonal of color c from the junction to the grid boundary.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis of the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking about this ARC task. The user wants me to solve it, and it seems like it's a grid-based problem with colors and patterns. The input is a 20x20 grid, and I need to figure out how objects within that grid transform into a new output grid. I've got to decode the rules of this visual language.\n\nFirst, I see there are L-shapes, vertical and horizontal lines, and backgrounds of black (0). Based on the examples, the shapes \"shoot\" diagonal lines, which is interesting.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the L-shapes have three colored pixels, the color of which defines the ray. There are also single pixels. The diagonals are linked to the position of the \"elbow\" of the shape. The missing corner dictates the \"opposite direction\" of the diagonal's emission. Single pixels seem to create a \"wall\" or \"mirror\" for the ray. When the ray hits the central column of single pixels, it bounces. In other words, \"Special case... for each single pixel of color c, create a junction 1 cell above it; connect the matching L-shape to that junction by a diagonal, then emit a second diagonal of color c from the junction to the grid boundary\".\n\nHowever, Examples 2 and 3 don't have this single-pixel business, so I need to find a more general rule. In Example 2, the vertical and horizontal lines have a new diagonal pattern to follow. They also emit diagonal lines.\n\nReading the prompt again: \"For each 3-pixel L-shape, start from its elbow and extend in the diagonal direction opposite its missing 2\u00d72 corner\". \"For each length-3 orthogonal segment, start from an endpoint and extend in a chosen diagonal direction\".\n\nSo lines also \"shoot\" from an endpoint. It seems that the line emits from its end that is exposed. These shooting lines should intersect.\n\nIn Example 3, there's a simple L-shape (4), which emits the same. I'll need to figure out exactly how the lines' diagonals interact with each other and the L-shape (4). The key to this task lies in defining consistent rules about orientation and intersection.\n\nSo, here's my emerging understanding:\n1.  **L-shapes:** Shoot diagonal rays that are *opposite* the missing corner of their 2x2 bounding box.\n2.  **Orthogonal lines:** Emit diagonals from one endpoint.\n3.  **The goal:** Ensure the diagonal lines interconnect or converge in a meaningful way.\n    The rule about orthogonal lines is: Shoot from one end and extend in a chosen diagonal direction.\n\nThe key is that the diagonals seem to be creating a visual narrative within the grid. This means I've got to look for intersection points, junctions, and how the shape and line structures connect to define this \"grid story\". It's like deciphering a set of visual instructions. I'm going to formulate a general algorithm:\n\n1.  Identify all L-shapes and orthogonal lines.\n2.  L-shapes: Project a beam diagonally outwards.\n3.  Orthogonal lines: Project a diagonal from the \"outer\" end of the lines outwards.\n\nThe rays are meant to intersect. I can formulate these principles using the example inputs. I see that the rays can intersect. The key to the puzzle appears to define rules for how these diagonals emit rays, either from a \"free\" end of a shape (like a line), or from a \"bound\" elbow of an L-shape. The goal is to construct a consistent set of transformations.\n\nI'll proceed by breaking down the individual shapes in the provided test input and follow through.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we analyze the behavior of the \"L-shaped\" objects and \"Line\" objects in the provided examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **L-Shaped Polyominoes:** These objects emit diagonal lines from their \"elbow\" (the corner of the L) in the direction opposite to the missing corner of their 2x2 bounding box. These diagonals extend until they hit another object or the grid boundary.\n2.  **Orthogonal Lines:** These objects also emit diagonal lines from one of their endpoints. The direction and endpoint seem chosen to either connect with other objects or diverge symmetrically outwards, often perpendicular to the incoming diagonals from L-shapes.\n3.  **Connectivity:** A key pattern is that the diagonals form a connected network. L-shapes shoot inwards towards lines, and lines shoot outwards/inwards to complete the structure or connect to other regions.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe test input contains four L-shapes in the corners and four vertical lines in the center.\n-   **L-shapes:**\n    -   Top-Left (Color 7): Elbow at (1,1), direction South-East. Path towards center.\n    -   Top-Right (Color 6): Elbow at (1,17), direction South-West. Path towards center.\n    -   Bottom-Left (Color 6): Elbow at (18,1), direction North-East. Path towards center.\n    -   Bottom-Right (Color 7): Elbow at (18,17), direction North-West. Path towards center.\n\n-   **Vertical Lines:**\n    -   Top Pair: Color 7 at (6,8)-(8,8) and Color 6 at (6,10)-(8,10).\n    -   Bottom Pair: Color 6 at (11,8)-(13,8) and Color 7 at (11,10)-(13,10).\n\n**Transformation Steps:**\n1.  **L-shape Diagonals (Inwards):**\n    -   **TL (7):** Shoots SE from (1,1). It hits the Top-Left Vertical Line (7) at (8,8). The diagonal fills cells (2,2) through (7,7).\n    -   **TR (6):** Shoots SW from (1,17). It hits the Top-Right Vertical Line (6) at (8,10). The diagonal fills cells (2,16) through (7,11).\n    -   **BL (6):** Shoots NE from (18,1). It hits the Bottom-Left Vertical Line (6) at (11,8). The diagonal fills cells (17,2) through (12,7).\n    -   **BR (7):** Shoots NW from (18,17). It hits the Bottom-Right Vertical Line (7) at (11,10). The diagonal fills cells (17,16) through (12,11).\n\n2.  **Line Diagonals (Outwards):**\n    The vertical lines are struck at their \"inner\" ends (y=8 for top, y=11 for bottom). They emit new diagonals from their \"outer\" ends (y=6 for top, y=13 for bottom) in a direction diverging from the center, effectively reflecting the flow back towards the corners/edges.\n    -   **Top-Left Line (7):** From top end (6,8), emits NW (North-West). Path: (5,7), (4,6), (3,5), (2,4), (1,3), (0,2).\n    -   **Top-Right Line (6):** From top end (6,10), emits NE (North-East). Path: (5,11), (4,12), (3,13), (2,14), (1,15), (0,16).\n    -   **Bottom-Left Line (6):** From bottom end (13,8), emits SW (South-West). Path: (14,7), (15,6), (16,5), (17,4), (18,3), (19,2).\n    -   **Bottom-Right Line (7):** From bottom end (13,10), emits SE (South-East). Path: (14,11), (15,12), (16,13), (17,14), (18,15), (19,16).\n\nThis creates a symmetric pattern where the L-shapes connect to the lines, and the lines extend rays back out to the grid edges.\n\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,7\n0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **Background:** Color 0 field.\n2.  **L-Shaped Polyominoes:** 3-pixel clusters in a 2x2 footprint; various orientations; colors include 3, 4, 6, 7.\n3.  **Orthogonal Lines:** Contiguous horizontal or vertical segments (typically length 3); colors include 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n4.  **Diagonal Lines:** Chains of diagonally adjacent single pixels extending across the grid; colors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n<transformation_summary>\n- Keep all original non-0 pixels (objects) fixed; only add new pixels on 0 background.\n- Add 45\u00b0 diagonal lines (steps of \u00b11 row, \u00b11 col) using the emitting object\u2019s color (1/2/3/4/5/6/7).\n- For each 3-pixel L-shape, start from its elbow and extend in the diagonal direction opposite its missing 2\u00d72 corner; for each length-3 orthogonal segment, start from an endpoint and extend in a chosen diagonal direction.\n- Diagonals grow until the next step would leave the grid or hit a non-0 cell; they stop before collisions (no overwriting).\n- Junctions between diagonals/objects are formed by ending diagonals diagonally-adjacent; the junction cell may be owned by the \u201cnext\u201d color, causing the previous diagonal to stop 1 cell earlier.\n- Special case (example 1): for each single pixel of color c, create a junction 1 cell above it; connect the matching L-shape to that junction by a diagonal, then emit a second diagonal of color c from the junction to the grid boundary.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **Background:** Color 0 field.\n2.  **L-Shaped Polyominoes:** 3-pixel clusters in a 2x2 footprint; various orientations; colors include 3, 4, 6, 7.\n3.  **Orthogonal Lines:** Contiguous horizontal or vertical segments (typically length 3); colors include 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n4.  **Diagonal Lines:** Chains of diagonally adjacent single pixels extending across the grid; colors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n<transformation_summary>\n- Keep all original non-0 pixels (objects) fixed; only add new pixels on 0 background.\n- Add 45\u00b0 diagonal lines (steps of \u00b11 row, \u00b11 col) using the emitting object\u2019s color (1/2/3/4/5/6/7).\n- For each 3-pixel L-shape, start from its elbow and extend in the diagonal direction opposite its missing 2\u00d72 corner; for each length-3 orthogonal segment, start from an endpoint and extend in a chosen diagonal direction.\n- Diagonals grow until the next step would leave the grid or hit a non-0 cell; they stop before collisions (no overwriting).\n- Junctions between diagonals/objects are formed by ending diagonals diagonally-adjacent; the junction cell may be owned by the \u201cnext\u201d color, causing the previous diagonal to stop 1 cell earlier.\n- Special case (example 1): for each single pixel of color c, create a junction 1 cell above it; connect the matching L-shape to that junction by a diagonal, then emit a second diagonal of color c from the junction to the grid boundary.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred rule (from the solved examples)\n\nThe non\u2011zero shapes act like \u201cemitters\u201d and \u201cmirrors\u201d for 45\u00b0 diagonal rays; we **never move or erase** existing pixels, we only **add** new ones on 0-cells.\n\n1. **L-shape (3 pixels in a 2\u00d72 block)**  \n   - Find its **elbow** (the pixel with two orthogonal neighbors).\n   - Determine the **missing corner** of the 2\u00d72.\n   - From the elbow, the L-shape **emits a diagonal ray** in the direction **opposite** the missing corner (NW/NE/SW/SE).\n   - The ray fills empty cells until it is about to reach the next \u201cmirror junction\u201d (see below).\n\n2. **Length\u20113 straight segment (horizontal or vertical) = mirror**  \n   When a ray is going to hit an **endpoint** of a straight segment, we form a **junction** at the cell **just before** the hit (on the ray\u2019s diagonal path).  \n   That junction cell is colored with the **segment\u2019s color**, so the incoming ray stops **one cell earlier** (as in the examples\u2019 color handoffs).\n\n   Then the segment emits its own diagonal:\n   - It emits from the **opposite endpoint** (the far end of the length\u20113 segment).\n   - The direction is the **reflection** of the incoming diagonal:\n     - **Vertical segment:** flip left/right (NE\u2194NW, SE\u2194SW).\n     - **Horizontal segment:** flip up/down (NE\u2194SE, NW\u2194SW).\n   - It continues until the next step would leave the grid or hit a non\u2011zero cell.\n\n### Applying to the test grid\n\nThere are four corner **L-shapes** (two 7s, two 6s) and four central **vertical length\u20113 segments**.  \nEach corner L-shape\u2019s emitted diagonal reaches the nearest same\u2011colored vertical segment endpoint; that segment reflects the ray horizontally (because it\u2019s vertical) and emits the outgoing diagonal to the boundary. No paths collide, so all diagonals extend fully to the edge.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **Background:** Color 0 field.\n2.  **L-Shaped Polyominoes:** 3-pixel clusters in a 2x2 footprint; various orientations; colors include 3, 4, 6, 7.\n3.  **Orthogonal Lines:** Contiguous horizontal or vertical segments (typically length 3); colors include 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n4.  **Diagonal Lines:** Chains of diagonally adjacent single pixels extending across the grid; colors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n<transformation_summary>\n- Keep all original non-0 pixels (objects) fixed; only add new pixels on 0 background.\n- Add 45\u00b0 diagonal lines (steps of \u00b11 row, \u00b11 col) using the emitting object\u2019s color (1/2/3/4/5/6/7).\n- For each 3-pixel L-shape, start from its elbow and extend in the diagonal direction opposite its missing 2\u00d72 corner; for each length-3 orthogonal segment, start from an endpoint and extend in a chosen diagonal direction.\n- Diagonals grow until the next step would leave the grid or hit a non-0 cell; they stop before collisions (no overwriting).\n- Junctions between diagonals/objects are formed by ending diagonals diagonally-adjacent; the junction cell may be owned by the \u201cnext\u201d color, causing the previous diagonal to stop 1 cell earlier.\n- Special case (example 1): for each single pixel of color c, create a junction 1 cell above it; connect the matching L-shape to that junction by a diagonal, then emit a second diagonal of color c from the junction to the grid boundary.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

                "response": "**Analysis and Description of Grid Objects**\n\nOkay, here's my understanding. My task is to describe the *types* of objects I see in these grids, focusing on their *attributes* in a general way. No rules, just what's visible. And, I'm only using numeric values to represent colors.  I've got a mental sandbox here to analyze these.\n\nFirst, I looked at each grid one by one, making mental notes of the pixel patterns. I started with Grid 1, seeing these diagonal lines of different colored numbers.  I thought, are these just lines? What's going on with these patterns? I realized there were L-shapes in several grids. Then I looked for consistent patterns across all of the grids, to see if I could find distinct object *categories*.\n\nI noticed a recurring \"corner\" or \"L\" shape - three pixels in a 2x2 area. Sometimes they are in the corners, other times they're in the middle of the grid.  I saw these L-shapes were consistent in colors, like 4, 7, 3, and 6.\n\nThen, there were straight lines.  Vertical, horizontal, and diagonal. The diagonals were sometimes a little jagged, kind of like a series of single pixels stepping across the grid, but they were still straight lines in my mind. The straight lines were the main objects in the grids.\n\nThe only other thing present was the background, which is always color 0.\n\nSo, here's the summary:\n\n*   **Background:** Color 0, which is always present as the grid background.\n*   **Small Angular/L-Shapes:** Three pixels, 2x2 footprint, a uniform color. These look like an L shape.\n*   **Lines/Segments:** These are straight and all the same color.  They can be Horizontal, Vertical, or Diagonal.\n\nThese categories seem to cover everything I'm seeing! No complex relationships, just the basic object types.\n\n\nThe grids contain several distinct types of geometric objects distinguished by their shape, orientation, and color. All objects appear against a background of color 0.\n\n**1. Small Corner / L-Shaped Polyominoes**\n*   **Description:** These are small, compact shapes comprised of exactly three pixels of a single color arranged within a 2x2 area.

Objects Description\n1.  **Background:** Color 0 field.\n2.  **L-Shaped Polyominoes:** 3-pixel clusters in a 2x2 footprint; various orientations; colors include 3, 4, 6, 7.\n3.  **Orthogonal Lines:** Contiguous horizontal or vertical segments (typically length 3); colors include 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n4.  **Diagonal Lines:** Chains of diagonally adjacent single pixels extending across the grid; colors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.",
                "response": "### Global / always-present changes (all examples)\n\n1. **Background preserved**\n- Color **0** stays **0** everywhere unless a new pixel is explicitly drawn on top of it.\n\n2. **Input objects are preserved in-place**\n- All non\u20110 pixels that belong to the original objects (L\u2011shapes, horizontal/vertical segments, and single pixels) remain in the **same coordinates** in the output.\n- No rotations/translations/scaling of the original objects were observed.\n\n3. **Only additive drawing is performed**\n- The output is the input **plus** new pixels (no deletions of existing colored pixels).\n\n---\n\n### Main added structure: diagonal \u201crays/links\u201d (45\u00b0)\n\n4. **New pixels are added as 45\u00b0 diagonal chains**\n- The output introduces **diagonal lines** made of diagonally-adjacent pixels (steps of **(\u00b11, \u00b11)**).\n- The added diagonal pixels normally use the **same color** as the object that \u201cemits\u201d the diagonal (examples show colors **1,2,3,4,5,6,7** doing this).\n\n5. **Likely start/anchor points for diagonals**\n- **L\u2011shaped 3\u2011pixel objects (in a 2\u00d72 box)**: the diagonal typically starts from the **elbow** pixel (the pixel orthogonally adjacent to the other two).\n- **Orthogonal length\u20113 segments**: the diagonal typically starts from a **segment endpoint** (one of its two ends).\n- **Single pixels** (example 1): they function as **markers/targets** that determine where a diagonal should end or where a \u201cturn/junction\u201d is placed (see below).\n\n---\n\n### Direction choice for the diagonal\n\n6. **L\u2011shape direction depends on its missing corner**\n- For an L\u2011shape occupying 3 cells of a 2\u00d72 box, the diagonal direction is consistent with:\n  - Find the **missing** corner of that 2\u00d72 box.\n  - From the elbow, extend the diagonal in the **opposite diagonal direction** (the diagonal pointing away from the missing corner).\n- Observed results:\n  - Missing **0** in the L\u2019s 2\u00d72 footprint \u2192 diagonal goes into the opposite diagonal quadrant.\n  - This explains why some L\u2011shapes generate **SE** diagonals and others generate **NW/SE** in different examples.\n\n7. **Line-segment diagonals use one endpoint + one diagonal direction**\n- Vertical and horizontal segments generate a diagonal from **one end** of the segment.\n- The chosen diagonal direction varies across examples (NE/NW/SE/SW all appear) and is consistent with \u201caiming\u201d toward another structure or toward the boundary until stopped (see stopping rules below).\n\n---\n\n### Stopping / interaction rules for diagonals\n\n8. **Diagonals extend until blocked**\nA diagonal line continues step-by-step until one of these conditions occurs:\n\n- **Boundary stop:** the next step would leave the grid \u2192 stop at the last in\u2011bounds cell.\n- **Collision stop:** the next step would enter a cell that is already non\u20110 (either an original object pixel or an already-drawn diagonal pixel) \u2192 stop **before** that cell.\n  - This prevents overwriting: existing colored pixels remain unchanged.\n\n9. **Diagonals can \u201cconnect\u201d by ending diagonally adjacent**\n- Because diagonals stop right before a non\u20110 obstacle, their endpoints often end up **diagonally adjacent** to the obstacle pixel.\n- This creates visible \u201clinks\u201d between different colors/objects without overlap.\n\n10. **Possible \u201chandoff / junction ownership\u201d behavior (observed strongly in examples 2\u20133)**\n- In multiple places, the would-be continuation cell on a diagonal that *could have been* part of color **A** is instead colored as the next object/segment\u2019s color **B**.\n- Interpretable as:\n  - When two diagonals meet (or a diagonal approaches another object), the **junction cell** is \u201cowned\u201d (colored) by the **target/next** object\u2019s color, and the incoming diagonal stops one step earlier.\n- This yields multi-color zigzag chains like **4 \u2192 1 \u2192 7 \u2192 5 \u2192 2** (example 3) and similar chains in example 2.\n\n---\n\n### Special/junction rule seen in Example 1 (marker-based vertex + second diagonal)\n\n11. **Marker-based junction above a single pixel**\n- Example 1 contains single pixels (colors **5,2,1,3**) aligned on a common column.\n- For each color **c**:\n  - A **junction/vertex** is created at the cell **one row above** the single pixel of color **c** (same column).\n  - A diagonal from the corresponding L\u2011shape of color **c** reaches that junction (via the L\u2011shape\u2019s diagonal direction rule).\n\n12. **Second diagonal emitted from the junction**\n- From that junction cell, a **second diagonal** of the **same color** is drawn in a different diagonal direction (in the examples: toward the top/right boundary), again stopping at the grid edge.\n\nThis produces a 2\u2011segment \u201cangle\u201d (two diagonals meeting at the junction) for each of those colors.\n\n---\n\n## <transformation_summary>\n<transformation_summary>\n- Keep all original non-0 pixels (objects) fixed; only add new pixels on 0 background.\n- Add 45\u00b0 diagonal lines (steps of \u00b11 row, \u00b11 col) using the emitting object\u2019s color (1/2/3/4/5/6/7).\n- For each 3-pixel L-shape, start from its elbow and extend in the diagonal direction opposite its missing 2\u00d72 corner; for each length-3 orthogonal segment, start from an endpoint and extend in a chosen diagonal direction.\n- Diagonals grow until the next step would leave the grid or hit a non-0 cell; they stop before collisions (no overwriting).\n- Junctions between diagonals/objects are formed by ending diagonals diagonally-adjacent; the junction cell may be owned by the \u201cnext\u201d color, causing the previous diagonal to stop 1 cell earlier.\n- Special case (example 1): for each single pixel of color c, create a junction 1 cell above it; connect the matching L-shape to that junction by a diagonal, then emit a second diagonal of color c from the junction to the grid boundary.\n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **Background:** Color 0 field.\n2.  **L-Shaped Polyominoes:** 3-pixel clusters in a 2x2 footprint; various orientations; colors include 3, 4, 6, 7.\n3.  **Orthogonal Lines:** Contiguous horizontal or vertical segments (typically length 3); colors include 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n4.  **Diagonal Lines:** Chains of diagonally adjacent single pixels extending across the grid; colors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n<transformation_summary>\n- Keep all original non-0 pixels (objects) fixed; only add new pixels on 0 background.\n- Add 45\u00b0 diagonal lines (steps of \u00b11 row, \u00b11 col) using the emitting object\u2019s color (1/2/3/4/5/6/7).\n- For each 3-pixel L-shape, start from its elbow and extend in the diagonal direction opposite its missing 2\u00d72 corner; for each length-3 orthogonal segment, start from an endpoint and extend in a chosen diagonal direction.\n- Diagonals grow until the next step would leave the grid or hit a non-0 cell; they stop before collisions (no overwriting).\n- Junctions between diagonals/objects are formed by ending diagonals diagonally-adjacent; the junction cell may be owned by the \u201cnext\u201d color, causing the previous diagonal to stop 1 cell earlier.\n- Special case (example 1): for each single pixel of color c, create a junction 1 cell above it; connect the matching L-shape to that junction by a diagonal, then emit a second diagonal of color c from the junction to the grid boundary.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
