        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Strategy: A Detailed Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given two examples and a test input to work with. The goal is to figure out the rule that transforms the input grids into the output grids.\n\nInitially, I'm noticing that the input grids have a distinct structure: alternating rows. Even rows are mostly filled with 8s, with occasional 3s and 0s, and odd rows are mostly 0s, with some 7s. The outputs seem related but change in color and pattern.\n\nMy thought process is to look more closely at this pattern. The rows seem to be paired or related. Even rows act like texture rows (8s) and odd rows act like marker rows (0s with 7s).\n\nI start to analyze Example 1. The input grid has 13 rows and 19 columns, and so does the output grid. The '7s' in odd rows (marker rows) always appear in the form of `7,7,7` and it has a corresponding 3s, 8s, and 0s in other rows.\n\nObservation: \"Markers\" (`7,7,7`) become patterns in the output. For example, `7,7,7` in the input maps to `8,6,8` in the output. The locations of these markers also affect the rows above and below. Wherever there's a `7,7,7` in an odd row $i$, rows $i-1$ and $i+1$ also have the central region of the cells affected. It's a 3x3 pattern with a 6 in the middle (odd) and surrounding 8s. It's clear that wherever there's `7,7,7` in an odd row, you end up with an `8,6,8` block in those three rows.\n\nI then look more closely at the rows where 3s and 0s are in even rows. I see that the `3` values at the start and end rows seem to propagate. They may \"fall\" through the grid from the original positions. It looks like the presence of a '0' in a specific location seems to cause a '3' to appear next to it on the grid.\n\nAnalyzing the 3s is crucial. The input '3's are at the beginning and the end of each line (except the last). In the output, they seem to move diagonally or they \"spawn\".\n\nI started to check if the behavior of the `3`s is determined by `7,7,7` markers. Do the `7,7,7` markers create regions or are they just deflectors? Or, are they are just a feature \"overwriting\" everything?\n\nI tried the \"shadow\" or \"gravity\" analogy to see if the markers attract or create shadows which might affect the location of '3's.\nThe output seems to have two parts: one determined by `7,7,7`, and one, the propagation of 3s and 0s.\n\nSo, it seems there's a 3x3 pattern formed from the '7,7,7'. The '3's from input is just a background object. The '7,7,7's essentially creates \"vertical bars\" with 6 in the middle of odd rows. The background remains mostly 8. The 3s are a little more complex. The \"3\"s in the input move diagonally. The 0s spawn 3s. There is also, possibly, a \"cellular automaton\" or some propagating behavior.\n\nIt seems to me, there is some kind of \"movement\". From the pattern, it seems a 3,3 (sometimes) will appear, and propagate. If there is no space to move, they may vanish or overwrite (with a 6, probably). It's possible that the \"movement\" or appearance of 3s are determined by markers above or below.\n\nI formulated hypothesis:\n\n*   **Step 1:** Wherever `7,7,7` shows up, it's expanded by the stamp (8, 6, 8) and it is going to overwrite anything there. All the other 0s are going to be overwritten.\n*   **Step 2:** All the \"0\"s will create an additional \"3\" and propagate (right or left).\n*   **Step 3:** The wall 3s are more complicated. If there is no marker above, they do not show up. It also seems that these wall 3s \"move\" together, if they find space. The 3s are not always stable.\n\nSo, I need to check the exact conditions where this happens. Is there an \"attraction\" between 3s and markers?\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows a set of rules driven by the \"marker\" patterns (sequences of `7, 7, 7`) in the odd-numbered rows and the presence of `3`s and `0`s in the even-numbered rows.\n\n**Rules derived:**\n\n1.  **Grid Initialization**:\n    -   The output grid generally preserves the background colors of the input rows (teal `8` for even rows, black `0` for odd rows), except where transformations occur.\n\n2.  **Marker Expansion (The `7, 7, 7` to `8, 6, 8` structure)**:\n    -   Identify every sequence of `7, 7, 7` in the input's odd rows. Let the center of such a sequence be at `(row, col)`.\n    -   In the output grid, this marker creates a 3x3 structure centered at `(row, col)`.\n    -   The cells `(r, c)` for `r` in `{row-1, row, row+1}` become `6` (magenta).\n    -   The cells `(r, c-1)` and `(r, c+1)` for `r` in `{row-1, row, row+1}` become `8` (teal).\n    -   This structure overwrites any underlying values.\n\n3.  **Black Dots (`0`) in Even Rows**:\n    -   If an even row contains a `0` (black) and that row has \"support\" from markers in the row directly above (i.e., the odd row above it has at least one marker):\n        -   The `0` remains `0`.\n        -   It spawns a green `3` in the adjacent cell towards the horizontal center of the grid (i.e., to the right if in the left half, to the left if in the right half).\n    -   If there is no marker in the row above (e.g., Row 0 or below an empty odd row), the `0` remains but does not spawn a `3`.\n\n4.  **Wall `3`s (Green) in Even Rows**:\n    -   The input typically has `3`s at the start (col 0) and end (col Width-1) of even rows.\n    -   In the output, these `3`s persist or grow based on the proximity of markers in the row *above* ($r-1$).\n    -   **No Marker Above**: If row $r-1$ has no markers (or $r=0$), the wall `3`s disappear (become background `8`).\n    -   **Marker Above**:\n        -   Calculate the \"gap\" between the wall and the nearest marker pattern in row $r-1$.\n        -   **Small Gap** (<= 3 cells): The `3`s expand to fill the corner, typically forming `3, 3`.\n        -   **Large Gap** (> 3 cells): The single `3` at the wall persists.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Row 0**: No row above. Input `3`s disappear. `8`s remaining are affected by Row 1 marker.\n    *   Marker R1 at col 10 (range 9-11).\n    *   Output: `8`s, with `8,6,8` at cols 9-11.\n\n*   **Row 1**: Odd row, background `0`.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**The Enigma of the Grid: My Journey Through the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an intriguing challenge \u2013 an ARC task where I have to crack the code behind transforming grid inputs into specific outputs, based on just a couple of examples and a test input. I need to figure out what's going on and then apply it.\n\n**Phase 1: Decoding the 7s and Their Transformation**\n\nImmediately, I zero in on what seems to be the core element of this transformation: the '7's. These '7's show up in the input grids, and then, *poof*, they change in the output. I realized that the \u20187,7,7\u2019 pattern is a key indicator. It looks like each '7,7,7' block triggers a 3x3 modification around its center. The magic? The central column within that block changes to a '6', while the columns immediately to its left and right change to '8's. That sets the stage.\n\n**Phase 2: The Mystery of the Shifting 3s**\n\nThen, I focused on the \"3s\". This is where things became a lot more interesting (and complicated). Even rows in the input have '3's at the ends. They didn't simply stay. They disappear, move, and even duplicate themselves in the outputs. The key here appeared to be the relationship between the 3s and the 7-induced \u20188,6,8\u2019 patterns.\n\nI realized the 3s' behavior seemed to follow a very specific rule related to the 7s in the above and below rows. So I started investigating if the presence of '7,7,7' blocks was affecting the presence and location of the '3's in the rows below.\n\nIt looked as though the rule was if a row contains a `7,7,7` block and it's center index is located near a `3` in the adjacent row below, the 3 is destroyed.\n\nThe tricky part was that it was an alternating pattern. For example, in the test input's row 0, the first 3 disappears, but not in all cases. This is where I needed to come up with a rule to dictate if a '3' should exist or not.\n\n**Phase 3: Building a Predictable Framework**\n\nAfter investigating the logic, I made the call to move forward with the following principles to build a plan for the transformations:\n1.  **Transform the 7s**: First, identify the \u20187,7,7\u2019 patterns, replace them with an \u20188,6,8\u2019 transformation.\n2.  **Handle the 3s**: If a 3 is located in the row, then:\n    - If the 3 is adjacent to a 7 Block center (dist <= 5): Delete the 3\n    - If it's a \"safe\" 3, that 3 becomes a 3,3.\n\n**Phase 4: The Construction**\n\nWith these rules in hand, I\u2019m ready to construct the solution for each row:\n1.  Initialize the output with the base from the original input grid.\n2.  Clear any existing `3` at the first row.\n3.  Perform the 8,6,8 transform pattern.\n4.  Update the 3s from the pattern above.\n5.  Generate the final output.\n\nI think I\u2019ve got this. Let\u2019s see if this logic pays off!\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of integers based on patterns inferred from solved examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The grid consists of alternating rows. Even-numbered rows (0, 2, 4...) are \"bars\" predominantly filled with color 8 (teal), with optional 3s (green) at the ends. Odd-numbered rows (1, 3, 5...) are predominantly 0 (black) and contain markers consisting of three consecutive 7s (orange), e.g., `7, 7, 7`.\n\n2.  **Transformation of 7s**:\n    A block of `7, 7, 7` at columns `c-1, c, c+1` in row `r` generates a vertical structure in the output.\n    -   The 3x3 area centered at `(r, c)` (covering rows `r-1, r, r+1` and columns `c-1, c, c+1`) is transformed.\n    -   The center column `c` becomes 6 (magenta) in these three rows.\n    -   The side columns `c-1` and `c+1` become 8 (teal) in these three rows.\n    -   Effectively, `7,7,7` creates a \"pillar\" pattern of `8, 6, 8` extending one row up and one row down, overwriting whatever was there.\n\n3.  **Transformation of 3s**:\n    The 3s (green) at the ends of the even rows behave like items that can be preserved, duplicated, or destroyed based on the `7,7,7` markers in the row *below*.\n    -   **Top Row (Row 0)**: Any 3s are removed.\n    -   **Internal Even Rows**:\n        -   If there is a `7,7,7` block in the odd row immediately *below* whose center is \"close\" to the 3 (distance $\\le$ 5 columns), the 3 is **removed** (overwritten by 8).\n        -   If there are no such blocks, or the blocks are \"far\" (distance $> 5$ columns), the 3 is **duplicated** (occupying the two outermost columns, e.g., `3, 3` at the start or end).\n    -   **Bottom Row**: Generally inherits or generates 3s, but in the test case, the conditions (blocking from row above) suggest no 3s will appear if blocked.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe grid is 19 rows by 17 columns.\n-   **Row 1** has `7,7,7` at indices 9-11 (Center 10).\n-   **Row 3** has `7,7,7` at indices 12-14 (Center 13).\n-   **Row 5** is empty.\n-   **Row 7** has `7,7,7` at indices 6-8 (Center 7).\n-   **Row 9** has `7,7,7` at indices 3-5 (Center 4).\n-   **Row 11** is empty.\n-   **Row 13** has `7,7,7` at indices 9-11 (Center 10).\n-   **Row 15** has `7,7,7` at indices 6-8 (Center 7).\n-   **Row 17** has `7,7,7` at indices 2-4 (Center 3) and 11-13 (Center 12).\n\n**Logic Row by Row:**\n-   **Row 0**: 3s removed. `8,6,8` at cols 9-11 (from R1).\n-   **Row 2**: 3s at ends. Below (R3) block at 13.\n    -   Left (0): Dist 13 (Safe) -> `3,3`.\n    -   Right (16): Dist 3 (Unsafe) -> Remove.\n    -   `8,6,8` at 9-11 (from R1) and 12-14 (from R3).\n-   **Row 4**: 3s at ends. Below (R5) empty. Safe. `3,3` at both ends. `8,6,8` at 12-14 (from R3).\n-   **Row 6**: 3s at ends. Below (R7) block at 7. Left Dist 7 (Safe), Right Dist 9 (Safe). `3,3` at both ends. `8,6,8` at 6-8 (from R7).\n-   **Row 8**: 3s at ends. Below (R9) block at 4. Left Dist 4 (Unsafe) -> Remove. Right Dist 12 (Safe) -> `3,3`. `8,6,8` at 6-8 (from R7) and 3-5 (from R9).\n-   **Row 10**: 3s at ends. Below (R11) empty. Safe. `3,3` at both ends. `8,6,8` at 3-5 (from R9).\n-   **Row 12**: 3s at ends. Below (R13) block at 10. Left Dist 10 (Safe), Right Dist 6 (Safe). `3,3` at both ends. `8,6,8` at 9-11 (from R13).\n-   **Row 14**: 3s at ends. Below (R15) block at 7. Left Dist 7 (Safe), Right Dist 9 (Safe). `3,3` at both ends. `8,6,8` at 9-11 (from R13) and 6-8 (from R15).\n-   **Row 16**: 3s at ends. Below (R17) blocks at 3, 12. Left Dist 3 (Unsafe), Right Dist 4 (Unsafe). Both removed. `8,6,8` at 6-8 (from R15) and 2-4, 11-13 (from R17).\n-   **Row 18**: No 3s. `8,6,8` at 2-4 and 11-13 (from R17).\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3\n0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8\n0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0\n8,8,8,6,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8",

The output removes all 7s and introduces 6s as \u201ccenters\u201d of those 7-blocks.\n\n#### 1) Convert each `7,7,7` block into `8,6,8`\nIn any row, whenever three consecutive 7s occur horizontally:\n\n- replace them with `8,6,8` (middle becomes 6, the two ends become 8).\n\n#### 2) Extend the center upward and downward by one cell\nFor the same `7,7,7` block with center column `c`:\n\n- in the row directly above, set column `c` to 6 (if it is not 0),\n- in the row directly below, set column `c` to 6 (if it is not 0).\n\nSo each 7-triplet creates a vertical 3-cell \u201cpillar\u201d of 6s (above / center / below).\n\n#### 3) Border-3 handling on 8-rows\nFor rows that have border 3s in the input:\n\n- the **top row** loses its border 3s (they become 8),\n- other such rows normally also lose border 3s **unless** they contain an internal 0 \u201chole\u201d, in which case the border 3s are kept.\n- additionally, if the 0-row immediately above has a `7,7,7` block very near an edge, the border is emphasized by making it **double** (`3,3` on that side):\n  - if a triplet starts at column \u2264 3 \u21d2 set columns 0 and 1 to 3\n  - if a triplet ends at column \u2265 (W\u22124) \u21d2 set columns W\u22122 and W\u22121 to 3\n\n#### 4) Mark holes (0s) inside 8-rows below a 0-row\nIn an 8-row that is directly below a 0-row, each internal 0-hole marks an adjacent cell (toward the horizontal center) as 3.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0  \n3,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,3,3  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n3,3,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,3  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8  \n0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,6,8,0,0,0  \n3,3,8,6,8,8,8,0,3,8,8,8,6,8,8,3,3",
