        "Full raw LLM response": "**Comprehensive Analysis and Solution for the ARC Task**\n\nMy objective is to solve an ARC task, guided by four examples and a test input. The task involves transforming input grids based on identified patterns, specifically involving color-coded regions and \u201cmarkers\u201d within them. The goal is to produce an output grid with a corresponding structure.\n\n**Initial Exploration: Recognizing Grid Structure and Transformations**\n\n*   **Example 1 Analysis:** The input grid (16x12) is transformed into a transposed output (12x16). The key insight here is identifying rectangular, color-coded regions and the presence of \"noise\" pixels that act as markers. I analyze dimensions, the number of input rows that correspond to columns, and how the \u201cnoise\u201d pixels can relate to color transformations. I try to establish a consistent mapping for the color-code runs (for example 6 (10), 7 (3), 8 (3)) and how these input runs map to output. It seems that output rows correspond to input columns, and their content is changed.\n*   **Example 2 & Transposition:** Example 2 (10x10) lacks transposition, and the Output Row i corresponds to Input Row i. There's a rule-based relationship between dimensions, and transposition (or not) is a function of H != W or H == W, though it is ultimately determined by whether the rows or columns will remain similar in the output. This is a crucial observation for solving the task. If H!=W, we must transpose, and if H==W, we can leave the original mapping.\n*   **Region and Marker Identification:** Regions of uniform color (background colors) are identified, and the structure of \"markers\" is revealed. These markers, comprised of a \"center\" pixel with surrounding \"petals,\" are key to the transformation. The question is: What do these \u201cmarkers\u201d mean, and how do they map to the outputs? The objective is to determine a systematic way to map each region\u2019s background color and marker to an output color.\n\n**Mapping Logic: Connecting Markers and Output Colors**\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: Direct Marker-to-Output Mapping:** I begin with the hypothesis that the marker color directly translates to the output color. This doesn't apply based on examples.\n*   **Hypothesis 2: Mapping by Counting or Petals:** This involves counting marker petals to determine the output. Not helpful.\n*   **Hypothesis 3: Background + Marker Relationship:** I explore relationships like `Output = F(Background, Marker)`. This isn't straightforward because the \u201cnoise\u201d might need more context.\n*   **Hypothesis 4: Arrow Shape and Pointer:** The markers might point to neighboring regions, with output taking the neighbor\u2019s color. This works for simple cases, and the \"missing arm\" indicates arrow direction or a specific transformation.\n*   **Hypothesis 5: \"Noise\" Indicates New Colors** I try using the \"noise\" color to map. Then I try using all the noise to create a unique transformation to an output.\n*   **Hypothesis 6: Region Color Mapping** A direct map for input region -> output. This requires additional insight to find consistent mapping across examples.\n*   **Hypothesis 7: Missing-Arm Direction & Pointer Target:** My attention shifts to the \"Missing arm\" on the \"Marker\" or the direction that the marker points to. The pointed region is mapped to output, but it doesn\u2019t always hold across all examples. The neighbor is then used, but still no success.\n\n**Refining the Logic: Identifying Consistent Rules**\n\nThe logic evolves to:\n*   The output color is from the neighbour\u2019s output.\n*   There's also some additional map.\nI analyze each region\u2019s neighbors (which can be a different input color).\nI try and see if there is a color-change that has some consistent mapping.\nI decide to use the \u201cpointer\u201d hypothesis from before and see if it can point to a neighboring region and try to map.\n\nI determine that a consistent pointer for the examples is:\nFor a marker missing-arm, the direction indicates the *color* that the source output should map to. Then I try and use a source-output to determine what the target should map to.\n\nIn the test input, my analysis continues.\nI identify multiple regions (e.g., Background 9, 0, 2, 6, etc.), markers within these, and the specific positions of marker elements (center, petals, \"missing arm\"). I trace boundaries and connections between the markers and their neighboring pixels, so I can establish how regions work.\nI try to follow the \"pointer\" to a target value.\nI try to create a mapping: Map a region to an output.\nAt this point, I think I have a stable rule\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Inferred Logic:**\n1.  **Region Identification:** The grid is composed of rectangular regions of uniform background color, some containing \"markers\" (small patterns of noise pixels).\n2.  **Marker Decoding:** Markers act as directional pointers. They typically appear as a \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape with one arm missing or a specific alignment. The \"missing arm\" or the orientation indicates a direction (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).\n3.  **Transformation Rule:** The background color of a region changes to the background color of the **neighboring region** pointed to by the marker.\n    *   If a region has no marker, it generally adopts the color of the region above it (or defaults to the dominant/background color if at the top).\n4.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Region 3 (Background 3):** Located at the top-left (rows 2-6). Contains a marker centered at (3,14) with color 1. The marker shape suggests pointing **Top**. The neighbor above is Region 9. **Mapping: 3 -> 9.**\n    *   **Region 0 Top (Background 0):** Located at mid-left (rows 7-13). Contains a marker centered at (8,6) with color 8. The marker shape suggests pointing **Top**. The neighbor above is Region 3. **Mapping: 0 -> 3** (takes the original color of Region 3).\n    *   **Region 2 (Background 2):** Located at mid-left (rows 9-15). Contains a marker centered at (10,14) with color 1. The marker shape suggests pointing **Top**. The neighbor above is Region 0. **Mapping: 2 -> 0** (takes the original color of Region 0).\n    *   **Region 0 Bottom (Background 0):** Located inside Region 6 (rows 14-19). Contains a marker centered at (17,7) with color 1. The marker shape suggests pointing **Bottom**. The neighbor below is Region 6. **Mapping: 0 -> 6.**\n    *   **Region 6 (Background 6):** Located at bottom-left (rows 14+). Contains a marker centered at (20,12) with color 1. The marker shape suggests pointing **Bottom**. The neighbor below is Region 9. **Mapping: 6 -> 9.**\n    *   **Region 9 (Background 9):** Dominant background. No marker. Maps to itself. **Mapping: 9 -> 9.**\n    *   **Other Regions (7, 4, 8):** Do not contain markers. Following the \"copy neighbor/default\" logic and the flow of the dominant color 9, they all map to 9.\n\n**Final Color Mapping:**\n*   Input 0 (Top, rows < 14) -> Output 3\n*   Input 0 (Bottom, rows >= 14) -> Output 6\n*   Input 2 -> Output 0\n*   All other colors (9, 3, 6, 7, 4, 8, 1) -> Output 9\n\nThe output grid is generated by applying this mapping to the input grid.\n\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Expert Analysis and Strategy for Solving This ARC Problem**\n\nI'm tackling an ARC problem here, where the goal is to transform an input grid into a specific output grid based on a few examples. My initial instinct, based on experience, is that it's a *transposition* of dimensions, but the color mapping is the tricky part. It's not a simple 1:1 color swap. The problem is complex as the images have some visual noise pixels. I see this a similar \"map\" problem, with the input being a map containing shapes, colors, and hints.\n\nI've carefully analyzed several solved examples and quickly identified a pattern. The input grid acts like a blueprint for the output. There is a **90-degree clockwise rotation**, changing the input height and width. This is confirmed across multiple examples with varying grid sizes. The noise pixels are crucial.\n\nThe colors in the output are *not* a direct copy of the input colors. In fact, these noise regions, *define* the output regions' colors in a way. I can see that the input regions contain shapes of noise pixels (usually blue), and pixels of colors other than the background color. I'm hypothesizing that these noise pixels are *defining* boundaries or *seed* pixels for the output regions. The noise pixels define shapes, within the output grid, which define how to color a region!\n\nThere's a systematic approach: Rotate, identify shapes, look at seeds in those shapes and build new sections of output, from this information.\n\nSpecifically, I'm working with these key ideas:\n\n1.  **Rotation:** The output is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input.\n2.  **Boundary & Seed Extraction:** The \"noise\" pixels, particularly those colored blue, represent a boundary or edge of new shape. Also, the pixels inside these shapes. We can think of the pixels as the start of a flood fill.\n3.  **Region Coloring:** Using the seed pixel's color, use this color to generate a cross-shaped pattern in the output or a large rectangular section. It is likely a combination of these elements.\n4.  **Background Replacement:** The large regions in the input, not associated with a seed, are assigned the background color, but can be replaced by the background that is created in the rotation.\n\nI'm confident this logic will work. I'm going to test my logic on the test input.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples and the test input, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Geometric Transformation**: The output grid is the input grid rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n    *   Input dimensions $(H, W)$ become Output dimensions $(W, H)$.\n    *   A pixel at input $(r, c)$ moves to output $(c, H - 1 - r)$.\n\n2.  **Region Definition and Coloring**:\n    *   The input grid contains \"noise\" pixels, particularly `1`s (blue), which act as markers or boundaries for regions.\n    *   These markers define the logical regions of the output image.\n    *   For each region in the output, the color is determined by a \"Seed\" pixel found within the corresponding region of the input (often enclosed or adjacent to the marker `1`s).\n    *   If a region does not have an explicit seed pattern enclosed by `1`s, it takes the dominant color of that region from the rotated input, or follows the pattern of the solved examples where the grid is partitioned into large rectangular blocks.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   **Input Dimensions**: 30x30. **Output Dimensions**: 30x30.\n    *   **Rotation**: We map the regions of the Input to the Output via 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n        *   Input Bottom-Left $\\rightarrow$ Output Top-Left.\n        *   Input Top-Left $\\rightarrow$ Output Top-Right.\n        *   Input Bottom-Right $\\rightarrow$ Output Bottom-Left.\n        *   Input Top-Right $\\rightarrow$ Output Bottom-Right.\n    *   **Region Mapping**:\n        *   **Output Top-Left**: Corresponds to Input Bottom-Left (Rows 14-29, Cols 0-12). This area is dominated by color **6**.\n        *   **Output Top-Right**: Corresponds to Input Top-Left (Rows 0-13, Cols 0-12). This area is color 9, but contains a \"Seed\" structure of **8** (at Input 8,6). Following Example 1, seeds overwrite the background. So this region becomes **8**.\n        *   **Output Bottom-Left**: Corresponds to Input Bottom-Right (Rows 14-29, Cols 13-29). This area contains a large block of color **2** (Input Rows 14-25). Although there is an 8 at the bottom, the 2 is the dominant central feature filling this quadrant.\n        *   **Output Bottom-Right**: Corresponds to Input Top-Right (Rows 0-13, Cols 13-29). This area contains color **4** (Input Rows 7-25, Cols 23-29).\n    *   **Boundaries**:\n        *   The vertical boundary in the Input at Col 12 becomes a horizontal boundary in the Output at Row 12.\n        *   The horizontal transition in the Input around Row 13 becomes a vertical boundary in the Output around Col 16 (since $29-13 = 16$).\n\n    **Final Grid Layout**:\n    *   **Rows 0-12**:\n        *   **Cols 0-15**: Color **6**.\n        *   **Cols 16-29**: Color **8**.\n    *   **Rows 13-29**:\n        *   **Cols 0-15**: Color **2**.\n        *   **Cols 16-29**: Color **4**.\n\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the solved examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Cross pattern detection**: The input grids contain \"cross\" patterns made of 1s with a non-1 center value. These centers indicate color transformations.\n\n2. **Color replacement**: The center value of a cross indicates what color should replace the background color of that region in the output.\n\n3. **Dimension handling**: For non-square grids, dimensions are transposed. For square grids (like the test), dimensions stay the same.\n\n4. **1s removal**: All 1s (cross arms) are removed and filled with the surrounding/appropriate color.\n\n**Analysis of test input:**\n- Found cross at (8, 6) with center **8** - this is in the **0** region, so 0 \u2192 8\n- Found cross at (28, 12) with center **0** - this is in/near the **8** region, so 8 \u2192 0\n- Other regions (3, 2, 6, 4, 7, 9) remain unchanged\n- All 1s are removed and filled with appropriate surrounding colors\n\nThe transformation:\n- Replace all 0s with 8s\n- Replace all 8s with 0s  \n- Remove all 1s by filling with neighboring region color\n- Maintain 9 as separator/background\n- Keep 3, 2, 6, 4, 7 unchanged\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,9\n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4\n9,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4\n9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,0,0,0,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Transpose the grid.**  \n   In Examples 1 and 3 the output size is exactly the input size with rows/columns swapped, so the first step is a transpose. (For square grids like Examples 2 and 4 and this test, the transpose leaves the size unchanged.)\n\n2. **Treat color `1` as a \u201cconnector\u201d that induces a color swap between the two regions it connects.**  \n   Each connected group of `1`s forms a short \u201cwire\u201d. For each such wire, look along its main straight direction (horizontal or vertical): the first non-`1` color on one end and the first non-`1` color on the opposite end define a **swap**.  \n   Across the whole grid, these swaps compose into a single consistent recoloring of the large regions (as seen in the examples: the result is a clean block recoloring with all the `1`s disappearing into their surrounding regions).\n\n3. **Apply the resulting composed recoloring to every non-`1` cell.**  \n   In the test case, the connectors imply the composed color mapping:\n   - `9 \u2192 2`\n   - `3 \u2192 9`\n   - `7 \u2192 3`\n   - `0 \u2192 4`\n   - `2 \u2192 6`\n   - `6 \u2192 0`\n   - `4 \u2192 8`\n   - `8 \u2192 7`\n\n4. **Remove the connectors (`1`s) by filling them with their surrounding region color.**  \n   Each `1` is inside (or immediately adjacent to) a dominant region; in the output it takes that region\u2019s recolored value (so no `1` remains).\n\nApplying these steps to the test input gives the following output grid.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,2\n2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,2\n2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,2\n2,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8\n2,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8\n2,9,9,9,4,4,7,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8\n2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8\n2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8\n2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8\n2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8\n2,9,9,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,7,7,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,7,7,7,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7",

Instead, the task behaves like a **global recoloring**:\n\n1. **Derive a cyclic color mapping from the main diagonal** (top-left to bottom-right):\n   - Read the diagonal colors in order.\n   - Keep the **first occurrence** of each color (ignore repeats).\n   - This ordered list defines a **cycle**: each color maps to the *next* one in the list, and the last maps back to the first.\n\n2. **Recolor the whole grid using that cycle mapping**, leaving any colors not in the cycle unchanged.\n\nFor the test grid, the main diagonal\u2019s first-time-seen colors are:\n`[9, 3, 0, 2, 8]`\n\nSo the cycle mapping is:\n- `9 \u2192 3`\n- `3 \u2192 0`\n- `0 \u2192 2`\n- `2 \u2192 8`\n- `8 \u2192 9`\n\nAll other colors (`1,4,5,6,7`) remain unchanged.\n\nApplying this mapping to every cell gives the output below.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,7,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,7,7,7,7,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,1,1,1,3,3,4\n3,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4\n3,0,0,0,2,1,9,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n3,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,1,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4\n3,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n3,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n3,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n3,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,6,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,9,9,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,9,9,9,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9\n6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,1\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9",
