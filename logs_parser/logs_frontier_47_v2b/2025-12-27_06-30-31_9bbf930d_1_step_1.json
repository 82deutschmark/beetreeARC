        "Full raw LLM call": "You are an expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect. You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

        "Full raw LLM response": "**The Latch and the Box: Unraveling the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. It's all about how a \"6\" behaves in a grid, and I need to figure out the rules based on examples. The \"6\" seems like a key, a latch, or maybe a cursor. My goal is to determine the logic behind this \"6\" movement, which I suspect will be the foundation of solving this puzzle.\n\nI've examined the training data carefully, and here's what I've found:\n\nThe grid is composed of rows, possibly connected to form a larger object. The background is a \"7\".  Other numbers (colors) are grouped into bands or horizontal segments, which I will call \"objects\". The starting point of each row has a \"6\".\n\n1. **The \"6\" on the Left**:  It's always at the beginning. If the row has an object, the \"6\" stays put on the left side of the grid.  Sometimes, the \u201c6\u201d might disappear or move if there is a blocking object.\n2.  **The Right \"6\"**: In some cases, there's a \"6\" that magically appears near the end of the row. I discovered that this occurs only if the row is \"empty\" (only \"6\" and \"7\" characters) or if other rules are applicable based on the objects within each row. I believe it's somehow connected to the \"box\" concept or is the mirrored image of the Left \"6\", forming a kind of enclosing frame around the objects in the row.\n\nIt appears the \"6\" represents a 'door' or a limit.\n\nI believe in two fundamental modes or rulesets to solve this:\n\n**Slide Mode**: In the SLIDE mode (like Example 2), it looks simple. If a row is empty, the \"6\" moves to the right edge of the grid. If it has objects, the \"6\" stays on the left.\n\n**Frame Mode**: This is where things get interesting (like Example 1 and 3). Frame mode seems to apply if any row has an object at the right edge. In this case, I will apply the two rules below:\n    - Rule 1:  If the row has an object that 'touches' the right side, the left 6 disappears.\n    - Rule 2:  If the row is occupied but not at the right side, a right 6 is added to the grid. It does NOT appear if it is occupied by an object in the row.\n    - Rule 3:  Empty rows are special in this context. If neighboring rows are right-edge-touching (RET), then the empty row gets a Left 6 and a Right 6 (frame it with Magenta!).\n\nI have a feeling that objects within the grid that are \"close\" to the left edge seem to influence how the \"6\" behaves, particularly whether the Left \"6\" gets removed when the Right edge is touched by some other object. Also, objects touching the right side impact how the right \"6\" functions.\n\nTo solve this, I need to correctly identify which of these modes (SLIDE or FRAME) is in effect, based on whether the grid has an object that is in the rightmost column or not. I will proceed by: 1) Checking for rows with objects at the right edge; 2) Applying my \"Slide\" or \"Frame\" rule set accordingly.\n\nI also believe the rules for the \u201c6\u201d may depend on the placement of other objects. My theory here is the \u201c6\u201d is part of the rectangular grid structure. It's all about identifying the objects and how they might trigger the changes in \"6\" position and color changes to achieve a complete solution to this ARC task. Let's solve this!\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ARC task by inferring a \"latch/frame\" logic controlled by object positions.\n    \n    The rule logic inferred from training data:\n    1. Identify \"RET\" (Right Edge Touching) rows: Rows that have an object (non-6, non-7) at the last column (W-1).\n    2. Determine Global Mode:\n       - FRAME Mode: If at least one row in the grid is RET.\n       - SLIDE Mode: If no rows are RET.\n    3. Processing per row:\n       - \"Left 6\": The magenta bar at col 0.\n         - In SLIDE Mode: Kept unless row is empty (moves to right).\n         - In FRAME Mode: \n           - If row is RET: Kept ONLY if the row has objects starting near the left (col <= 2). Otherwise removed.\n           - If row is Empty: Kept if \"framed\" by RET neighbors (both prev and next rows are RET). Otherwise removed (slide).\n           - If Occupied (Not RET): Always Kept.\n       - \"Right 6\": A new magenta marker added on the right side.\n         - In SLIDE Mode: Added at `W-1` ONLY if row is Empty (slide behavior).\n         - In FRAME Mode:\n           - Target Column (TC) is `W-2`.\n           - If row is RET: Blocked (No Right 6).\n           - If row is Empty: Added at `TC` if framed by RET neighbors.

        "Full raw LLM call": "You are an expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect. You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Pythonic ARC Solver: Decoding the '6' Directive**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The challenge is to whip up a Python function, `solver(input_grid)`, that nails these ARC tasks. I see the heart of the solution lies in unraveling the '6' code. It's like a signal, a directive that dictates how the grid transforms.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the training examples. It seems the initial focus needs to be on identifying the rows, and their structures. Every grid has clear and distinct rows and columns. And then, there are these *objects* within the rows, and they are marked by specific colors. The magenta '6' pixel is the key player here.\n\nThe first key observation is how the '6' tends to \"bounce\" around, moving across the rows. It is present at index 0 or gets removed and added to the end. I need to formulate rules for this '6' motion.\n\nI'm starting to think this '6' is a projectile of some sort. It moves from left to right, but its path and final destination are influenced by the colors (objects) it encounters. The rule is likely a combination of these elements.\n\nTwo scenarios emerge. In the first case, the '6' stays where it is, and is re-issued at a new location. In the second case, it disappears from its original position and makes an appearance in a different location. The second case has rules to apply when to add the '6' on the right side. The '6' doesn't necessarily get a new position. I am looking for a general rule.\n\nThis '6' is a signal: it moves and marks. It triggers other changes. It's time to refine the logic for the moving projectile:\n\n*   **Mask Match:** If neighbor masks are identical, then '6' must go to other end (or remove itself).\n*   **Clean Separator, Two Pairs:** It stays, re-issued.\n\nThis is starting to look good. Need to get the right logic down and the right functions to apply the logic. Need to add exceptions to the first and last rows.\n\nEssentially, I'll loop through each row. If a row starts with a '6', I'll check its neighbors. If there is a Mask match, it is a deflection. If clean, and Pair-Pair, it's a duplication. Then there is the exception rule for the first and last rows (edge cases). The goal is to set the right functions, and apply the rules in the right order.\n\nI need to make sure the algorithm accounts for width and alignment to get everything right.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the grid based on the inferred rules:\n    The grid is composed of alternating Content Rows (even indices) and Separator Rows (odd indices).\n    Column 0 always contains 6s (projectiles/emitters).\n    \n    1.
