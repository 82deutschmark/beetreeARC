You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Algorithm for Solving ARC Tasks**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out.  I'm given a bunch of examples, and I need to figure out how to transform an input grid into an output grid. The tasks involve splitting the input into blocks, sorting them, and then reassembling them. Here are the key ideas:\n\n1.  **Separator Detection**: The first thing is to find \"separator lines\" in the input. These are full rows or columns filled with the same color. Usually, this color is 6, but I've added a check to find it automatically. The background color is typically 7, and I try to infer it. The grid is essentially divided into blocks by the separator lines.\n\n2.  **Input Layout Classification**: Once I've got the blocks, I need to figure out how the input is structured. Is it a grid (like a 2x2 or 3x3), or is it a strip (like a vertical stack or a horizontal strip)?  I check if there are separators in both rows and columns (grid), just rows (vertical strip), or just columns (horizontal strip).\n\n3.  **Count Non-Background Pixels**:  For each block, I count the number of pixels that are *not* the background color (usually 7).\n\n4.  **Sorting Logic**:  This is where things get interesting. I need to sort the blocks based on that count.  Here's the rule:\n    *   If the input layout is a **grid**, I sort the blocks in **ascending** order of count (smallest count first).\n    *   If the input layout is a **strip**, I sort the blocks in **descending** order of count (largest count first).\n    *   **Tie-breaker**: If blocks have the same count, I sort them by their original position in the input (I do this in descending order).\n\n5.  **Output Layout**: The way the blocks are *output* is determined by the *input* layout:\n    *   If the Input is a Vertical Stack, I'll output Horizontal.\n    *   If the Input is Horizontal Stack or Grid, I'll output Vertical.\n\n6.  **Reconstruction**:  Finally, I reconstruct the output grid. I take the sorted blocks and stack them either vertically or horizontally based on the output layout, inserting the separator lines between them.  If blocks have varying dimensions, I use the largest of width / height and fill the remaining space with the background color (7), aligning each block to the upper-left corner of each block placement.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the task by identifying subgrids separated by grid lines, sorting them based on\n    pixel counts and topological layout, and restacking them in a specific orientation.\n\n    Inferred Rules from Training Examples:\n    1. Identification: The grid is divided into subgrids (blocks) by separator lines (color 6).\n       The background color is 7.\n    2. Sorting Criteria:\n       - Subgrids are sorted primarily by the count of non-background pixels.\n       - If the input layout is a 2D Grid (rows and cols of blocks), sort by Count ASCENDING.\n       - If the input layout is a 1D Strip (only rows or only cols of blocks), sort by Count DESCENDING.\n       - Tie-breaker: If counts are equal, sort by the Original Index (reading order) DESCENDING.\n    3. Output Layout:\n       - If the input is a Vertical Stack (Nx1 blocks), the output is a Horizontal Stack (1xN).\n       - Otherwise (Grid or Horizontal Stack), the output is a Vertical Stack (Nx1).\n    \"\"\"\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    \n    # 1.

You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Solution Strategy**\n\nMy approach to solving this ARC task focuses on understanding how the input grid is transformed into the output.  I've analyzed the provided examples to identify key patterns and rules.\n\nFirst, I look for a separator color (usually magenta) that creates distinct blocks within the input grid. This separator forms horizontal and/or vertical lines, dividing the grid into sub-regions.  My initial step is to *detect the separator* and how the grid is split into blocks, which I then categorize into one of three layout types: a 2D grid of blocks, a vertical stack of blocks, or a horizontal row of blocks.\n\nThe transformation depends heavily on the initial layout.\n\n*   **For a 2D grid:** I extract each block and count the number of non-background pixels (ignoring the separator color, often orange). Then, the blocks are *sorted in ascending order* based on this pixel count. Finally, these sorted blocks are *stacked vertically* in the output. This applies to Example 1 and Probe 1.\n*   **For a vertical stack:** The blocks are simply *reversed* in order and then *stacked horizontally* in the output. This is how I explain Example 2 and Probe 2.\n*   **For a horizontal row:** The block order is *maintained* and then *stacked vertically* in the output. This is demonstrated in Example 3.\n\nEssentially, I'm detecting the structure and applying a different block arrangement method based on the input structure. \nI also detect the background color in the process to properly filter out the non-background pixels.\n\nMy code first identifies the separator color, then splits the grid into blocks. Then calculates the layout transform. Finally it reconstructs the output grid based on layout. This ensures that the output dimensions align with the examples.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the layout of sub-blocks separated by grid lines.\n    The rule inferred from training examples depends on the input block layout:\n    1. 2D Grid (e.g., 2x2 blocks): Sort blocks by the count of non-background pixels (ascending) and stack them vertically.\n    2.

You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

        "Full raw LLM call": "You are an expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect. You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA
