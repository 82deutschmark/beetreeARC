        "Full raw LLM call": "You are an expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect. You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Primary Objective: Deciphering the ARC-AGI Task**\n\nThe task at hand is to solve an ARC-AGI problem, guided by example inputs and expected outputs. I need to meticulously analyze the given training examples to identify the underlying pattern and establish a generalizable rule.\n\n**Initial Exploration:**\n\nMy investigation begins by parsing two training examples, examining input grids and the associated output. I begin by identifying the structures within the input grids: the size of the grids (20x20 in the input), colored shapes, the distribution of colors within these shapes, the presence of special \"noise\" pixels, and the size of output grids (8x8 in the first example). My first goal is to see if I can draw correlations between an Input shape and its related output area in the grid.\n\n**Hypothesis Building and Refinement:**\n\nI started with preliminary hypothesis that connected the \"noise\" pixels within one shape in the input with the composition of the output grids. This idea seemed to fall through when considering the second training example. I needed a more general theory.\nIt appears that there is one shape that acts as a \"source,\" holding a distinct pattern (noise or 2x2 blocks of colors). The other shapes in the input are \"canvases,\" where these color patterns translate to the output.\n\nI examined the shapes within the input grids, their relative positions, and the way the output grids are constructed.\n\n**Key Discoveries and Rules:**\n\n*   **The \"Source\" Shape:** This shape has unique characteristics, containing a 2x2 block of colors or \"noise\" pixels. It's essentially the key to the pattern.\n*   **\"Target\" Shapes:** The remaining shapes serve as \"target\" areas where colors from the source shape are applied.\n*   **The Clockwise Palette:** The colours in the source shapes are in order to the target shapes - reading clockwise starting from the top-left corner of the noise or pattern.\n*   **Color Mapping:** The relative position of the input shapes determines the colors they receive.\n*   **Bounding Box and Overlap:** The overall area size is the union of the bounding box of the input shapes.\n\n**Construction of the Output:**\n\nI deduced that the task involves a combination of color mapping, geometric transformation, and perhaps some form of occlusion or overlap logic. Shapes were drawn starting with the largest in area, on top of the smaller shapes.\n\n**Overcoming Challenges:**\n\nI needed to solve specific details on how output dimensions are determined, and to address tricky details like how the shapes are assembled or overlap. The most challenging aspect was to find the correct relationship between input shapes and final output structures.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1.  Identify Source Shape (2x2 Pattern).\n2.  Sort Shapes: (Y-order, X-Order).\n3.  Clockwise Palette, starting from top-left of pattern.\n4.  Map Shape to Palette Color based on order.\n5.  Position Shapes into Corners.\n6.  Handle Overlap (No Zeros = Correct Size).\n\nMy task is now to implement this strategy, ensuring it's robust enough to handle new inputs. I need to find the specific implementation of creating the output grid, the correct calculations for dimensions, and the way to draw and manage overlaps between shapes.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.ndimage import find_objects, measurements\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # 1.

        "Full raw LLM call": "You are an expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect. You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

I'm seeing rectangular, triangular and complex U-shaped objects, but the relationship is still unclear. In Example 1, I find a kind of enclosed \"container\" shape with other shapes inside. It has these pixels that are key for generating the solution. It's not a closed box, which is interesting. The output is a weird Voronoi-like pattern, with regions that correspond to those pixels inside the \"container.\"  It looks like a modified scaling. There are four 4x4 quadrants and each of them has one color. I'm noting the container shape, other shapes, and also the dimensions of the input and the output. I also look at their pixel arrangement in the input and output. I'm tracing the colours and their dimensions.\n\nExample 2 reinforces the idea of seeds contained inside a container, but it's a 10x10 output now, not an 8x8. The output is still a region of different color quadrants, but it has diagonal boundaries. The shape containing the seeds, I label this as the \"container.\" There's also other shapes that look like they play a role. I'm comparing the container shape and other shapes, and I'm looking at their dimensions in relationship to the output size.\n\nI'm thinking that the output grid is somehow determined by other shapes as well. I'm exploring various possibilities - from a simple scale-up of the seeds to something more complex, perhaps something related to a bounding box or the size of these container and non-container shapes, maybe one of the \"target\" shapes that correspond to output. I'm making sure to look for any hidden rules that are consistent in both of these examples. I need to understand what's unique to both of these, and then also what's common.\n\nI have found that the colors in both outputs have a consistent topological organization, but their precise shapes and arrangement depend on those \"seed colors.\"\n\n**Formulating Hypotheses and Refinement**\n\nThe container seems important because it contains the pixels that determine output colors and arrangement. I'm trying to identify a pattern regarding how the output size is determined, and how is the output organized. Is there a relationship between the container shape and other shapes in the image? Does the size of a unique shape define the output size?\n\nI'm considering a \"Voronoi\" diagram approach, with the seed locations determining the output regions. The container and shapes' centroids would serve as the seeds. I'm thinking I must map those centroids to some coordinates on the output, and I need to figure out how to scale. I have to find the pattern that tells me how to scale from the input space to the output space.\n\nThe seeds also appear to organize the image from TL to BR and that may not be a simple scaling. The output grids look like a scaled-up, distorted version of a simpler pattern. I'm trying to see if I can find an output mapping, that lets me take an arbitrary input and transform it into an output of arbitrary size. I'm thinking the colors are determined by locations in the input image.\n\nI'm focusing on \"dominant\" shapes and their locations. They appear to define quadrants on the output. How do you decide the correct output size? I'm exploring relationships between input bounding box, the seeds inside the container, and some sort of scaling ratio. I'm trying to see if there is a number in the input grid that is used to scale a 2x2 seed pixel to get the output. I'm struggling with the rule to predict output size. There has to be a consistent metric to get the final output. The \"other\" shapes also have positions (top-left, etc.) and color associated with them.\n\nI'm noting the output size isn't always related to the output size. One thing that matters is how much the input image is spread out. I think the area of all the other \"blobs\" and shapes in the image are important. The output is a distorted scaled up Voronoi of the shapes in the input.\n\n**Formulating the Algorithm and Validation**\n\nI'm looking at the training examples in an organized way, such that I can reproduce their answers. Based on the training examples, I'm finding the steps. The basic steps are: identify objects, analyze container to find \"seed\", find 4 main objects, assign colors.\n\nFrom the Bounding Box height, and the number of\n\nAn expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect has analyzed the task.\nThe user will find the `solver()` function below.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ARC task by reconstructing a Voronoi diagram based on input shapes and a color key.\n    \n    Inferred Rule:\n    1. Identify all connected component shapes in the input grid.\n    2. Identify a special \"Container\" shape which encloses a 2x2 block of distinct \"seed\" pixels.\n       The 2x2 block defines the color mapping for the Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, and Bottom-Right regions.\n    3. Identify the 4 main shapes in the input (one is the Container itself). \n       Classify them spatially as TL, TR, BL, BR based on their centroids.\n    4. Map the seed colors to these 4 shapes:\n       - The TL shape gets the color of the Top-Left seed.\n       - The TR shape gets the color of the Top-Right seed.\n       - And so on.\n    5. Determine the Output Grid size:\n       - Compute the Bounding Box (ROI) of all non-background pixels.\n       - The Output Size is roughly half the ROI size (downsampling by 2).\n       - If the ROI fills almost the entire input grid (margin <= 2), use InputSize // 2.\n       - Otherwise, use ROI_Size // 2.\n    6. Generate the Output Grid:\n       - For each pixel in the output, map it back to the input coordinate space (scaling by 2).\n       - Determine the pixel's color by finding the nearest Shape Centroid (Manhattan distance) \n         and using the assigned color for that shape.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    input_arr = np.array(input_grid)\n    H, W = input_arr.shape\n    \n    # 1.

You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA
