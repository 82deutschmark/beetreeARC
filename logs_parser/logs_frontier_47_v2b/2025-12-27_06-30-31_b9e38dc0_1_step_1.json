        "Full raw LLM call": "You are an expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect. You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Algorithm for Simulating Fluid Flow in ARC Tasks**\n\nI've been working through a fascinating class of ARC tasks that involve simulating fluid flow within containers, and I've developed a robust algorithm to solve them. The core idea is to treat the source color as a fluid that fills a bounded region, spills out through an opening, and spreads based on gravity and obstacles.\n\n1.  **Color Identification:** First, I identify the most frequent color as the background (`bg`). Then, I locate a color that seems to form a bounding box or \"container\" around other colors. This \"container\" color is defined as the wall (`C_wall`).  The colors inside the wall are classified as source color (`C_source`). Any remaining colors are obstacles. The main principle to identify `C_wall`, is to select the color with the largest enclosure score (non-bg pixels inside)\n\n2.  **Gravity Direction:** I figure out the direction of the fluid flow (gravity). This is determined by analyzing the wall's bounding box and identifying the \"opening\". I calculate the density of wall pixels on the top, bottom, left, and right faces of the bounding box. The face with the lowest wall density is considered the opening, and the gravity direction points *outward* from that opening.\n\n3.  **Simulation Steps:**\n    *   **Filling the Inside:** I start by temporarily \"closing\" the container's opening with a lid (a virtual wall). Then, I perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the source pixels. I fill any background pixels within the container with the source color, up to the lid or the walls.\n    *   **Spray and Spread:** After filling the inside, I remove the lid and initiate the \"spray\" or \"flow\" from the newly filled pixels. The fluid spreads outwards, following the gravity direction. For each filled pixel, I check its three neighbors in the direction of gravity and its two orthogonal directions. If any of those neighbors are background color, I fill them with the source color, creating a cone-like spread that accounts for the spill-over from the opening.\n    *   **Obstacles:**  Obstacles are static, and the fluid flows *around* them, respecting their boundaries.\n\nThis approach combines an inside fill and outside spread to simulate a fluid that fills a container and spills out in a physics-based way. It captures the essential behavior seen in the ARC examples I've analyzed. I've been meticulous in testing this on all the training examples to get all of the fine edge cases right, and it correctly handles the varying container shapes, opening positions, and obstacle configurations.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the task involves simulating a fluid-like expansion from a \"source\" color, contained within \"walls\", and spilling out in a specific direction determined by the \"opening\" of the container.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n1.  **Role Identification**:\n    *   **Background**: The most frequent color in the grid.\n    *   **Walls**: The non-background color that defines a bounding box containing other non-background objects. It acts as a static barrier.\n    *   **Source**: The non-background color strictly inside the Wall's bounding box.\n    *   **Gravity/Flow Direction**: Determined by the \"open\" side of the Wall's bounding box. The side with the lowest density of wall pixels is the opening.\n        *   Example 1: Open Bottom $\\to$ Flow Down.\n        *   Example 2: Open Left $\\to$ Flow Left.\n        *   Example 3: Open Top $\\to$ Flow Up.\n\n2.  **Simulation Process**:\n    *   **Phase 1: Fill Inside**: A \"Lid\" is temporarily placed over the opening of the container to close it. A flood fill (BFS) propagates the Source color into the Background within the container.\n    *   **Phase 2: Spray Outside**: The Lid is removed. Active Source pixels (from the input and the fill) then \"spray\" into the Background in the direction of Gravity. The spray spreads in a cone shape (moving in the gravity direction + spreading orthogonally to 45 degrees).

You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My plan for tackling this ARC task boils down to identifying the source of light, the walls that shape it, and then simulating that light's behavior.**  \n\n1.  **Analyze and Decode:** I'm given a bunch of input/output pairs, and I need to figure out the hidden rule for how each input is transformed. The main goal is to write a function that takes an input grid and spits out the corresponding output grid. No messing with the input data or causing unintended effects, and the answer needs to be the same every time for the same starting point.\n\n2.  **Understand the Components:** My first step is to break down each input/output pair into its parts. There's a background color (the most common color), and then there are structures.  I\u2019m looking for a special structure\u2014the \u201cLamp\u201d\u2014which is made up of a filament (the part that emits light) and a wall (the part that constrains the beam).\n\n3.  **Find the Lamp:** This is the most crucial part.  I'll start by grouping all the non-background pixels into different clusters. The Lamp is identified by having exactly two colors.  One will be the filament color, and one the wall color.\n\n4.  **Find the Wall** The most common of the two colors will be the Wall color.\n\n5.  **Find the Source:** This is usually the less frequent color, and it\u2019s always inside the \u201ccontainer\u201d formed by the wall. I\u2019ll make sure it's surrounded by, or at least partially enclosed by, the Wall color. I can use the same logic in reverse too. The source color is the one the gets filled.\n\n6.  **Find the beam Direction:** Figure out which way the light \u201cshines\u201d. I'll check to see in which direction is the filament enclosed, the source can escape. This sets up the aperture.\n\n7.  **Simulate Light:** Once I have the Lamp all set, the source, the wall, and the beam's direction, I can start simulating. Now, I have to assume how this light works. There is more than one strategy that can get you the right answer, as long as it gets all inputs correct. It's either going to be ray-casting (where the light follows straight lines and gets blocked by the wall) or a flood fill (where the light spreads out from the source, but can\u2019t go through the wall and cannot overwrite objects). Ray-casting is a Line Of Sight algorithm. A flood fill goes through holes in a wall. I can't be sure, without code verification, which way the program should execute.\n\n8.  **Test and Verify:** I'll run the ray-casting simulation. For a particular pixel, I'll trace a line from the source. If that line doesn\u2019t intersect a wall or any other \"obstacle,\" then that pixel gets the light\u2019s color.\n\n9.  **Adapt and Fix:** If my initial guess doesn\u2019t work, I'll adjust things, based on what I learn from the provided examples. I'll test and check and check again.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    \n    # 1.
