        "Full raw LLM call": "You are an expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect. You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Solver Strategy for ARC Tasks**\n\nAlright, the objective is to build a Python function, `solver(input_grid)`, that can solve the Abstract Reasoning Challenges. The analysis begins by meticulously examining the provided example inputs and corresponding outputs to understand the underlying transformation rules.  The primary focus is on identifying patterns, movement of objects, and how they interact with each other.\n\nThe initial thought is that some form of \"gravity\" or movement is involved.  In Example 1, a small red object stays put, a group of teal pixels (eight) form a static wall, and a set of yellow pixels seem to shift.  A hypothesis is formed: the yellow pixels are being pushed \"right\" until they hit a barrier. However, this is quickly challenged when considering the quantity of the shifted pixels doesn\u2019t precisely match the quantity of the receiving. This motivates a closer reading of what\u2019s happening.\n\nThere are many sub-hyptheses around the shift in pixels.  What is the force causing the change? Where do the pixels go?  This is made more difficult by the fact that the shift from one input to the next, is far from 1:1.\n\nThe analysis pivots to considering whether pixels are moving up, possibly in a diagonal-up-right direction. The analysis looks at the change from one pixel to the next and the possible patterns. This results in the hypothesis of a \u201cpush\u201d in a specific direction with obstacles like the eight. The hypothesis is formed that dynamic pixels might be \"shooting\" towards a distinct object.\n\nThe solution now goes into a more refined form of this: identifying the mover vs. the static object(s), their direction of movement. This is made difficult by the variability of these patterns across example problems. Some objects are diagonal, some are in clusters, and others are simple vertical.\n\nThe plan now is to see what the shape of the movers is and what the general direction of movement could be, in order to get a simplified form of these changes, and implement that.  After much tracing, it seems that there's not a single transformation, it's a combination of behaviors with a high-level goal of preserving a general shape and moving into an area that is available.\n\nAn approach involving pixel-wise movement (such as gravity or projectiles) is considered, but quickly discarded due to inconsistencies.  It\u2019s decided that objects must move according to a formula and if they collide, they may stack.\n\nThe focus shifts to understanding what makes some objects static and others dynamic and how to codify that. The initial idea of using a property on the colors in the grid is abandoned, and the hypothesis evolves to using the shape of the object. Clusters are considered static, where lines or diagonals are dynamic and move up.\n\nEventually, the following plan is formed:\n- Identify Background.\n- Identify Static vs Dynamic Objects.\n- Move dynamic to up and right, if it is a diagonal line.\n\nThere are multiple plans for this: using \"velocity\" of a form of gravity, and sliding to account for blocking.  The goal here is a heuristic solver, since there does not seem to be a single, straightforward set of transformations that is being made here.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ARC task by identifying static and dynamic objects and simulating movement.\n    \n    Inferred Rules:\n    1. Identify Background: The most frequent color.\n    2. Identify Static vs Dynamic Colors:\n       - 'Static' colors typically form solid walls, large blocks, or are anchored.\n       - 'Dynamic' colors typically form diagonal lines, scattered patterns, or are 'lighter' shapes.\n       - Heuristic: Colors that form diagonal structures (e.g. anti-diagonal or main-diagonal connectivity) \n         or are sparse are considered Dynamic. Colors that form solid vertical/horizontal lines are Static.\n    3. Movement Physics:\n       - Dynamic pixels move generally UP (-1, 0).\n       - If a pixel is blocked above, it may slide sideways (Left or Right) depending on the overall \n         'Diagonal Bias' of the shape.\n       - Ex 1: Yellow (4) forms an anti-diagonal (/) shape. Bias is Right. Moves Up, slides Right.\n       - Ex 4: Teal (8) forms a cluster. Moves Up. If blocked, slides (Left in this case).\n       - Generally, we apply a 'Float Up' force.

You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

        "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, here's my analysis of these ARC tasks and the design for a Python solver.\n\n**Problem Breakdown and Proposed Solution**\n\nI'm aiming for a `solver(input_grid)` function. My initial thought was a simple \"gravity\" model, but it became clear that it's more nuanced. The key seems to be identifying a *vertical barrier* column and some *fixed objects* within the grid. Everything else \u2013 the \"mobile\" objects \u2013 are then moved towards the barrier and/or top of the grid, essentially \"stacking\" up. This creates a kind of \"filling\" behavior, where the mobile pixels will try to occupy the best available slots based on a defined priority.\n\n**Key Observations**\n\n1.  **Vertical Barrier:** There's almost always a vertical line in the output, made of a consistent color or colors, that's fixed, the main structure. It acts as an obstacle. I identify the barrier by finding a column with a significant number of pixels of the same color, usually the rightmost one if there are ties.\n2.  **Fixed vs. Mobile Objects:** Non-background objects are categorized.  \"Fixed\" objects are those at the top or are high up, anchored, and don't get displaced. The other objects are mobile and need to be re-positioned. I define Fixed as being at the very top of the grid or \"higher\" than the barrier.\n3.  **Gravity and Filling:** The mobile pixels are subjected to the gravity, moving upwards and to the barrier column, filling the available spots.  This doesn't necessarily mean simple \"dropping\" \u2013 it's more like pixels trying to find a valid spot next to the barrier. There is some kind of a \"shape preservation\" constraint, where the relative positions of pixels should be maintained.\n4.  **Priority Queue for Optimal Placement:** The placement of Mobile objects (pixels) is key. The spots closest to the barrier, at the top, are preferable. I'll use a priority queue of open spots, where a cell's priority is based on how close it is to the barrier column.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\n1.  **Parse and Identify Parameters:** I'll begin by parsing the `input_grid` to find its height and width and get the background color. I'll search each column to find the column (and its color) with the longest vertical contiguous segment of pixels which determines my barrier.\n2.  **Identify Barrier & Fixed**: Then, I identify the Barrier column and color. Fixed colors are found from those that are positioned at the top of the grid or are higher up relative to the Barrier, which will not move, and the rest (mobile) are moved.\n3.  **Create \"Output Grid\":** Create a copy of the input, setting the mobile pixels to background.\n4.  **Build Target Queue:** To fill the grid I create a priority queue for possible cells to be filled, using a ranking heuristic that puts top rows with cells closest to the barrier at the top. I use a BFS approach so I can \"grow\" from the barrier/fixed pixels.\n5.  **Place Objects:** Finally, I'll take my list of mobile pixels and start assigning them positions in output grid, following BFS and my priority queue.\n6.  Handle edge cases if there are any that do not meet the set requirements for placement. I will use the set requirements to ensure the Mobile objects are stacked as described in each set of examples.\n\nI'm reasonably confident that this approach will handle most of the examples well, and it might work with some other tasks as well. I will have to test this.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.ndimage import measurements\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ARC task by modeling \"buoyant gravity\" towards a vertical barrier.\n    \n    Logic:\n    1.

The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA
