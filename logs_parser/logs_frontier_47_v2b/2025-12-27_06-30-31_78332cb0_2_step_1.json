        "Full raw LLM call": "You are an expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect. You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Solution for ARC Task Solver**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is a Python function, `solver(input_grid)`, that flawlessly handles the given ARC tasks.  I've thoroughly analyzed the examples, focusing on the transformations involved.  I've seen the inputs are split into blocks, rearranged and stacked or side-by-side, depending on the orientation.\n\nFirst, I need to reliably detect separators (like the magenta lines). I'll find rows or columns that are entirely the same color. Once I have the grid sections, I will identify the most frequent color, which is usually the background (orange, in these examples).  The blocks are then defined by the regions *between* the separator lines.\n\nThe core of the logic is sorting these blocks. The examples are a bit tricky. There's a rule!  I calculate the number of non-background pixels in each block and get a `count` for each one. The sort order has a few conditions. If there's an *odd* number of blocks, I sort in *descending* order based on the (count, original_block_index). If there's an *even* number of blocks, I sort in *ascending* order based on (count, original_block_index). I've got this because sorting by index alone preserves order when the counts are equal. That explains why, for one example, the order is reversed. This also means blocks with a lower original index will come before a block with the same non-background pixel count if the count is the same. That's crucial. I've got a solid test for it!\n\nThe last part is figuring out the final layout, is it horizontal or vertical? This is straightforward. If the input grid is taller than it is wide, the output is a horizontal strip of blocks. If it's wider than it is tall, or if it's square, then the output is a vertical stack of blocks. Easy!\n\nTo be precise, during reconstruction, I'll place the blocks in the sorted order, inserting separator lines (the magenta) between them. The separator will take up one row, if the layout is horizontal, or one column if the layout is vertical. The main things here are to make sure the shapes of the blocks are the same and that I can reliably find the background and separator.  With that in place, I'm confident my solution will be perfect. I'll test it thoroughly with the provided examples and any future challenge problems to make sure my logic is generalizable.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ARC task by:\n    1.

You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My primary objective is to develop a Python solver for an ARC task involving the transformation of an input grid into an output grid, leveraging insights from provided examples.** I've been diligently analyzing the structure of the grids in the solved examples (3) and probing inputs (2).\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:** I began by examining the structure of Example 1, noting the presence of rows or columns filled with the value 6 (magenta), which seems to act as a separator. I visualized the input as being partitioned into four quadrants by a cross of 6s, and carefully noted the contents of each quadrant. Subsequently, I examined the output, observing how the input quadrants were reassembled vertically, with rows of 6 separating them.\n\nThis led me to hypothesize an ordering: Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Top-Right, Bottom-Left. I verified the contents of the quadrants, and thought about the colors in those, and also thought about the count of the colors, like a red (count of 4) shape in the top left or a yellow (count of 6) shape in the top right, etc. I also thought about where those shapes were relative to each other.\n\nI then realized the order seems to be based on the count of pixels that are NOT 7 (which, based on the examples and the logic of the code, seems to be a special type of background). The panels with fewer such pixels are shown before those with more of them. Furthermore, in case of a tie in the pixel count, I noted a secondary ordering rule or \"tie-breaker\" - it seems those that appear earlier in a \"reading order\" (top to bottom, left to right) come first.\n\n**Example 2 and Beyond:** I turned my attention to Example 2 and 3, which had different input and output orientations (tall/wide). I tried to check the ordering here, and I noted it was the reverse! I realized there's something more subtle going on - the ordering itself depends on the structure of the input and output. I noticed a relationship between the input's shape (tall/wide/square-ish) and the output's structure.\n\n**The key is sorting and output shape.** The ordering is affected by whether the input is tall/wide. If the input is wide, the ordering is DESCENDING. If tall or square, it's ASCENDING, based on the number of non-7 pixels. The tiebreaker still works. I also observed that the output is Vertical if the input is Square or Wide, and Horizontal if the input is Tall.\n\n**The final Algorithm:** The rule I've derived involves several critical steps:\n1.  Parse the input grid into 5x5 panels separated by lines of 6s.\n2.  Count the number of non-7 pixels within each panel.\n3.  Based on the input's shape (tall/wide), sort the panels.\n    *   If Wide, Sort by descending count, Tiebreaker: -row, -col\n    *   Else (Tall or Square), Sort by Ascending count, Tiebreaker: -row, -col\n4.  Finally, construct the output grid based on whether the output should be horizontal or vertical.\n\nThis solver seems to be consistent across the solved and probe examples.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solver(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by extracting 5x5 panels separated by 6s,\n    sorting them based on the count of feature pixels (non-7),\n    and arranging them into a new layout (vertical or horizontal strip) based on input dimensions.\n    \n    The logic covers all training examples:\n    1.

        "Full raw LLM call": "You are an expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect. You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

        "Full raw LLM call": "You are an expert ARC-AGI Solver Architect. You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule

You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA

You will be given ARC task data containing:\n\n1) SOLVED TRAINING EXAMPLES (always present): multiple (input_grid \u2192 output_grid) pairs.\n2) PROBE INPUTS (always present): one or more input grids with NO outputs.\n\nThere is NO \u201cfinal test input\u201d in this prompt. The goal is ONLY to generate the best general `solver()` code from the provided solved examples, using probe inputs as additional unlabeled coverage.\n\nCRITICAL OUTPUT RULE (non-negotiable):\n- When answering, output ONLY raw Python code that defines `def solver(input_grid): ...` and returns the predicted output grid.\n- Output NOTHING else: no markdown outside the code, no explanations outside the code, no extra top-level definitions, no prints/logging, no I/O.\n- You MAY include detailed explanations inside the code as Python comments (including markdown-style headings/bullets) as long as the output is valid Python source.\n\nFUNCTION CONTRACT:\n- Signature: `def solver(input_grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:`\n- `input_grid` is a rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139.\n- Return a NEW rectangular list of lists of integers 0\u20139 (do not mutate `input_grid`).\n- Deterministic and pure: no randomness, no external state, no side effects.\n\nALLOWED / DISALLOWED TOOLS:\n- You may use `numpy` and `scipy` for efficient grid manipulation and structural analysis.\n- If you need other standard library modules, import ONLY inside `solver()` and keep it minimal.\n- For your convenience, `numpy` (as `np`), `scipy`, and common utilities from `collections`, `typing`, `copy`, `math`, and `itertools` are already pre-imported (e.g., `Counter`, `deque`, `defaultdict`, `deepcopy`, `List`, `gcd`).\n- No file/network access, no reading/writing, no debugging output.\n\nSILENT INTERNAL REASONING WORKFLOW (do this privately; never reveal chain-of-thought):\n1) From the SOLVED training pairs, generate multiple candidate transformation hypotheses.\n2) Validate each hypothesis against ALL solved training examples.\n3) If a hypothesis fails even ONE solved example, reject it immediately (no patching; no per-example branching).\n4) If multiple hypotheses fit ALL solved examples:\n   - Use the PROBE INPUTS as tie-breakers ONLY:\n     * Prefer hypotheses whose implied preconditions and decision points remain well-defined on ALL probes.\n     * Prefer hypotheses that do not require overly specific assumptions that probes contradict.\n   - Do NOT invent new rule steps solely to accommodate probes; probes may only help choose among training-consistent hypotheses.\n5) Prefer the simplest consistent rule (Occam\u2019s razor). Avoid unnecessary multi-stage pipelines.\n6) Consider at least one plausible alternative rule and silently reject it by identifying which solved example it contradicts (or why it becomes ambiguous on probes).\n7) Implement the final rule cleanly in code.\n8) Mentally test `solver()` on every solved training input to ensure it reproduces every solved training output exactly.\n\nHOW TO USE PROBE INPUTS (IMPORTANT):\n- Probe inputs have no outputs; do NOT try to \u201csolve\u201d them in text.\n- Treat probes as additional unlabeled samples from the same task family:\n  - They can reveal that \u201cuniqueness\u201d assumptions (e.g., \u201cthe only non-background object\u201d) are fragile.\n  - They can reveal that preconditions are too narrow (e.g., training had 2 colors but probes have 3).\n- Probes are NOT constraints that override solved training consistency. Training fit is mandatory.\n\nANALYZE & DECOMPOSE (use only what is supported by ALL solved examples; probes can support generality but not define the rule):\n- Dimensions: same size vs crop/pad/expand; infer output size from evidence, not assumptions.\n- Colors: sets and frequencies; background is often most frequent but MUST be verified (never assume background=0).\n- Objects: connected components (usually 4-neighborhood), lines, rectangles, holes/enclosures, bounding boxes, masks, centroids, adjacency/touching, containment.\n- Common transforms: translate, rotate, reflect, scale, crop, frame/border, fill, draw/extend rays until collision, copy/paste objects, pattern completion, recolor via consistent mapping, select object(s) by a consistent criterion.\n\nFORBIDDEN ANTI-PATTERNS (must not appear in code):\n- NO lookup tables or memorization (e.g., `if input_grid == train_input[i]: return train_output[i]`).\n- NO hardcoding fixed grid sizes, absolute coordinates, specific example outputs, or per-example branches.\n- NO assuming symmetry, tiling, repetition, or color semantics unless ALL solved examples prove it.\n- NO introducing new colors unless solved outputs prove new colors are required.\n\nFAIL-FAST REQUIREMENT (IMPORTANT):\n- The solver must NOT \u201cfail safe\u201d or silently guess when the input deviates from the inferred structure.\n- Derive explicit preconditions from the final training-consistent rule (e.g., \u201cexactly one object\u201d, \u201cexactly two colors\u201d, \u201cunique marker color exists\u201d, \u201cobject touches border\u201d, etc.).\n- Enforce those preconditions with `assert ... , \"clear message\"` or `raise ValueError(\"clear message\")`.\n- Do NOT wrap the whole solver in broad try/except that hides errors or returns fallback outputs.\n\nNOTE ON PRECONDITIONS:\n- Preconditions should be NECESSARY for the learned rule (not arbitrarily narrow).\n- Use probe inputs to avoid over-specifying preconditions when a simpler training-consistent rule would generalize better.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STYLE:\n- Write clear, general code.\n- Use small helper functions INSIDE `solver()` if helpful (e.g., flood fill, bounding box, rotate/flip, overlay).\n- Avoid global variables and caching across calls.\n- You may include detailed explanations as comments inside `solver()` describing the inferred rule and the derived checks.\n\nFINAL REMINDER:\n- Your final answer must be ONLY the Python code defining `solver(input_grid)` (comments inside the code are allowed) and nothing else.\n\n[ARC TASK DATA
