Looking at the examples, I need to identify the pattern:

## Pattern Analysis:

In both examples:
1. There are diagonal lines formed by a non-8 color (4 in Example 1, 3 in Example 2, 9 in the test)
2. These diagonal lines (moving down-left direction) create enclosed regions
3. The spaces **between** adjacent parallel diagonal lines are filled with color 2
4. The original non-8 color boundaries remain unchanged

## Test Input Analysis:

Let me trace the diagonal lines of 9s:

**Diagonal A:** (4,9) → (5,8) → (6,7) → (7,6) → (8,5) → (9,4)

**Diagonal B:** (5,13) → (6,12) → (7,11) → (8,10) → (9,9) → (10,8) → (11,7) → (12,6) → (13,5)

**Diagonal C:** (7,15) → (8,14) → (9,13) → (10,12) → (11,11) → (12,10) → (13,9) → (14,8) → (15,7)

**Short segment D:** (4,4) → (5,3)

## Applying the transformation:

For each row, I fill the spaces **between** adjacent diagonals with color 2:

- **Row 4:** Between cols 4 and 9 → fill 5-8
- **Row 5:** Between 3-8 → fill 4-7; between 8-13 → fill 9-12
- **Row 6:** Between 7-12 → fill 8-11
- **Row 7:** Between 6-11 → fill 7-10; between 11-15 → fill 12-14
- **Row 8:** Between 5-10 → fill 6-9; between 10-14 → fill 11-13
- **Row 9:** Between 4-9 → fill 5-8; between 9-13 → fill 10-12
- **Row 10:** Between 8-12 → fill 9-11
- **Row 11:** Between 7-11 → fill 8-10
- **Row 12:** Between 6-10 → fill 7-9
- **Row 13:** Between 5-9 → fill 6-8
- **Rows 14-15:** Only one diagonal, no enclosed region → no fill

## Output:
