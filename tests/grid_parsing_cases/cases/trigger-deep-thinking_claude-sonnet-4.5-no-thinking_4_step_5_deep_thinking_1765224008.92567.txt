Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.

## Analysis

The grids have a repeating background pattern of 5×5 blocks containing a specific shape (an inverted U or arch made of 0s, surrounded by 8s). This pattern tiles across the grid.

In the input grids, there are a few cells that deviate from this background pattern - they contain colors other than 0 or 8 (like 1, 4, 7). These anomalous cells mark special positions.

**Key observations:**

1. The background is a repeating 5×5 tiled pattern
2. Non-conforming colored pixels (not 0 or 8) appear at specific locations
3. These colored pixels seem to mark positions where transformations should occur

**Transformation rule:**

When a non-background color appears in the grid:
- It marks a specific 5×5 block in the tiled pattern
- In the output, that entire 5×5 block gets filled with the marker color
- Specifically, all the 0s within that block are replaced by the marker color
- The 8s in the block remain as 8s (preserving the block structure)

Let me verify this with Example 1:
- Input has a "4" at position (10,0) and an "8" where we'd expect "0" at positions in rows 5-9, columns 10-14
- Output shows the block at rows 10-14, cols 0-4 filled with 4s (replacing 0s)
- Output shows the block at rows 5-9, cols 10-14 filled with 8s (already correct)

This confirms the pattern.

## Applying to test input

Scanning the test input for anomalies:
- Row 0, col 0: has "1" (should be "0" in pattern)
- Row 0, col 5: has "1" (should be "0" in pattern)  
- Row 0, col 10: has "1" (should be "0" in pattern)
- Row 5, col 0: has "1" (should be "0" in pattern)
- Row 5, col 10: has "4" (should be "0" in pattern)
- Row 10, col 0: has "4" (should be "0" in pattern)
- Row 10, col 5: has "4" (should be "0" in pattern)
- Row 10, col 10: has "4" (should be "0" in pattern)

These mark three 5×5 blocks:
1. Block at rows 0-4, cols 0-4: fill 0s with color 1
2. Block at rows 5-9, cols 10-14: fill 0s with color 4
3. Block at rows 10-14, cols 0-4: fill 0s with color 4
