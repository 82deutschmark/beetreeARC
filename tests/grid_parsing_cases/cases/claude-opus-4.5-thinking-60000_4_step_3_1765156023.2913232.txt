Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation rule:

**Analysis of Examples:**

In both examples, diagonal lines of a non-background color (4 in Example 1, 3 in Example 2) form parallel line segments going from upper-right to lower-left (slope -1, where row + col = constant).

The transformation fills the interior regions between adjacent parallel diagonal lines with color 2 (red).

**Key observations:**
1. Multiple diagonal line segments share the same "intercept" (row + col value)
2. Between pairs of adjacent diagonal lines (consecutive intercept values), the interior space is filled with 2
3. The filling only occurs where diagonal line segments exist or overlap
4. Cells on the diagonal lines themselves remain unchanged

**Applying to Test Input:**

Identifying the diagonal lines (by intercept = row + col):
- Intercept 8: rows 4-5, cols 4-3
- Intercept 13: rows 4-9, cols 9-4  
- Intercept 18: rows 5-13, cols 13-5
- Intercept 22: rows 7-15, cols 15-7

For each row, I fill the interior cells between the diagonal markers:

- Rows 0-3: No diagonals, no changes
- Row 4: 9s at cols 4,9 → fill cols 5-8
- Row 5: 9s at cols 3,8,13 → fill cols 4-7 and 9-12
- Row 6: 9s at cols 7,12 → fill cols 8-11
- Row 7: 9s at cols 6,11,15 → fill cols 7-10 and 12-14
- Row 8: 9s at cols 5,10,14 → fill cols 6-9 and 11-13
- Row 9: 9s at cols 4,9,13 → fill cols 5-8 and 10-12
- Row 10: 9s at cols 8,12 → fill cols 9-11
- Row 11: 9s at cols 7,11 → fill cols 8-10
- Row 12: 9s at cols 6,10 → fill cols 7-9
- Row 13: 9s at cols 5,9 → fill cols 6-8
- Rows 14-15: Single diagonal point, no interior to fill
