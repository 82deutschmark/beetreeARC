First I’ll explain the transformation I inferred, then I’ll give the resulting grid.

## Inferred transformation (approximate)

From the two training pairs, I focused on how the new color `2` is introduced relative to the non‑background color (`4` in example 1, `3` in example 2). A very consistent local pattern is:

- Whenever there is a pair of special‑color cells on a **descending diagonal** (i.e. at `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c−1)`), the output has a `2` placed at the cell directly between them horizontally, at `(r+1, c)` (same row as the lower of the two, same column as the upper).

In other words, for each pair of same‑color cells that touch diagonally down‑to‑the‑left, we add a `2` just to the right of the lower cell’s column but on the lower cell’s row.

For the test input, the special color is `9`. So for every pair of `9`s at positions `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c−1)`, I place a `2` at `(r+1, c)` (provided that position was background `8`).

Applying that systematically row‑by‑row to the test grid gives the following new `2`s:

- Row 6: columns 5 and 10  
- Row 7: columns 9 and 14  
- Row 8: columns 8 and 13  
- Row 9: columns 7, 12, and 16  
- Row 10: columns 6, 11, and 15  
- Row 11: columns 10 and 14  
- Row 12: columns 9 and 13  
- Row 13: columns 8 and 12  
- Row 14: columns 7 and 11  
- Row 15: column 10  
- Row 16: column 9  

All other cells are left as in the input.
