Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:

1. **Pattern Identification**: Each example contains cross/diamond-shaped patterns with a uniform "border" color (4 cardinal directions) and a different "center" color.

2. **Chain Relationships**: Patterns form chains where one pattern's center value matches another pattern's border value (e.g., if pattern A has center=4 and pattern B has border=4, then A→B).

3. **5s as Boundaries**: The 5s form a path/boundary that divides the grid, determining which patterns survive and which are removed.

4. **Transformation Rule**:
   - Patterns on one side of the 5-boundary survive
   - Patterns on the other side are removed
   - Surviving patterns that point to removed patterns get their center updated to the removed pattern's center value

**Analyzing the test input:**

Cross patterns found:
- **A**: center (2,2), border=4, center=2
- **B**: center (1,7), border=2, center=3  
- **C**: center (6,4), border=1, center=9
- **D**: center (7,1), border=7, center=1
- **E**: center (6,8), border=3, center=3 (uniform, removed based on position)

Chain relationships:
- A (center 2) → B (border 2): A gets B's center (3)
- D (center 1) → C (border 1): D gets C's center (9)

The 5-boundary runs vertically through columns 6-7, then branches bottom-left. Patterns A and D are to the left (survive), while B, C, and E are to the right or enclosed (removed).

**Applying transformation:**
- Pattern A: Update center from 2 to 3
- Pattern B: Remove (set cells to 0)
- Pattern C: Remove (set cells to 0)
- Pattern D: Update center from 1 to 9
- Pattern E: Remove (set cells to 0)
