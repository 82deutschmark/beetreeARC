Looking at this problem, I need to identify the pattern from the examples.

## Analysis of Examples

**Example 1:**
- Input has a colored pixel `4` at position (10, 0) - left edge
- Input has a colored pixel that differs from pattern at (5, 10) - this appears to be a missing black cross
- Output: The `4` colored cross pattern at (10, 0) is expanded to fill that entire cross shape, AND the incomplete cross at (5, 10) is filled with color `8`

**Example 2:**
- Input has colored pixels: `7` at (0, 0), `1` at (5, 10), `4` at (10, 5)
- Output: Each of these positions has its corresponding cross shape filled with that color

## Pattern Discovery

The grid is composed of repeating cross/plus-sign patterns. The transformation rule is:
1. Find any cell that has a non-standard color (not 0 or 8, which form the background pattern)
2. That cell marks a cross pattern that should be filled entirely with that color
3. The cross pattern consists of a 5x5 block with the characteristic shape

Looking at the structure, each "cross" unit is:
- Row pattern (middle 3 rows): `8,0,0,0,0,8` or similar
- Top/bottom rows: `8,8,0,0,8,8` or similar
- The crosses are separated by rows/columns of `0,8,8,8,8,0`

## Applying to Test Input

Test input has colored markers:
- `1` at positions (0, 0), (0, 5), (5, 0) 
- `4` at positions (5, 10), (10, 0), (10, 5), (10, 10)

Each marker indicates which cross should be filled with that color.

Let me identify the cross positions in the 16x16 grid:
- Crosses are at column ranges: [1-4], [6-9], [11-14]
- Crosses are at row ranges: [1-4], [6-9], [11-14]
- Separator rows: 0, 5, 10, 15
- Separator columns: 0, 5, 10, 15

Mapping markers to crosses:
- (0,0) → top-left cross [1-4, 1-4] → color 1
- (0,5) → this is a separator position, affects top-middle cross
- (5,0) → left-middle cross [6-9, 1-4] → color 1
- (5,10) → middle-right cross [6-9, 11-14] → color 4
- (10,0) → bottom-left cross [11-14, 1-4] → color 4
- (10,5) → bottom-middle cross [11-14, 6-9] → color 4
- (10,10) → bottom-right cross [11-14, 11-14] → color 4

Output:

1,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,0
8,8,1,1,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,8
8,1,1,1,1,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8
8,1,1,1,1,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8
8,8,1,1,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,8
1,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,0
8,8,1,1,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8,4,4,8,8
8,1,1,1,1,8,0,0,0,0,8,4,4,4,4,8
8,1,1,1,1,8,0,0,0,0,8,4,4,4,4,8
8,8,1,1,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8,4,4,8,8
4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,0
8,8,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,8,8
8,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,8
8,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,8
8,8,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,8,8
0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,8,0
