Let me analyze the examples to understand the transformation.

In Example 1:
- There's a repeating 5x5 tile pattern in the grid
- A single colored marker (4) appears at position (10,0)
- In the output, the 0s in the tile below the marker are replaced with 4s
- Also, there's a change where a tile gets filled with 8s (creating a solid block)

In Example 2:
- Multiple colored markers: 7 at (0,0), 1 at (5,10), 4 at (10,5)
- Each marker indicates that the tile in the corresponding position should have its 0s replaced with that color
- The markers appear on the border between tiles, and they indicate which adjacent tile to fill

Let me understand the tile structure better:
- The grid appears to be made of 5x5 tiles
- Each tile has a pattern with 0s forming a cross-like shape in the center
- Markers appear at specific border positions between tiles

Looking more carefully:
- When a marker appears at a border position, it seems to indicate filling the adjacent tile's 0s with that color
- The direction from the marker determines which tile gets filled

In Example 2:
- Marker 7 at (0,0): fills the tile below-right (rows 1-4, cols 1-4) with 7s replacing 0s
- Marker 1 at (5,10): fills the tile below-right (rows 6-9, cols 11-14) with 1s
- Marker 4 at (10,5): fills the tile below-right (rows 11-14, cols 6-9) with 4s

For the test input:
- I see a marker 1 at position (5,5)
- This should fill the adjacent tile with 1s replacing 0s

Looking at row 5: `8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0`
The 1 is at column 5.

The tile structure seems to be 5-column wide tiles. Position (5,5) is at a tile border.

The marker at (5,5) should fill the tile to its upper-left (rows 1-4, cols 1-4) with 1s replacing the 0s.

Let me also check rows 0 and 10 for anomalies:
- Row 0: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0` - the first position should be 0, so this row is modified (all 8s except last)
- Row 10: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0` - similarly all 8s

This suggests tiles above and to the right of the marker get filled with 8s (blocking), while the tile in a specific direction gets the color.

Based on the pattern, the marker 1 at (5,5) means:
- Fill the tile below (rows 6-9, cols 1-4) with 1s replacing 0s
- The row of 8s at rows 0 and 10 should revert to normal pattern with 0s
