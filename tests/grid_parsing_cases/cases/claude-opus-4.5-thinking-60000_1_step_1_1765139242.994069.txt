Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation:

1. The non-background values (4 in Example 1, 3 in Example 2) form diagonal lines with slope -1 (going down-left)
2. The transformation fills the regions between pairs of parallel diagonal lines with 2s
3. The fill starts small when a region "opens" (both boundary lines become active), grows to full in the middle, and shrinks as lines converge or end

For the test input, I identify these diagonal lines (slope -1, row+col = constant):
- Line 1: (4,4)→(5,3), row+col=8
- Line 2: (4,9)→(9,4), row+col=13  
- Line 3: (5,13)→(13,5), row+col=18
- Line 4: (7,15)→(15,7), row+col=22

The regions between these lines should be filled with 2s:
- Region A: between Lines 1 and 2
- Region B: between Lines 2 and 3
- Region C: between Lines 3 and 4

Following the pattern from the examples (fill starts minimal, grows in the middle, shrinks at the end):
