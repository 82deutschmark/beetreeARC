### Reasoning

From the two training pairs we can infer:

- Each puzzle contains two very dominant “background” colors.  
- In the outputs, one of these backgrounds disappears and the other becomes the uniform background of the new grid.
- All other colors (the “objects”) keep their shapes; they are only translated, never resized or recolored.
- The dimension along which objects are spread more is kept (same width or same height as the original); the smaller dimension is cropped to the minimal band that contains all the objects.
- In the test case, colors `1` and `3` are the two most frequent.  
  The objects (colors `0,2,4,5,6,7,8,9`) all lie inside the region of color `1`, while the large area of color `3` is separate.  
  By analogy with the training examples, color `1` is the background that disappears, and color `3` becomes the new uniform background.

So we:
1. Take the minimal vertical band containing any non‑`1`/`3` color (rows 12–24 of the input).
2. Replace every `1` there by `3` (removing the old background).
3. Use exactly that band as the output (height 13, width 25), with all object cells preserved.
