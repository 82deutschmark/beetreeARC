Looking at this problem, I need to analyze how the transformation works in the examples.

**Pattern Analysis:**

In both examples, diagonal lines of non-background colors (4s and 3s) form boundaries. The transformation fills the interior regions between parallel diagonal lines with color 2.

The diagonals follow the pattern where `row + col = constant`. In both examples:
- The fill (2s) appears between adjacent parallel diagonal lines
- The 2s fill the interior between the diagonal boundaries
- There are gaps near the boundaries (typically 1 cell before the next diagonal marker)

**For the test input:**

The 9s form diagonal lines at:
- `row+col=8`: rows 4-5
- `row+col=13`: rows 4-9  
- `row+col=18`: rows 5-13
- `row+col=22`: rows 7-15

This creates corridors between these diagonal lines that should be filled with 2s.

Applying the transformation:
- Between adjacent 9s on each row, fill the interior with 2s
- The fill extends/contracts following the diagonal structure
- Leave appropriate gaps near boundaries (similar to examples)

**Output:**
