Let me analyze this step by step.

## Understanding the Pattern

Looking at the examples:

**Example 1:**
- Input has two single-pixel markers: `4` at position (10,0) and `8` at position (5,10)
- The pattern consists of repeating "cross" shapes made of black (0) cells surrounded by 8s
- In the output:
  - The cross near the `4` marker gets filled with color `4`
  - The cross near the `8` marker (which should be different from background 8s) gets filled with `8`s (making it disappear into background)

**Example 2:**
- Input has three single-pixel markers: `7` at (0,0), `1` at (5,10), and `4` at (10,5)
- In the output:
  - The cross in the top-left region gets filled with `7`
  - The cross in the middle-right region gets filled with `1`
  - The cross in the bottom-middle region gets filled with `4`

## Key Observations

1. The grid has a repeating pattern of crosses (plus shapes) made of 0s
2. Single-pixel markers (colors different from 0 and 8) indicate which crosses should be recolored
3. Each marker is placed on the border/edge of a 5×5 block that contains a cross
4. The cross in the same 5×5 block as the marker gets filled with that marker's color
5. The markers themselves are removed in the output

## Test Input Analysis

Looking at the test input, I need to identify the markers:
- Row 0: `1` at positions (0,0), (0,5), (0,10)
- Row 5: `1` at (5,0), `4` at (5,10)
- Row 10: `4` at positions (10,0), (10,5), (10,10)

The grid is divided into 5×5 blocks (rows 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15; cols 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15).

Each cross pattern occupies rows i+1 to i+4 and columns j+1 to j+4 within each 5×5 block.

Markers at block boundaries indicate which cross to fill:
- `1` at (0,0) → fill cross in block rows 0-4, cols 0-4 with color `1`
- `1` at (5,0) → fill cross in block rows 5-9, cols 0-4 with color `1`
- `4` at (5,10) → fill cross in block rows 5-9, cols 10-14 with color `4`
- `4` at (10,0) → fill cross in block rows 10-14, cols 0-4 with color `4`

The crosses are located at:
- Block (0-4, 0-4): rows 1-4, cols 1-4 (center at 2-3, 2-3)
- Block (5-9, 0-4): rows 6-9, cols 1-4
- Block (5-9, 10-14): rows 6-9, cols 11-14
- Block (10-14, 0-4): rows 11-14, cols 1-4
