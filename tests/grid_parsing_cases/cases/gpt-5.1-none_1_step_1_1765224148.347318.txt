First, I’ll describe the pattern from the examples, then apply it to the test grid, and finally give the full output grid.

---

## 1. Understanding the Pattern

The base structure in all given grids (examples and test) is a repeating “frame” pattern made of colors 8 and 0 with a hollow center of 0’s. Inside that, some cells differ (non-8, non-0 values like 4, 7, 1, etc.). Those are the “special colors.”

Observations from the solved examples:

- The grid is made from repeating 5×5 “tiles” of a frame-like 8/0 pattern, but we can treat the whole thing as one big pattern with a lot of internal repetition.
- In the **input**, you see:
  - Mostly 8’s and 0’s in a fixed pattern.
  - A **single special cell** of a color c (e.g., 4 or 7 or 1) somewhere within this pattern.
- In the **output**:
  - The basic 8/0 frame pattern is *mostly* preserved.
  - Around the location of the special color c, a **4×4 filled block of color c** is drawn, replacing 0’s and 8’s in that region, but only within a single “logical block” of the pattern.

Looking at Example 2 more concretely:

- Example 2 Input has three special colors: 7 at (0,0), 1 at (5,10), 4 at (10,5).
- Example 2 Output:
  - A 4×4 block of 7 fills around the 7 in the top-left area.
  - A 4×4 block of 1 fills around the central 1.
  - A 4×4 block of 4 fills around the lower middle 4.

The **position** of the 4×4 block relative to the special cell follows the same scheme each time:

- The special color is initially sitting in a 5×5 tile-like area of zeros, and the 4×4 square is aligned with that area:
  - The 4×4 block is the *interior* of a 5×5 segment of the frame pattern.
  - In the examples, the special colored cell lies on the border between tiles, but the output always shows that the 4×4 square is the contiguous 4×4 zero-area that sits exactly under/around that special cell location.

In practice, in these particular tasks, the 4×4 block coordinates are consistent:

- For the central 1 in Example 2, which appears inside a row identical to the “horizontal 8-bar”, the 4×4 of 1’s replaces the central 0-region bounded by that bar above and below and the frame columns left and right.
- Each special point triggers *one* contiguous 4×4 block of that color in the appropriate “void” region of the frame pattern.

The first example shows the same thing for color 4: the input has a lone 4 in the bottom-left of the main pattern; the output shows two 4–blocks:
- One in a central region,
- One mirrored lower,
but both clearly aligned on that same interior “hole” in the 8/0 pattern, and both 4×4.

The key operational rule for this puzzle instance is:

> For each non-0, non-8 special color in the input, find the 5×5 “hole” (the internal zero-region) where it lies in or adjacent, and fill the 4×4 interior of that hole with that color.

## 2. Applying to the Test Input

Test input (21 rows by 16 columns) has:

- Mostly the standard frame of 8’s and 0’s.
- A **single special value 1**, located at row 5, column 5 (0-based indexing: r=5, c=5). Here’s the row with that 1:

Row 5 (0-based):
`8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0`

In the previous examples, rows made entirely of 8 except for one boundary 0 on each end function as the horizontal “frame bars” that bound an interior zero region vertically. The special 1 is sitting in such a bar, similar to how the 1 sits at (5,10) in Example 2.

From Example 2:

- The 1 at (5,10) leads to a 4×4 block of 1’s spanning rows 7–10 and columns 11–14 (0-based).
- That 4×4 block is located *below* the bar containing the 1, and inside the central hole region bounded by the repeating frame pattern.

In the test grid:

- The 1 is at (5,5), in essentially the same relative context (a full-height horizontal bar).
- The interior hole below that bar is the typical 4×4 zero-area between frames.
- Therefore, the 4×4 block of 1’s will appear in that interior region directly beneath the row of the 1, aligned horizontally with the hole.

Concretely, using the pattern of the existing 0-holes:

- Consider the rows 7–10 and columns 7–10 as the central 4×4 hole we see repeated in this pattern, but here our special color is in a bar further left; in this test, the way the pattern is laid out, the relevant 4×4 zero block is:

Rows 7–10 (0-based), columns 7–10 (0-based):

Let’s check those cells in the given test input:

Row 7: `8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8`
- Columns 7–10: `0,0,0,0`

Row 8: `8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8`
- Columns 7–10: `0,0,0,0`

Row 9: identical row: columns 7–10: `0,0,0,0`

Row 10: `8,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,8`
- Columns 7–10: `0,0,8,8` (so the 4×4 zero hole is actually rows 7–9, columns 7–10, and row 10, columns 7–8).

But in Example 2, the 4×4 block replaces both zeros and some bordering 8’s as necessary to make a solid 4×4 square within overlapping tile boundaries, so we do the same: we overwrite that entire 4×4 area with 1, even where there are 8’s.

Matching Example 2’s structure (where the bottom row of the 4×4 1-block partially overlaps 8’s), we choose the same relative alignment:

Thus for the test grid, the 4×4 block of 1’s will be:

- Rows 7, 8, 9, 10
- Columns 7, 8, 9, 10

We will overwrite those 16 cells with 1’s.

Everything else remains the same as in the input.

Now let’s apply that edit.
