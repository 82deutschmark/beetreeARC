**Explanation of the transformation**

1. In the examples, each task grid has:
   - Two “background” colours.
   - Other colours forming compact rectangular (or rectangular‑shaped, multi‑coloured) objects.
   - A separate region made only of the two background colours that contains rectangular “slots” of one background colour.

2. The transformation is:

   - Let \(B_1\) be the background colour that is used inside the objects and in the slots.
   - Let \(B_2\) be the other background colour (the one that becomes the uniform background of the output).
   - Identify all objects in the **object region** as 4‑connected components whose colours are not \(B_1\) or \(B_2\).
   - For each object, take its bounding rectangle (height and width) and its colour pattern.
   - In the **slot region**, find a set of disjoint rectangles consisting only of colour \(B_1\), whose sizes (height × width) match exactly the multiset of object bounding boxes. These are the slots.
   - Map objects to slots by dimension; where several objects and slots share the same size, pair them by top‑left position order (scan objects and slots top‑to‑bottom, left‑to‑right).
   - The output grid is the slot region only. First recolour every cell of \(B_1\) in this region to \(B_2\). Then, for each slot, paste the corresponding object’s colour pattern into that rectangle. \(B_1\) does not appear in the output.

3. For the **test input**:

   - The only colours in the top 10 rows are 1 and 3.  
     In the lower part (rows 12–24) there is colour 1 plus many other colours (2,4,5,6,7,8,9,0).  
     Hence:
       - \(B_1 = 1\) (interior/floor colour),
       - \(B_2 = 3\) (wall/background colour).
   - The **slot region** is rows 1–10 (only 1 and 3).  
     The **object region** is rows 12–24 (where the non‑{1,3} colours occur).

   - In the object region we find 16 rectangular components (bounding boxes):

     - A: 8×2 block of 9s at rows12–19, cols2–3.
     - B: 6×5 block of 6/8 pattern at rows12–17, cols8–12.
     - C: 6×2 block of 4s at rows12–17, cols16–17.
     - D: 7×3 block of 2/5/2 pattern at rows12–18, cols20–22.
     - E: 6×2 block of 4s at rows18–23, cols5–6.
     - F1: 1×2 block of 9s at row18, cols16–17.
     - F2: 1×2 block of 9s at row24, cols5–6.
     - G: 2×4 block of 7s at rows19–20, cols8–11.
     - H: 2×2 block of 8s at rows20–21, cols23–24.
     - I: 2×2 block of 8s at rows22–23, cols2–3.
     - J: 3×2 block of 5s at rows21–23, cols15–16.
     - K: 4×1 column of 6s at rows21–24, col20.
     - L1–L4: four single 0s at (22,8), (22,10), (24,8), (24,10).

   - In the top region we partition all 1‑cells into 16 disjoint rectangular slots whose sizes exactly match these objects:

     - 6×5 at rows3–8, cols12–16.
     - 8×2 at rows2–9, cols23–24.
     - 7×3 at rows3–9, cols1–3.
     - 6×2 at rows3–8, cols4–5.
     - 6×2 at rows3–8, cols8–9.
     - 2×4 at rows4–5, cols17–20.
     - 2×2 at rows3–4, cols6–7.
     - 2×2 at rows6–7, cols10–11.
     - 3×2 at rows3–5, cols21–22.
     - 4×1 at rows6–9, col25.
     - 1×2 at row2, cols4–5.
     - 1×2 at row2, cols8–9.
     - four 1×1 slots at (2,14), (3,19), (6,19), (7,7).

   - Mapping objects to slots by size and scan order yields the placements described in the reasoning above.

   - Finally, we take the slot region (rows1–10), recolour all 1s to 3 (so the base is all 3), and then paste the object patterns into their slots.

The resulting output grid (10×25) is:

Row1: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  
Row2: 3,3,3,9,9,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3  
Row3: 2,2,2,4,4,8,8,4,4,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,0,3,5,5,9,9,3  
Row4: 2,5,2,4,4,8,8,4,4,3,3,6,8,6,8,6,7,7,7,7,5,5,9,9,3  
Row5: 2,2,2,4,4,3,3,4,4,3,3,6,6,8,6,6,7,7,7,7,5,5,9,9,3  
Row6: 2,5,2,4,4,3,3,4,4,8,8,6,8,6,8,6,3,3,0,3,3,3,9,9,6  
Row7: 2,2,2,4,4,3,0,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,6  
Row8: 2,5,2,4,4,3,3,4,4,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,6  
Row9: 2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,6  
Row10:3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3

So the completed output grid is:

3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  
3,3,3,9,9,3,3,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,3  
2,2,2,4,4,8,8,4,4,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,0,3,5,5,9,9,3  
2,5,2,4,4,8,8,4,4,3,3,6,8,6,8,6,7,7,7,7,5,5,9,9,3  
2,2,2,4,4,3,3,4,4,3,3,6,6,8,6,6,7,7,7,7,5,5,9,9,3  
2,5,2,4,4,3,3,4,4,8,8,6,8,6,8,6,3,3,0,3,3,3,9,9,6  
2,2,2,4,4,3,0,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,6  
2,5,2,4,4,3,3,4,4,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,6  
2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,9,9,6  
3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
