Looking at the examples, I can identify the following transformation rules:

1. **Find the 3 marker** - Acts as a starting point for the path
2. **Find patterns of 1s and 2s** - These are horizontal lines of numbers
3. **Replace all 1s with 2s** in the patterns
4. **Draw L-shaped paths with 3s** connecting from the marker through the grid

The L-shaped paths follow these rules:
- The first turn row = marker row + min(distance to left edge, distance to right edge) of the first pattern
- Subsequent turn rows = midpoint between consecutive pattern rows
- Turn columns are calculated based on offsets from pattern edges
- Path direction alternates (or goes away from the pattern center)

For the test input:
- 3 marker at (0, 8)
- Pattern 1: row 3, columns 4-15
- Pattern 2: row 9, columns 0-6  
- Pattern 3: row 17, columns 6-15
- Pattern 4: row 27, columns 0-8

Calculating the path segments and turn points, then replacing 1s with 2s:
