I'll explain the pattern I inferred, then give the output grid.

## Reasoning

From the two examples, we can see:

- The background color is 8.
- A different color appears as a set of points forming **closed, roughly diagonal loops or hulls**:
  - In Example 1, color 4.
  - In Example 2, color 3.
- The output keeps those original colored pixels the same, but **fills certain completely enclosed regions** with color 2.
- Where there is **no closed region** formed by the non‑8 color, **no fill is added**.

In the training examples, the non‑8 cells form clear enclosing structures so that some 8‑cells inside are fully surrounded (in a diagonal sense), and those interior 8‑cells are turned into 2.

In the test input, the 9s form several diagonal lines and branches, but they **do not form any single closed loop that traps background cells completely inside**. In other words, there is no region of 8s that is fully surrounded by 9s the way 3s and 4s do in the examples.

Under the inferred rule:
- Only completely enclosed “holes” inside a loop of the special color are filled with 2.
- Since the 9s in the test grid do not enclose any such hole, **no cells should be changed**.

So the output should equal the input.
