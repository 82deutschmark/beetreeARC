Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.

## Analysis of Examples

**Example 1:**
- Input has a `4` at position (10, 0) and an `8` at position (5, 10) where it should be `0`
- Output: The `4` is moved/expanded to fill a 3x5 diamond-like pattern in rows 11-14, columns 1-4
- Also, rows 6-9, columns 10-15 are filled with `8`s (filling what should have been a hollow diamond)

**Example 2:**
- Input has a `7` at position (0, 0), `1` at position (5, 10), and `4` at position (10, 5)
- Output: 
  - `7` fills the diamond pattern at rows 1-4, columns 1-4
  - `1` fills the diamond pattern at rows 6-9, columns 12-15
  - `4` fills the diamond pattern at rows 11-14, columns 6-9

## Pattern Recognition

The grid has a repeating pattern of hollow diamonds (made with 0s and 8s). The transformation:
1. Find cells with non-0, non-8 values (anomalies)
2. These anomalies mark positions where a diamond should be filled
3. Fill the corresponding diamond pattern with the anomaly color
4. The diamond to fill appears to be in the same "block" or nearby block based on the position

Looking more carefully at the structure:
- The grid is made of repeating 5-row blocks separated by horizontal lines (rows of pattern `0,8,8,8,8,0...` or `8,8,8,8,8...`)
- Each block has a hollow diamond pattern (4 inner rows)
- When an anomaly appears on a separator row, it indicates which diamond to fill

**Test Input Analysis:**
- There's a `1` at position (5, 5)
- Row 5 is a separator row: `8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0`

The `1` at column 5 suggests filling the diamond in the block that contains column 5, which would be the first diamond (columns 1-4) in rows 6-9.

Let me trace through where diamonds are:
- Block 1 (rows 1-4): diamonds at columns 1-4, 6-9, 11-14
- Block 2 (rows 6-9): diamonds at columns 1-4, 6-9, 11-14  
- Block 3 (rows 11-14): diamonds at columns 1-4, 6-9, 11-14
- Block 4 (rows 16-19): diamonds at columns 1-4, 6-9, 11-14

The `1` at (5, 5) is between blocks 1 and 2, at column 5 which is between the first diamond (cols 1-4) and second diamond (cols 6-9). Looking at the examples, the anomaly seems to indicate the diamond in the NEXT block at the corresponding position.

Given column 5 is right after columns 1-4, this should fill the diamond at rows 6-9, columns 1-4 with color `1`.
