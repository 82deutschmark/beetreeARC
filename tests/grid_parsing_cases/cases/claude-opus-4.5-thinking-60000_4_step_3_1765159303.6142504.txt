Looking at the examples, I can identify these transformation rules:

1. **Find the marker "3"** - This acts as a reference point
2. **Find patterns of 1s and 2s** - These are linear patterns (horizontal or vertical lines)
3. **Convert all 1s to 2s** - The pattern becomes uniform 2s
4. **Draw an L-shaped or connected bracket of 3s** - The bracket wraps around from the 3 marker toward the patterns, creating enclosures

For the test input:
- The 3 is at position (6, 25)
- Pattern 1: vertical at col 1, rows 0-5 (1 at row 0)
- Pattern 2: vertical at col 7, rows 5-13 (1s at rows 11, 13)
- Pattern 3: vertical at col 17, rows 0-9 (1s at rows 0, 2, 4)

The transformation:
1. Convert all 1s to 2s
2. Draw bracket of 3s connecting from the 3 position, wrapping around the patterns with vertical segments at cols 0, 6, 8, 18 and horizontal segments at rows 6 and 10
