Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.

## Analysis of Examples

**Example 1:**
- Input has a `4` at position (10, 0) and an `8` at position (5, 10) where normally there should be `0`
- Output: The region around the `4` (rows 11-14, cols 2-4) gets filled with `4`, and the region around the anomalous `8` (rows 6-9, cols 11-15) gets filled with `8`

**Example 2:**
- Input has `7` at (0, 0), `1` at (5, 10), and `4` at (10, 5)
- Output: Three regions get filled with their respective colors:
  - Region around `7` at (0,0): rows 1-4, cols 2-4 filled with `7`
  - Region around `1` at (5,10): rows 6-9, cols 12-14 filled with `1`
  - Region around `4` at (10,5): rows 11-14, cols 7-9 filled with `4`

## Pattern Recognition

The grid has a repeating pattern that creates rectangular "blocks" separated by borders. Each block has:
- A top/bottom border row (pattern: 0,8,8,8,8,0 or 8,8,8,8,8,8...)
- Interior rows with a distinctive pattern containing 0s in the middle

When a non-standard color appears at a border position, the transformation fills the interior of the corresponding block with that color. The interior consists of:
- The 2x2 center area (positions where there are normally 0s)
- Expanded to include adjacent 0s forming a cross-like pattern

## Test Input Analysis

Looking for anomalies in the test input:
- Position (5, 5): has `1` (should be `0` or `8` in the border pattern)

The block containing this marker appears to be in rows 6-9. Looking at the standard pattern, the interior positions that should be filled are columns 7-9 (the middle section of that block).

Let me trace through the blocks:
- Rows 0-4: First block (row 0 is border)
- Rows 5-9: Second block (row 5 is border with the `1` marker)
- Rows 10-14: Third block (row 10 is border)
- Rows 15-19: Fourth block (row 15 is border)
- Row 20: Final border

The marker `1` at position (5,5) indicates that the block from rows 6-9 should have its interior filled. Looking at columns, the pattern suggests the block is around columns 5-9, and the interior to fill would be columns 7-9.

Actually, reviewing more carefully: the interior pattern in rows 6-9 at columns 7-9 contains positions (6-9, 7), (7-8, 7-9), (6-9, 9) that form the typical "0" interior.
