Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:

1. A row with 4s (marker) defines a vertical stripe through the grid
2. The stripe extends from the marker to the opposite end of the grid
3. The row opposite to the marker gets 3s at stripe positions
4. For blobs (connected regions of 6s/8s/2s):
   - The widest row of each blob that intersects the stripe gets converted to 3s across its full extent
   - The first and last rows of a blob's stripe intersection get 4s at stripe positions
   - Interior rows get background at stripe positions (cutting through the blob)
5. Rows with colored pixels only within the stripe (no extension outside) become background

For the test input:
- Marker is at row 0, cols 7-14
- Row 24 (opposite end) gets 3s at stripe positions
- Large blob spans rows 3-11: widest row is row 5 (15 cells) → gets 3s
- Small blob at rows 13-14: row 13 intersects stripe and gets 3s
- Large blob spans rows 15-24: widest row is row 17 (16 cells) → gets 3s
- Row 3 has 6s only within stripe → becomes background
- Rows 4, 11, 14, 15, 19 are boundary rows → get 4s at stripe
- Interior rows get background at stripe positions
